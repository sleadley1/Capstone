## Problem Statement
Publicly traded companies release annual reports outlining how the company has performed over a given period. The information contained in this report includes financial data as well as a letter from the CEO or chairman. The reports are relied heavily upon to value and assess companies in the investment management industry. While many investment analysts focus on the financial data and metrics within these reports, letters to shareholders also offer interesting insights and explanations as to why the company performed the way it did. Leveraging natural language processingI intend to automate the process of reading and determining the sentiment of said letters to assess their sentiment. I hope to be able to utilize this analyzer for other text based financial data like management commentaries and transcripts of earnings calls.
