1,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2000, was a remarkable year for goldman sachs and a rewarding one for our shareholders in our first full year as a public company we posted record earnings of  billion up  from  billion in  earnings per diluted share rose to  a  increase from  in  and our return on equity reached  these results reflect more than a very good year for a number of our businesses they are also evidence of our continued progress toward our goal of becoming the preeminent global investment banking and securities firm this goal is underpinned by a strategy that emphasizes expanding in key markets our core businesses global capital markets investment banking and trading and principal investments and asset management and securities services our goal is for goldman sachs to be the financial advisor of choice for the most important and influential corporations institutions and individuals worldwide it is critical that we capture  and keep  a leading share of the high valueadded business of these clients in  we experienced marked success in doing so in investment banking for instance we were the number one advisor in merger transactions on a worldwide basis goldman sachs advised on a total of  trillion in announced transactions including seven out of ten of the largest in the world we hold strong leadership positions in key growth industries including telecommunications financial institutions technology healthcare and energy goldman sachs was also the number one global underwriter of initial public offerings ipos and all common stock offerings in addition we improved our highyield underwriting business finishing the year with the number two market share in the united states in  we also continued to expand our most profitable trading businesses we placed a special emphasis on clientdriven transactions and solving complex problems with highly tailored solutions during the course of the year we succeeded in increasing our trading revenues while lowering risk in fixed income currency and commodities ficcnet revenues grew by  despite difficult market conditions our equities business posted spectacular gains with net revenues up  over  in october we strengthened our capabilities in the equity market through our combination with spear leeds  kellogg an industry leader in securities market making and clearing in principal investments we substantially expanded our global platform raising  billion in new private equity and real estate funds goldman sachs now manages more than  billion of merchant banking investments for our clients and our own account asset management and securities services also generated strong growth in  net revenues rose  from  and assets under management reached  billion a  increase over the previous year since  our assets under management have expanded at an average rate of  per year making us one of the fastest growing large asset managers in the industry in  we added  billion of new client assets building on  billion and  billion increases in  and  respectively this growth is testimony to both our investment record and distribution power we see attractive growth opportunities in the highnetworth market and are investing to capture an increasing share of it a strong capital position is an important part of our strategy indeed one of the principal reasons we became a public company was to secure the permanent capital necessary to serve our clients better since our ipo our equity capital has grown from  billion to  billion despite this increase we remain as disciplined about our capital as we were when we were a private partnership our capital is available to help clients meet their important needs but we use it carefully for those transactions where we can combine it with our expertise and where we believe that the potential rewards justify the risk we owe our shareholders no less we continue to compete with firms with more capital than goldman sachs and in  we continued to compete successfully the reason is simple our clients choose us not just because of our balance sheet but because of even more important assets  our reputation for excellence and our people who provide the very best advice and execution our distinctive culture  which emphasizes integrity entrepreneurship excellence teamwork and fairness  has allowed us to assemble the most talented team in the business our ipo further strengthened our culture by giving all our employees a stake in the firms future today the people of goldman sachs own more than  of the firm making us one of the largest employeeowned companies in the world and the employer of choice in our industry it is critical that goldman sachs continue to be a magnet for talent at both senior and entry levels this is why attracting retaining and rewarding the very best individuals was one of our highest priorities in  as part of this effort in november we expanded our senior leadership by selecting  new participating managing directors and naming  new managing directors these individuals  the most diverse group of senior leaders we have ever chosen  combine tested professional excellence with a strong personal commitment to our core values we are proud of our accomplishments in  our scope was truly global with european and asian operations representing more than  of our workforce and more than  of our net revenues in key businesses  advisory services underwriting and trading  we are leaders in every important market in the world and our asset management business already strong is poised for even more global growth in the future in  we were fortunate to exceed again our financial goals of a return on equity of more than  and earnings growth in the  range these remain our objectives but looking forward we do not expect a predictable stable pattern of quarteroverquarter earnings increases goldman sachs will continue to seek faster growth in our investment banking and asset management businesses to ensure greater stability in our earnings but fluctuating market conditions mean that the securities industry can never attain the stability of some other businessesthe markets of the last months of  and the first part of  produced a much less favorable business environment than earlier in  reminding us that our greatest challenge remains managing growth we will be disciplined in our approach but we will continue to build for the future in our business periods of slowing and volatility are to be expected but they do not change our enthusiasm about the medium to long term and in the short term they provide us with an opportunity to strengthen our competitive position the untimely death of michael mortara in november was a loss to the firm and to all of us who had the privilege of working with him mike played an instrumental role in the creation of the mortgagebacked securities market in the s as cohead of our ficc division from  to  and from may  president and ceo of gs ventures the firms financial services incubator mike was one of the most respected and beloved members of the goldman sachs family looking ahead the changes sweeping todays economy  globalization deregulation consolidation technological transformation and pension reform  are creating a business environment of great opportunities by virtue of the firms global presence unparalleled reputation and extraordinary people goldman sachs is well positioned to seize those opportunities on behalf of our shareholders we are absolutely committed to doing so in  and beyond,3.067,1.0
2,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2001,it is impossible to discuss  without beginning with the events of september  while our  people in the downtown new york area were unharmed and our facilities largely untouched the stunning and savage attack on the world trade center just a few blocks away from our headquarters represented a formidable challenge in operational and human terms we are proud to report that the people of goldman sachs not just in new york but around the world met this challenge with courage resilience and initiative but even as our people worked tirelessly to keep goldman sachs up and running they never forgot the human dimension of the september  tragedy they reached out to provide comfort to those who had lost loved ones and friends in the attack and together with the firm they provided needed material assistance in the form of more than  million in donations for the victims of this crime in short september  tested us as a firm and as individuals in a way we had never been tested and we emerged stronger than ever before our corporate culture had again proven its enduring value this years report focuses on the business principles and the core values that embody our culture commitment to the client teamwork integrity professional excellence and entrepreneurial spirit these values not only serve our clients and shareholders they also set us apart from other firms making us the employer of choice in our industry our culture of teamwork allows us to pull together the best thinking from different parts of the firm and deliver integrated solutions to complex client problems our emphasis on integrity makes us a firm that individuals corporations institutions and governments can trust our commitment to professional excellence and a true meritocracy ensures that our clients receive the very best service that our industry can offer our focus on entrepreneurship means that we are always searching for new ways to promote our customers interests maintaining the goldman sachs culture is therefore a critical task but it is not easy like any competitive edge our cul ture must be continually reinforced and adapted or it will atrophy though some were concerned that our decision to go public in  would undermine our core values we disagreed we believe that our culture reflects much more than our ownership structure instead it is the manifestation of the values that have been impressed upon us for yearsconstantly communicated from the top downand the behavior and actions that are reinforced through our degree performance reviews and rewarded through promotions compensation and peer approval our initial public offering in fact enhanced our culture by spreading ownershipand a personal stake in our successthroughout the firm but our culture does face a challenge our grow ing size it is far easier to inculcate and perpetuate core values in an organization of  people than it is in one of over  the major task confronting us todayas it did in  and will for the foreseeable futureis managing growth in the financial services industry where people are absolutely critical size can become the enemy of excellence it is our job to make sure that this does not happen at goldman sachs where our culture is a magnet for talent this is because we offer outstanding peoplehigh achieversthe opportunity to work with other outstand ing people as part of a mutually support ive team in a collaborative environment our people are motivated by job content which has never been more interesting and by working in a meritocracy where they are tested with great responsibility they demand career development oppor tunities and care deeply about the values that goldman sachs represents our people want to make a difference they see globalization as a force for good and are proud of the dynamic role that goldman sachs plays in shaping the world economy it is no easy task to maintain our culture in the face of great growth and change to meet this challenge in  we initiated a multiyear process to adapt our culture to a large and growing global organization without becoming bureaucratic as we became larger we recognized that many of our processesrecruiting mentoring training performance evaluation career developmenthad to be reengineered in the old days each business manager was his or her own human resources professional and much of the training and career development was done on an apprenticeship basis this doesnt work quite as well anymore over the last several years we have made somereal progress in adapting our people management capabilities to a larger organization in pine street named after the address of the original goldman sachs headquarters we are  months into a highly promising leadership development program for our managing directors headed by the former director of the ge crotonville executive educational program we are doing a better job of continually communicating with our people on firmwide divisional and businessunit levels we have continued to strengthen our perfor mance evaluations mentoring and training programs throughout the firm we have recently taken actions to intensify and strengthen a st century diversity program in the context of a global institution we continue to expand our community teamworks program this year over  of our people around the world worked together in teams to give energy and creativity to nonprofit organizations in the communities in which they work these and other measures to manage our growth are ongoing they are clearly only part of what must be a longterm broad based commitment to strengthening our culture makingand keepingthat commitment will be critical as we work toward our goal of becoming the worlds preeminent investment banking securities and investment management company of course we recognize that a corporate culture is not an end in itself but a means to an end it enables us to execute suc cessfully a winning business strategy that results in extraordinary client service and superior longterm financial performance for our shareholders like everyone in our industry we faced considerable adversity in the form of difficult market conditions in  we have noted in the past that we do not expect a predictable stable pattern of quarteroverquarter earnings increases in fact while we believe our business offers attractive long term returns  provided an excellent reminder that fluctuating markets mean that our business will never have the stability of some other sectors we continually tell our people that although we cannot do anything to change the environment we can strive to outperform the competition and meet the high expectations of our clients from that perspective  was a highly successful year the quality of our people and culture together with the strength and diversity of our businesses was evident as we produced an  return on our tangible shareholders equity in one of the most challenging years in our industrys historyinvestment banking activity and revenues declined sharply for the industry our own results were no exception the firms performance in this challenging environ ment was however firstrate we believe the quality of our client relationships and our leadership in the most important businesses have never been stronger for example in  we again were the number one advisor in merger transac tions on a worldwide basis we advised on  of the  largest transactions com pleted during the year more than any other firm we also were the number one global underwriter of initial public offerings and all common stock offerings we think these results are a testament to the strength and quality of our franchise within our trading and principal investments business fixed income currency and commodities produced excellent results increasing net revenues  by capitalizing on lower interest rates increased volatility and strong cus tomer demand performance was strong across a wide range of our businesses including commodities currencies our creditsensitive businesses and fixed income derivatives net revenues declined in our equities business in a difficult environment with declining volatility and customer flow despite the challenging market we were very pleased with our progress in the integration of spear leeds  kellogg with our own capabilities to strengthen our leading position in equities markets principal investments had a very disap pointing year with significant mark tomarket losses principally in our high technology and telecommunications investments overall however we con tinue to believe that our merchant bank ing activities are an excellent business for us we see many attractive opportunities created by the volatility in the past year asset management and securities services produced another record year in  assets under management increased  to  billion in  we had record net inflows of  billion of new client assets these very strong results demonstrate the value created through a diverse multiproduct global platform we also continue to build our highnetworth business and believe it is one of our most attractive growth opportunities as our industry has undergone dramatic consolidation over the last few years and as commercial banks have increas ingly used lowpriced credit as a competi tive tool some observers have asked is goldman sachs big enough to be frank we believe that this is the wrong question particularly for a global firm with over  people  billion in equity capital and a  billion balance sheet capital has never been a limiting factor for us the right question  and the one we ask ourselves constantly  is can we con tinue to manage growth by adapting our culture to a large and increasingly com plex global company this and not the size of competitors will be the key to our continuing ability to execute our strategy superbly which is the ultimate determi nant of our success we face a big challenge but we are up to it we wouldnt trade places with any of our competitors whatever their size or business model despite the uncertainties of the current market envi ronment we remain bullish about the future we operate at the sweet spot of global capitalism we believe that the trends that have created opportunities for us in the past globalization deregulation consolidation and marketdriven reformwill continue to do so in the future but we know that our ultimate success will depend upon a constant commitment to the core cultural values that allow us to execute success fully our corporate strategy and to attract the very best of the best in the world of finance we have made that commitment and intend to adhere resolutely to it in  and the years that follow we owe you our shareholders no less,2.31,0.0
3,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2002,it was a challenging year for goldman sachs the business environment was perhaps the most difficult in recent history marked by weak or negative growth throughout much of the world international uncertainty the third consecutive year of broad equities market declines and the continued aftermath of the technologytelecom munications bubble collapse as a firm we cannot control the external forces that shape the business climate what we can control is how we manage our business and execute our strategy on those terms goldman sachs  results demonstrated the firms resilience and ability to produce a solid perform ance for shareholders net earnings for the year were  billion on total net revenues of  billion earnings per diluted share were  down  from  return on shareholders equity was  for the year and return on tangible shareholders equity was  evident in this performance were both the strength and diversity of the goldman sachs franchise and our discipline concerning expense reduction this performance also reflected as it has throughout the  years since the firms founding in good times and bad the quality of the people of goldman sachs and their ability to develop and execute business investment banking activity and net revenues for the industry declined throughout the year those declines are clearly seen in our investment banking results although relative performance remained strong once again goldman sachs ranked first in announced and completed global mergers and acquisitions and we advised on seven of the ten largest deals completed during  we were also the leading underwriter of global public equity offerings in  and ranked second in global initial public offerings within our trading and principal investments business fixed income currency and commodities ficc produced record net revenues for the firm demonstrating the ability to serve clients and take risk prudently in particular we were able to avoid significant credit losses as the business environment deteriorated and spreads widened performance was strong across most of our ficc businesses particularly in currencies mortgages and fixed income derivatives net revenues declined in our equities trading business reflecting weaknesses in global equities markets in what continues to be a very difficult environment at the same time however we continued to strengthen our equities franchise in the most important trading centers across the globe and as a result of the fuller integration of spear leeds  kellogg we are truly at the cutting edge of technologydriven innovation and efficiency principal investments had another disappointing year with further declines in the value of several technology and telecom investments more than offsetting favorable results from the real estate portfolio during the year however we were successful at finding a number of very attractive investments in which to participate and we continue to believe this is a particularly good time to be an active investor asset management and securities services continued its strong performance in  despite significant equities market depreciation assets under management declined only slightly reflect ing net inflows this is we believe an affirmation of our investment track record as well as our focus on client servicein response to the difficult operating environment we reduced operating expenses by  from the prior years level noncompensation expenses were pared back and we made painful but necessary reductions to our workforce taking great care not to impair our ability to compete today or in the future compensation is of course our largest expense and we imposed rigorous discipline in making  bonus awards most professionals saw reductions in total compensation starting with the firms senior management finally we took important steps throughout  to refocus the entire goldman sachs organi zation on our business principles which begin and end with an absolute insistence on integrity in particular we have a major continuing initiative aimed toward insuring that we exhibit unimpeach able professionalism in everything we do and reinforcing our culture that culture with its emphasis on client service teamwork strict compliance and excellence is our greatest strength but it requires constant reinforcement particularly in difficult markets and under adverse conditions safeguarding our culture will continue to be one of our highest priorities in  the continuing aftereffects of the late s technologytelecommunications bubble posed significant challenges to the financial markets and our industry in  the huge losses associated with the bubbles collapse severely affected investor confidencewhich in turn was further shaken by the large and highly visible corporate scandals that emerged beginning in late  all this led to a storm of public criticism and calls for new laws and regulations notwithstanding some of the rhetoric much of the criticism has been warranted as are many of the regulations recently enacted or proposed and while it is simply wrong to say that investment banks such as goldman sachs created the market bubble it is true that in common with much of the media academia and the business community we misjudged it the more important point at least for us at goldman sachs is that we understand and accept our responsibilities as one of the gatekeepers of the financial markets with the benefit of hindsight it is clear that we all could have done better we are committed to learning from our mistakes against this backdrop in  there were dramatic changes in the legal and regulatory environment the new york stock exchange proposed new corporate governance listing rules us regulators mandated ceo and cfo certification of corporate financial statements law enforcement agencies began aggressive enforcement actions aimed at misconduct and the us congress passed the sarbanesoxley act in an attempt to strengthen confidence in us corporations accounting and financial markets in the financial services industry public scrutiny focused on the role and quality of investment research even before the public controversy of  arose we had taken a series of decisive steps commencing in february to protect further the integrity of our research and to improve its quality during the months that followed we worked closely with regulators and other investment banks in crafting the provisional settlement announced on december  while many of the new rules were initiated primarily to protect retail investors  not our market segmentwe are determined to make them work in addition we are supportive of a proposed industry initiative that generally would prohibit allocations of initial public offerings to officers and directors of public companies the new rules for research and for ipo allocations applicable in the us may well form a template for our industry throughout the world we have also attempted to play a positive role in the debate on corporate governance accounting and regulatory reform and among other things participated in the development of the sarbanes oxley act in the united states as with the research settlement there are areas of the sarbanesoxley act that need to be clarified to prevent unintended consequences to the competitiveness of the us capital markets at the same time one of the strengths of the us system has always been its ability to respond to crisis with quick selfcorrec tion passage of the sarbanesoxley act was part of that process and we support it as an important step towards rebuilding investor confidence we believe that only by putting appropriate corporate governance mechanisms in place and otherwise aligning the interests of management with shareholders can there be sufficient focus on shareholder interests in that connection we refer you to our statement on promoting and protect ing shareholder interestson february   goldman sachs entered into a series of related transactions with sumitomo mitsui financial group inc smfg that include an investment of  billion  billion in convertible preferred stock of smfg the provision by smfg of credit loss protection to goldman sachs and a broadening of cooperative initiatives between our two firms we believe these transac tions have strategic significance and real benefit to both organizations and their shareholders for goldman sachs it enables us to pursue three important objectives first it deepens our participa tion in japan and japanese financial markets through an investment in one of that nations largest and bestmanaged institutions second the credit protection component will enhance goldman sachs ability to offer credit commitments to invest mentgrade clients while mitigating in part the credit risk of doing so finally the agreement with smfg extends the range of cooperative initiatives between goldman sachs and smfg and areason which we anticipate working together will include the disposition of nonperforming assets investment banking and asset management this transaction is especially meaningful given the long and successful relationship between our firms including sumitomo banks historic capital invest ment of  million in goldman sachs initiated in  in december we announced that william george former chairman and ceo of medtronic inc was joining our board of directors bill fills the seat steve friedman left when he retired to become assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the national economic council we will miss steves contributions to the board although we are gratified that president bush will have the benefit of his counsel and we are fortunate to gain a new director of bills caliber morris chang and meg whitman also resigned as directors late in  we are grateful for their dedication and insights as directors in february  in light of the announced retirement of bob hurst the board nominated lloyd blankfein a vice chairman of goldman sachs with responsi bility for our securities businesses to stand for election to our board of directors at the april  annual meeting we look forward to having lloyd as a new director and we thank bob for his contributions to our board over the past year we changed the ranks of our senior leadership to meet the challenging business environment and to ensure the best possible service to our clients lloyd blankfein bob steel and rob kaplan were appointed vice chairmen and asked to take on expanded man agement responsibilities in addition masanori mochida suzanne nora johnson john weinberg gary cohn chris cole michael evans scott kapnick peter kraus eric mindich tom montag eric schwartz michael sherwood and andrew melnick joined the firms management committee over the course of  these individuals bring a wealth of talent and experience and a diversity of perspectives to the committee one of the most meaningful tests of individuals and organizations is how well they handle adver sity in  the people of goldman sachs rose to meet the challenges of the environment and events with great distinction and considerable success we anticipate that the coming year will con tinue to be difficult with slow growth in most of our major markets the international situation particularly in the middle east and asia is of concern to us all and will affect market conditions in ways that cannot be predicted and we believe that close scrutiny of the securities industry and its role in the late s bubble will continue however there is no question that today goldman sachs is a stronger firm than we were only a year ago and well positioned to benefit from the broad secular forces that despite recent setbacks are driving profound and lasting global change as a result we have even greater confi dence in goldman sachs longerterm prospects and success,2.114,0.0
4,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2003,looking back on  we take pride in our performance during a very challenging year net earnings in  were  billion a  increase from  earnings per diluted share eps were  a  increase from  and our second highest reported eps as a public company our  return on average shareholders equity was  up from  in  our return on average tangible shareholders equity was  well above the  earned in  by its nature our business doesnt lend itself to predictable recurring earnings as we often remind our people goldman sachs cannot control the market environment in which we work but we can control our relative performance by this standard we judge  to be a success and further evidence of the strength and resilience of our franchise despite our success in  most of us will remember the past year as one in which we faced the continuing fallout from the collapse of the hightech bubble and the series of corporate scandals that followed it was an environment marked by sharp criticism and intense scrutiny of corporations generally and financial services firms in particular  at goldman sachs we continue to experience enhanced regulatory scrutiny in all areas of our business while at times not without challenges we see this as an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and those of others as we strive to do all we can to restore investor confidence to improve the structure and practices of financial markets and above all to strengthen our own policies and procedures our highest priority is to enhance our reputation for integrity in everything we do it is a challenging agenda and the implications are farreaching success will to a large degree be measured by the extent to which financial institutions like goldman sachs can continue to operate effectively this is important because the role played by integrated investment bankswhich bring together the providers and users of capitalis central to wellfunctioning capital markets and to sustained global growth firms like ours are in many ways agents of change we facilitate entrepreneurship and innovation help create opportunities for individuals and companies alike and act as a catalyst for economic reform around the world this year our letter is a little longer than usual because we address in more detail some of the most important opportunities and issues we face as a firm investment banking activity continued to suffer from diminished corporate and investor confidence in a tough business environment industry volumes for completed mergers decreased again in  and equity underwriting volumes remained low global completed mergers decreased  from  and were  below volumes in  the prior peak our results reflected this difficult industry environment investment banking net revenues were  billion down  from  and pretax earnings were  million down from  million the year before however despite this difficult environment we maintained our focus on serving clients and continued as the market leader in our core franchise businesses including mergers and acquisitions and ipo equity and equitylinked underwriting in addition we developed a prominent position in the issuance of highyield securities we think the strength of our franchise and the quality of our client relationships are evident in this performance we do not however seek to be number one in all areas pursuing market share in some products makes no sense to us when the profitability is too small or nonexistent we believe that our role as a core advisor to clients has never been stronger our investment banking professionals continue to play a vital role in advising senior executives and a broad range of clients throughout the world through these relationships our people are able to identify the needs of our clients and offer solutions by providing advice products and services from across our firm once again in  trading and principal investments produced excellent results net revenues were  billion a  increase from  pretax earnings were  billion a  increase from  we measure the effectiveness of our trading businesses by evaluating overall profitability relative to the risk we assume and the opportunities available while there is no perfect measure of market risk a topic well discuss later in this letter our risk levels were higher in  than in  we were very pleased with the results our businesses were able to produce by effectively deploying incremental capital fixed income currency and commodities ficc had another record year with net revenues of  billion a  increase from  during  ficc operated in a generally favorable environment characterized by tightening corporate credit spreads low interest rates a steep yield curve and strong customer demand as we look forward to  we do not see clear signs that ficc activity levels will slow however we know that there is no such thing as a trading backlog and our business opportunities will always depend on the overall environment one important aspect of our ficc business that is often overlooked is the range and diversity of activities it comprises within the five major areas of ficcinterest rates credit mortgages currencies and commoditiesare a wide range of individual operations around the globe while there can be no guarantee about performance in any of our businesses we believe that this diversity is an important strength our equities business continued to face a very challenging environment equities net revenues of  billion increased  compared with  primarily due to higher net revenues in principal strategies while equity markets certainly improved in  relative to the previous few years conditions remained tough commission rates and spreads have continued to decline the need to commit capital in a variety of circumstances is rising and volume growth is low at goldman sachs we have focused on the optimal size and structure for our equities business in this difficult environment we are pleased with the results of this effort which we believe will be an important driver of future performance beginning with the appointment in  of common management for our securities businesses we have been more closely coordinating the activities of our ficc and equities businesses to share best practices capture synergies and drive efficiencies in  we continued this work combining our equities cash and derivatives client businesses under one leadership team this builds on the experience of a similar combination in ficc in  and will position us well to capture a range of opportunities research remains a critically important part of the goldman sachs franchise we believe that a strong differentiated research effort that is firmly aligned with the interests of our investing clients will be an important part of our equities business for many years to come of course  began with the brokerage industrys global settlement with various regulators on equities researchrelated matters as we have said before in hindsight we and others could have done a better job however we had already begun implementing changes in our research business long before the final settlement and we have been working diligently to comply in every respect with the new ground rules we will continue to shape our research so that the qualities our clients value mostindustry expertise independent thinking and timely insightsare at the forefront of our proposition to investors our slk stock specialist business as well as the other specialists on the new york stock exchange nyse have been and continue to be the subject of an intense regulatory review and enforcement action much attention has focused on the conduct of specialists within the existing nyse rules as well as potential changes to the rules governing the role of specialists the role of the specialist and the rules of the nyse should be evaluated against the proper objectivethe development of the best market structure for all participants in our view the market structure of the future can take any number of forms but the goal should be to produce a system that is fair to all investors and one where liquidity is maximized and investors can prioritize price speed and cost of execution we have in the past stated that we are not wedded to any particular market structure goldman sachs is active and successful in markets around the world many of which make greater use of electronic interfaces than the nyse in fact we have invested in a number of electronic trading platforms we believe however that the specialist performs a valuable role in maintaining an orderly market particularly during times of market stress or when there are imbalances or dislocations with regard to a single stock this system has helped to maintain the nyse as the leading equities exchange in the world we also believe investors are best served by large liquidity pools and greater use of electronic structures by centralizing rather than fragmenting liquidity investors will achieve the best possible outcomes at this point we are unable to predict the outcome of the regulatory review or the impact of potential reforms we can assure you however that we will continue to cooperate fully with the regulators and to assist them in every way we can to develop the best equities market possible whatever changes are adopted we feel confident in our ability to compete successfully across our equities franchise which remains an industry leader it is often reported in the media that we have increased our trading risk in recent years to offset the decline in investment banking activity levels in fact the same shocks and trends in the economy that have led to the sharp declines in investment banking have also created significant trading opportunities for our clients and for goldman sachs we believe our willingness to take significant trading risk for appropriate reward is one of the distinguishing features of our firm and gives us a competitive advantage we benefit in the marketplace because our clientsmany of whom are among the worlds largest and most sophisticated institutionsvalue our ability to tailor solutions and our willingness to commit our capital to meet their needs given the significant levels of risk we run in our business we consider risk management to be one of our most vital functions risk management begins at the top of the firm with the establishment of risk limits for major business units and the involvement of our most senior people in critical decisions in setting limits there is no magic formula but we do size our risk in proportion to our capital base and our overall earnings power since we went public in  our shareholders equity has grown more than threefold to  billion as of november  one principal tool we use to measure market risk is value at risk var a statistical measure of the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level we use a oneday horizon and a  level of confidence this means that about once a month our actual daily trading revenues should be less than our expected daily trading revenues by an amount at least as large as our var in  our average daily var was  million as important as it is to understand what var is telling you it is important to understand what it is not telling you var in no way captures a worst case scenario shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by a large amount in addition shortfalls can accumulate over a longer period such as a number of consecutive trading days  as a predictor of trading results var historically has worked relatively well in stable markets and less well in very volatile and illiquid markets recognizing this fact we also perform various scenario analyses asking what if about any number of possible events these scenarios are used to establish limits and to attempt to keep our risk manageable no one likes trading losses but they are a feature of our business in fact it is our willingness to tolerate such occasional sizeable losses that enables us to earn attractive returns over time and even when our trading businesses are performing well results can be uneven in  our balance sheet grew reflecting the higher activity levels in our trading and investing businesses and our willingness to deploy our capital to serve clients while we face risks across every aspect of our business access to liquidity remains the single most important issue for any financial services firm there are many events that can create problems for a financial institutionmacro events trading losses reputational damages to name a fewbut the most serious is a lack of liquidity as a result we place major emphasis on assuring our access to liquidity the cornerstone of our approach is a cushion we maintain in the form of cash and highly liquid securities that averaged some  billion in  we think of this cushion as liquidity support in the event of unexpected dislocations in financial marketsthe use of derivatives a key part of our trading activity has been the subject of increased debate recently derivatives span a wide rangefrom a simple interest rate swap that allows a company to convert its fixed rate borrowing into a floating rate exposure to more complex instruments like credit derivatives that allow investors to hedge risk associated with credit exposures in their portfolios while derivatives can be misused they are a vital tool for risk management and risk dispersion over the last few years we have witnessed seven of the ten largest corporate bankruptcies ever with surprisingly little dislocation in global credit markets the dispersion of risk permitted by derivatives appears to have contributed very significantly to this outcome moreover those financial institutions that have had some of the greatest problems in recent years were hurt in many cases by large unhedged exposures to equity markets of course the use of derivatives like other financial instruments requires a rigorous handson approach to risk management and control these features were notably absent in some companies whose troubles have been widely publicized at goldman sachs we maintain an independent control function that monitors all of our trading positions and independently verifies their fair value after two disappointing years principal investments produced positive results in  net revenues increased to  million up from negative  million in  the increase was attributable to gains and overrides from real estate and corporate investments including a  million unrealized gain on our investment in sumitomo mitsui financial group smfg we expect the results from this business to be uneven as there is a time lag between investing and harvesting in  we were fortunate to make a number of significant investments and we are optimistic about their return potential we believe we have improved the quality of the portfolio in the last few years and have made some substantial investments that can drive the performance of this business over the cycle we also sold some successful investments during  including part of our holding in kookmin bank in south korea this deal highlights some of the characteristics of our business that we believe stand us in good stead for the future our global reach and relationships our willingness to deploy significant capital swiftly and our ability to take a long view our investment in convertible preferred stock of smfg carries with it significant volatility we hold the investment at fair value which is derived primarily from smfgs common share price since our investment in february  smfgs share price has closed as low as  and as high as  significant changes in smfgs share price produce significant changes in the fair value of our investment which we report as net revenues each quarter our decision to invest in smfg was based on our longterm confidence in japan and the opportunity to strengthen our relationship with one of the most important financial institutions in japan shortterm fluctuations in the value of smfg are not cause for particular concern to us as long as the fundamentals of smfg are steady and improving which we believe to be the caseour asset management and securities services business had an excellent year net revenues were  billion a  increase from  pretax earnings were  million in  compared with  million in  in asset management net revenues were  billion a  increase from  primarily reflecting an increase in average assets under management the contribution from the acquisition of ayco and increased incentive income total assets under management increased  to a record  billion two closely related factors are critical to building our business the ability to generate attractive investment performance and the ability to raise new assets during  our investment performance together with our distribution strength allowed us to generate  billion of net client inflows across nonmoney market asset classes these increases were offset by  billion of outflows in money market assets as economic prospects improved and higher returns were being generated in other asset classes within our securities services business net revenues were  billion up  from  this business continues to benefit from the creation and growth of new and existing hedge funds in addition the rally in equity markets helped to increase customer balances we believe our asset management and securities services business represents one of our best opportunities for substantial growth managing expenses in this challenging environment has been one of our highest priorities during  excluding the impact of acquisitions we reduced our headcount by  while painful these reductions were necessary to scale our operations to the available opportunities and were a key factor in our ability to generate an attractive return in  our largest expensein a people businessis compensation and we track this expense as a percentage of the net revenues we generate in our businesses overall for  the ratio of compensation to net revenues was  versus  in  we remain focused on controlling our noncompensation expenses however there are some areas that remain difficult to forecast for instance in  we took provisions of  million for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings given the range of litigation and investigations underway these expenses may remain high goldman sachs is not a financial services conglomerate but an integrated investment bank securities firm and asset manager this focused strategy has allowed us to build a strong global franchisewe take pride in being a market leader in europe and asia as well as the united states it has also allowed us to benefit from the longterm growth of the global capital markets which we believe will continue to provide us with excellent growth opportunities over the cycle we aspire to be the preeminent global provider of advisory financing investment and risk management services to corporations institutions governments and highnetworth individuals to succeed in this mission the firm has always placed great reliance on attracting and retaining outstanding people and we work hard to foster teamwork and encourage creativity client focus and innovation we believe that our unique culture coupled with the quality of our people is goldman sachs most important competitive strength our business has always been highly competitive and cyclical we face strong competition today as in the past from larger competitors but we dont view our size as a competitive disadvantage because we have never been constrained by a lack of capital we believe our biggest challenge is to strengthen our culture of teamwork and excellence in the face of the growing size and scope of our business we are determined to meet this challenge because we believe our ability to do so is critical to our continued success in executing our global strategy and serving our clients in  we completed a number of strategic transactions our first announcement involved our  billion investment in smfg which we mentioned above we are pleased with the performance of our investment as well as the other aspects of our relationship with smfg with the credit loss protection provided by smfg we initiated our william street credit extension program this capability has given us an innovative way to extend credit selectively to our investmentgrade clients while reducing our credit and liquidity risks by the end of fiscal   billion of credit commitments had been made under the program in addition our business cooperation agreement with smfg has already resulted in a number of initiatives in october we announced the formation of a joint venture to facilitate the corporate recovery of certain smfg borrowing clients and to accelerate smfgs plans to improve its asset quality in september we combined our australian operations with jbwere to create a new venture called goldman sachs jbwere we own  of the new entity one of the leading investment banking and securities firms in australia we also made several acquisitions in  our approach to acquisitions is to strengthen our business and build shareholder value principally through emphasizing bolton deals where we can add new clients or acquire new products to provide to our existing clients  offered us a number of such opportunities in july we acquired the ayco company a leading provider of sophisticated feebased financial counseling in the united states ayco enables us to develop further our highnetworth and asset management businesses by using its extensive portfolio of financial planning capabilities including tax estate and charitable planning services we also made two acquisitions of power generation assets in october we acquired east coast power owner of the megawatt cogeneration facility in linden new jersey which sells some  of its power to the new york city market in the same month we announced the acquisition of cogentrix energy an independent power producer based in charlotte north carolina adding interests in  power plants and  megawatts of generating capacity to our portfolio these generation facilities were acquired to complement our existing commodity trading and merchant energy restructuring capabilities of course ownership of physical power assets brings incremental responsibilities of which we are particularly mindful in june we announced that claes dahlbck nonexecutive chairman of investor ab and edward m liddy chairman of the board president and chief executive officer of the allstate corporation were joining our board of directors claes and ed are both distinguished business leaders as well as thoughtful corporate directors and we welcome the contributions they are already making to the board the board has also nominated lois d juliber chief operating officer of the colgatepalmolive company to stand for election to our board of directors at the march  annual meeting in addition john thain and john thornton retired as directors and we thank them for their service on our board and to our shareholders on balance  proved to be a more favorable operating environment than we expected at the beginning of the year markets rose economic growth improved in most major economies and business confidence rose although we expect these trends to continue in  we cannot of course predict with certainty what global events economic or political in fact will shape the markets in which we work but we cannd willursue a strategy that permits us to seize business opportunities in an environment of continuing uncertainty and possible volatility we owe you our shareholders nothing less in terms of our own industry it is clear that if anything regulatory scrutiny has intensified in the us and in other countries around the world we anticipate that this will continue to be a feature of the environment in which we operate that said we look forward with confidence to  and beyond our franchise is stronger than ever our people remain focused dedicated and enthusiastic we are committed to serving you our shareholders by delivering longterm growth and by producing real value for our clients through products and services that strengthen the global capital markets and support economic growth,3.005,1.0
5,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2004, was an outstanding year for goldman sachsthe strongest performance in the firms history net revenues increased  to a record  billion and net earnings rose  to a record  billion earnings per diluted share eps were  the highest we have ever reported and our return on average tangible shareholders equity was  compared with  in  our success in  can be attributed to many factors and demonstrates the remarkable potential of our firm most importantly our results reflect the strength of our franchise the depth of our client relationships across all of our businesses and our leading positions in the most important financial markets around the world we also benefited from steps taken in earlier more difficult years to restructure certain of our businesses and build for the future  this year like many before it was marked by a number of rapidly shifting markets our ability to navigate these changes and effectively manage our risks strengthened our results as we have remarked before we cannot control the environment but we strive to outperform our peers in all market environments we are particularly pleased that our relative performance was very strong  it is worth noting that we wont always be as fortunate as we were in  but we are energized by the challenge and optimistic about the future our longterm success has deep rootsin our client relationships our willingness to commit capital and to manage risk our global reach our nimbleness and above all our people and reputation it is the combination of these attributes that enabled us to serve our clients and to generate attractive returns for our shareholders in   along with people around the world goldman sachs was stunned by the devastation caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis in south asia in late december  our response was immediate and focused within hours of the disaster the firm was working to ensure that our people in the area were safe within days we had partnered with our contacts in the nonprofit community including care japan red cross society the international rescue committee and americares  to identify the most urgent needs in the regions and to provide assistance to those impacted by the disaster beyond our immediate response goldman sachs remains committed to assisting over the long term through supporting initiatives to rebuild the physical and economic infrastructures of the impacted countries we believe that our business success is accompanied by a responsibility to act and the response of our people to this tragedy underscores the strength of this belief throughout the firm  investment banking activity began to recover during  global completed mergers and acquisitions increased  compared with  and worldwide common stock issuance nearly doubled our net revenues in investment banking increased  to  billion and pretax earnings almost doubled to  million  in  we maintained leadership positions in our most important highmargin businesses in mergers and acquisitions we ranked number one globally in announced and completed activity for the seventh consecutive year and advised on seven of the ten largest completed transactions we also demonstrated the strength of our equity underwriting franchise ranking second in worldwide common stock and initial public offerings with leadership positions in every major region in leveraged finance we continued to strengthen our global business and we have been at the forefront of the growth of the hybrid loan market particularly working with financial sponsor clients in a period in which trading results are more significant than ever to the industrys performance some may under estimate the importance of investment banking we believe it is difficult to overstate the importance of investment banking to our firm our traditional role as an advisor and underwriter will always be a critical part of our business in addition in todays rapidly changing markets corporate clients are increasingly asking us to help them manage their risk by acting as a principal these opportunities are an attractive source of transactions and come from the strength of our relationships and the depth of our market knowledge  to better serve our clients in  we created a global financing group by combining our traditional equity and debt capital markets underwriting areas with our financing and liability hedging businesses through this combination we are able to offer our clients a full range of customized financing and hedging alternatives to meet their needs more effectively early in  the financing group was combined with investment banking bringing together our strategic corporatefacing businesses  delivering the resources of the entire firm to our clients in a seamless fashion with investment banking as front of the house is one of the most challenging things we do it is also one of the most rewarding our ability to serve our clients with firmwide resources is a critical competitive advantage and stems directly from our culture of teamwork  barring unforeseen shocks we expect a continued gradual recovery in the level of investment banking activity capital raising and strategic activity are directly linked to economic growth as well as to ceo and investor confidence while confidence has certainly increased from the lows of a few years ago further increases are needed to produce more robust investment banking results  trading and principal investments once again produced a record performance in  net revenues increased  to  billion and pretax earnings were up  to  billion  fixed income currency and commodities ficc produced a remarkable performance with net revenues of  billion up  from s record throughout  the environment for our ficc businesses changed continually while absolute interest rates remained low the yield curve flattened during the year as the us federal reserve raised shortterm interest rates four times credit spreads ended the year at very tight levels currency markets dormant for much of the year moved dramatically in the fourth quarter as the us dollar declined markedly commodities prices were exceptionally volatile throughout the year prompting record levels of activity by producers and consumers of energy and raw materials  against this backdrop our strong performance under scores the breadth of our customer franchise across ficc each of our major ficc businessesinterest rate products credit products mortgages currencies and commoditiesis large enough to have a meaningful impact on ficcs overall results in any quarter at the same time it is rare for any one of these businesses to be a dominant portion of our total ficc net revenues in a given period coupled with our culture of outstanding client service we believe this strength in breadth has been a critical advantage in recent years and positions us well for the future  as we enter a period of rising interest rates many wonder about the potential effect on our ficc performance our experience is that customer activity is the key driver of ficc  clients are drawn to the market by the desire to hedge to reallocate investments to capture upside or to limit downside today with deep and liquid derivatives markets and a broader client base than ever before the existence of a trend in prices and activity has become as important as the direction of prices these developments coupled with the diversity of our ficc businesses helps to explain why the increase in interest rates in  did not lead to dramatic declines in ficc revenues to be clear this does not mean that risk has been reduced on the contrary our willingness to take and manage risk is more critical than ever to our clients who are the core of our trading franchise turning to our other major trading business equities net revenues grew  in  to  billion our equities products group net revenues increased as a result of higher customer activity in shares and derivatives globally the principal strategies group also recorded higher net revenues compared with  while equity markets increased in the early part of  much of the year was characterized by directionless markets with lower volumes and declining volatility before a pickup in the last weeks of our fiscal year  the equities business continues to face significant challenges including declining commission rates driven by intense competition and our clients focus on managing trans action costs these challenges in turn create new requirements for us for example our clients more frequently ask us to trade for them in a way that guarantees their execution price rather than by having us act as a pure intermediary this can still be excellent business for us but it places demands on our capital and requires us to accept greater risk than we did in the past  in addition the structure of equity markets continues to be in a state of flux with trading rule changes and market reforms being contemplated by a range of regulatory bodies while our success is not tied to any particular equity market structure we will try to determine the optimal outcome for our clients and our shareholders as alternatives are reviewed regardless of the structure of markets our primary goal is to continue to serve our clients and thereby retain our leadership in global equities  while some of these developments are challenging we have been pleased with our performance in equities we believe our strength across the trading business equips us very well to adapt to changes in the way equities are traded as with ficc the size and breadth of our equities franchise is key it includes our sales and trading operation a leading direct market access capability a dominant prime broker our longstanding proprietary trading business and a commitment to providing world class research  in equities we reduced costs during the downturn of  and more importantly restructured our business to address the challenges outlined above we have also worked to match service levels to our clients needs and our own revenue potential this effort has involved some difficult decisions about where we should focus but we believe it is firmly in the interests of our clients and share holders that we concentrate our resources where they will have the most impact  principal investments had strong results in  with net revenues more than doubling to  billion this included a  million unrealized gain on our investment in convertible preferred stock of sumitomo mitsui financial group smfg reflecting a continued economic recovery in japan almost two years after we invested  billion our convertible preferred is now carried at  billion we are very pleased with this investment which was made possible by our strong relationship with smfg developed over many years it is a prime example of our willingness to commit capital to the mutual benefit of our clients and our shareholders our traditional corporate and real estate investing business also performed very well in  generating gains and overrides of  million after the technology and telecom boom of the late s we returned this business to its traditional merchant banking model of investing larger amounts in mature companies this strategy paid off in  as we were able to take advantage of the credit and equity markets recoveries and harvest some of these investments and we continue to identify attractive opportunities to invest our capital in this business  we view principal investing as a vital part of an integrated investment bank our success in this area stems partly from our role as an innovator we helped lead the way in partnering with other private equity investors many of whom are also our clients to supply the capital required for larger deals and to spread risk among a wider investor base we continue to see this strategy as important to our future success and another example of how multiple relationships can be managed for the benefit of our clients  our asset management and securities services businesses had an excellent year net revenues were up  to a record  billion and pretax earnings rose  to a record  billion  in asset management net revenues grew  to a record  billion as assets under management grew and incentive fees for exceeding performance benchmarks set a new record net inflows during  were very strong totaling  billion across all asset classes while market appreciation added  billion as a result yearend assets under management reached a record  billion there is no more direct testament to the performance of our investment strategies than our success in attracting new assets this was an exceptional year overall for asset management with strong asset growth and expanding margins  securities services posted record net revenues of  billion up  from  we continue to benefit from trends in hedge fund formation activity levels and asset flows we have also had success in winning new mandates  despite everincreasing competition securities services isan excellent business which we have built over many years our consistent commitment to highquality service for our clients has made us an industry leader  asset management and securities services continue to offer some of our most attractive opportunities for future growth our total operating expenses increased  in  againsta net revenues increase of  most of our expenses related to compensation and benefits and a majority of that was discretionary yearend compensation based on the performance of the firm and our people compensation and benefits were  of net revenues in  against  in  this reflects our strong performance as well as an increasingly competitive environment for talented people keeping our team together is critically important and more than everwe have worked hard to be fair and appropriate in our compensation decisions we have always approached compensation decisions from the bottom up rather than allocating dollars based on a rigid share of net revenues we try to determine the right amount of compensation for each individuals contribution to the firms performance this takes time and effort but we believe it is repaid in our ability to attract and retain people for the long term without relying on multiyear bonus guarantees headcount grew for the first time in several years during  up  to  noncompensation expenses were  billion up  compared with  most of the yearoveryear increase came from higher levels of business activity and higher professional fees looking forward we want to emphasize that while expenses will inevitably increase in a stronger business and economic environment we continue to focus hard on controlling discretionary costs that said we have little control over the escalating costs related to increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny of our industry as well as litigation in addition to provisions for legal and regulatory proceedings which amounted to  million in  we continue to incur legal fees associated with such matters as well as expenses related to compliance with new legislative and regulatory requirements and investigations these costs include not only the direct expense of new internal processes and additional people but also a significant investment of senior management time and focus we touched earlier on the importance of combining a strong customer franchise with a willingness to commit capital on behalf of our clients we believe that this has been  and will continue to be  critical to our success across our many businesses our client franchise is second to none at the same time our trading and risk management is best in class critically we believe that we combine these attributes as well as or better than any other firm of course committing capital requires us to take risk we believe our willingness to take meaningful risk for appropriate reward is one of the distinguishing features of our firm it is what places risk management at the center of our core competencies one measure of our market risktaking is valueatrisk var a statistical measure of potential loss in the value of our trading positions over a defined time horizon with a specified level of confidence in  our average daily var was  million  higher than the  million average in  during the year the components of var which include risks related to interest rates equity prices currencies and commodities varied significantly this illustrates the extent to which we dynamically allocate risk capital to take advantage of perceived opportunities as we have said before var is only one risk management tool it does not capture worst case outcomes and we continue to use scenario analyses stress testing and other analytical tools as key components of our risk management discipline in addition we constantly analyze imbalances in global markets which may affect our clients and our firm for example in the past year many have commented on unprecedented global liquidity narrow credit spreads and the rapid pace of hedge fund formation we monitor these risks carefully although we believe that hedge funds and credit products as asset classes will continue to grow over time competition in our businesses continues to be intense a few years ago many thought that there would be significant consolidation in our industry with weaker players being acquired by larger firms trying to enter the investment banking and securities business instead large and wellfunded competitors have been growing their presence organically adding to excess capacity in many areas notwithstanding their efforts we are pleased with our competitive strength and breadth across our core businesses  many of our competitors are much larger and conduct a wider range of businesses than we do we do not view the size of our firm as a disadvantage because we have never been constrained by a lack of capital furthermore in most of the businesses in which we compete we are at least as large as any other competitor we view our focus as an advantage that helps us attract highquality people who share our culture of teamwork and serving our clients through excellence we believe that the experience of the last few years supports our judgment that size and diversification by themselves are not the universal advantages that many have believed them to be in our view many of the synergies sought in the combination of disparate businesses are difficult to achieve just as important managing and controlling a wide array of global businesses is likely to prove even more challenging in an environment of increasing regulatory scrutiny we think our focused business model has served us well and that was particularly evident in our performance relative to our key competitors in   our greatest challenge is to continue to execute to the highest standard as we grow larger as always the most important factor will be our ability to recruit and retain talented people and preserve our distinctive culture of teamwork in this effort we face competition both from traditional firms and from private pools of capital such as hedge funds and private equity businesses but in a challenging environment we are pleased with our success in keeping our team together we believe that our partnership culture has played a vital role in maintaining our position as an employer of choice in our industry the financial services industry continues to be subject to intense regulatory scrutiny contrary to what many had predicted and some may still think the scope of this scrutiny has continued unabated in the last year we accept this scrutiny as an ongoing part of our business and are working very hard to maintain the highest standards in our business practices  one significant part of our response was the establishment of the firms business practices committee more than a year ago the business practices committee which evolved from our global compliance and control committee is part of our continuing effort to reinforce the firms culture of integrity and our commitment to excellence in compliance and reputational judgment in addition to oversight of compliance and operational risks the committee reviews the firms policies and procedures for consistency with our business principles as well as regulatory requirements the committees oversight is intended to mitigate potential risks and to ensure full adherence to our business principles some of the firms most senior leaders are members of the committee including our president vice chairs and other managing directors md engaged in our core businesses and risk management functions at goldman sachs we have always considered our assets to be our people our capital and our reputation the last being the most difficult to restore if ever lost when we look back to the late s we wish that we had differentiated ourselves more positively than we did while we cannot remedy past errors of judgment we know that we must learn from them over the last three years we have implemented a firmwide program of compliance and reputational judgment training to reinforce our compliance culture in  as part of our continuing efforts we will be hosting a chairmans forum which will include every md of the firm this will involve us in more than  meetings with small groups of our mds at which we will discuss at length business practices reputational judgment and compliance leadership we will emphasize to all our mds that our highest priority is to enhance our reputation for integrity in every aspect of our business  business conflicts continue to be a particularly important area of focus for us how we identify disclose and manage real and apparent conflicts of interest will be critical tothe longterm success of our business we operate with the knowledge that what many may have considered acceptable  industry practice yesterday will be the target of intense scrutiny tomorrow we must conduct ourselves accordingly and ensure that we have thoroughly and thoughtfully analyzed all of our business priorities at the same timeit is naive to think that we can operate without conflicts they are embedded in our role as a valued intermediary  between providers and users of capital and those who want to shed risk versus those who are willing to assume it like every industry ours faces conflicting interests and the relevant question must be how do we effectively manage themwe will continue to devote substantial effort and resources to this important issue we must also stay focused on the growth and develop ment of our business we firmly believe that the integrated investment bank intermediating capital flows and providing advice to clients has a central role to play in the efficient functioning of capital markets which in turn is vital to sustained longterm global growth  goldman sachs is not a financial services conglomerate but an integrated investment bank securities firm and asset manager although we analyze many potential transactions we remain focused on finding ways to grow that are consistent with and complementary to this basic strategy during  we completed some important strategic transactions  asia is a region of great opportunity and china has been a strategic priority for our firm for many years in december we announced that we had received official approval to establish a joint venture investment banking and securities firm in china this was the culmination of a significant long term effort to obtain a domestic license in this critical market we are already a leader in providing advisory services to some of chinas most important companies and bringing them to the international capital markets goldman sachs gao hua securities company limited will enable us for the first time to offer a wide range of investment banking and securities trading services to chinese clients in their domestic market specifically the joint venture will be able to underwrite locally listed a share transactions and renminbidenominated corporate bonds and convertible bonds as well as offer domestic advisory services and undertake other investment banking activities the establishment of goldman sachs gao hua securities is a crucial step in the development of our business in one of the worlds most important economies in september  we agreed to acquire interests in  power plants in six us states for approximately  million from our earlier acquisition of cogentrix energy we already had ownership interests in nine of the  plants with its closing on january   this transaction continues our strategy of acquiring what we believe to be attractively priced power assets to complement our existing commodity trading and merchant energy restructuring capabilities  lois d juliber a vice chairman of the colgatepalmolive company was elected to the board of directors at the  annual meeting of shareholders lois has played a central role in extending colgates business to over  countries we are fortunate to benefit from her international depth and experience in addition on november   we were pleased to announce that suzanne m nora johnson was appointed a vice chairman of the firm suzannes career at goldman sachs has spanned nearly  years she will continue to head our global investment research division and to lead our efforts with the new global markets institute  our leadership team was also enhanced by the february  appointment of alan m cohen formerly a partner in the law firm of omelveny  myers llp as global head of compliance alans extensive experience in private practice and his tenure as an assistant us attorney position him well to lead this critically important area of the firm  at the end of  we expanded our senior leadership by selecting  new partners of the firm and  new mds they are a superb new generation of leaders who we believe will help to ensure the continued success of goldman sachs  as we begin  we continue to see significant potential across the firm investment banking activity appears to be recovering gradually equity markets have improved from the summer of  and the environment across our ficc businesses remains broadly favorable in managing the firm we remain focused on our clients and our people are as dedicated and enthusiastic as ever we believe the people of goldman sachs are second to none in the industry  as we look ahead the cornerstones of our business are unchangedserving our clients needs capitalizing on market opportunities as they emerge and harnessing the entrepreneurial talents of our people ,4.553,1.0
6,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2005,fellow shareholders this past year was a successful one for goldman sachs reflecting both a robust market environment and strong performance across all of our major businesses for  net revenues increased  to  billion and net earnings rose  to  billion earnings per diluted common share eps were up  our return on average tangible common shareholders equity was  book value per common share has grown from  at the end of our first year as a public company in  to  at our fiscal yearend on november   an annually com pounded rate of  over this period although goldman sachs cannot control the business environment in which we operate and we fully expect to encounter far more difficult years than  we are responsible for how well we identify and capitalize on the opportunities potentially available to us our ability to do this is dependent on the longterm strength of our franchise that strength is rooted in deep client relation ships market knowledge risk management expertise and leading positions in the most important financial markets around the world these attributes have allowed us to grow our net revenues at an annually compounded rate of nearly twice the rate of global gdp growthsince  structural developments in financial markets and evolving client needs in this years letter we want to discuss the broad structural trends that are driving financial markets and how goldman sachs by leveraging the skills and market knowledge of our people is responding to these trends to best meet the needs of our clients and by extension provide value to our shareholders the global integration of economies and markets it is easy to get lost in abstraction when discussing capital markets but the global integration of economies and markets holds the promise of a more prosperous and secure world we are convinced of the power of globalization to effect positive change by promoting growth creating jobs fostering competition and encouraging reform as such we consider it appropriate to speak about broad issues related to international trade investment and economic reform in developed and less developed countries still the competition for capital resources and labor can be a wrenching process while it is important not to minimize the cost of dislocation increasing global financial integration can channel savings into projects that will maximize global economic growth this will provide governments investors and society more broadly the means to meet their future liabilities given the aging populations in western europe japan and the united states these needs become more pressing each day one clear consequence of economic and financial integration is the rise of global competition for capital investors are able to allocate their capital far more directly than in previous decades they are less interested in the particular market on which a company is listed and instead are more focused on the fundamentals of the environments in which the company operates and onits performance relative to global peers we believe that global capital markets will play a vital role as countries pursue marketbased reform for instance as china transforms itself from a manufacturer of lowcost goods to a higher valueadded producer it will need the capital allocation that deep liquid financial markets can provide over the last  years economic growth in china and india has begun to lift hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty capital flows have increased significantly as investors around the world have sought to participate in this growth in japan reform seems to be lifting the economy out of its lengthy stagnation attracting increasing levels of foreign capitalas investors respond to signs of a recovery and growing domestic demand dynamic growth in china and india the economic renaissance in japan and encouraging indications of a recovery in the german economy are among the focal points for global capital flows and they offer attractive opportunities for global investment banks price discovery as a commodity as global economic integration  and the technological advances that help fuel it  continue to reshape markets the role of financial intermediaries has evolved not so long ago investment banks were paid by clients to estab lish or determine the prevailing bid or ask price for a stock bond or other financial instrument the advent of electronic execution and price display systems providing instantaneous access to market data has reduced execution costs and increased trading volumes this has permitted us to substitute technology for human capital in markets where price discovery has become commoditized while creating opportunities to offer both highvolume commodity like securities trades and more sophisticated and higher valueadded services advice across the capital spectrum investment banks still provide valueadded judgments on the pricing of securities such as new issues or when large positions or other liquidity restraints are involved more frequently however we are asked for our advice in the design origination pricing and use of securities which might impact a companys overall capital structure or help clients better manage their assets and liabilities these instruments most notably derivatives have improved the ability of market participants to manage disperse and target risk consequently companies are able to think more broadly about their entire capital structure and investors have additional tools to help manage the risk in their portfolios with more varied solutions available we believe sound advice and market judgment are particu larly important for corporate issuers and investors private pools of capital the development of new sophisticated financial instruments has coincided with the proliferation and rapid growthof assets under management of private equity and hedge funds because hedge funds are not bound by the restrictions of the investment company act of  they can use strategies and instruments that longonly mutual funds cannot in doing so they seek to mitigate risk while optimizing market returns while many of the more than  hedge funds today will over time likely fail to generate the performance they expect and may ultimately go out of business we believe the industry led by superior investment organizations will continue to growthough at a slower rate  consolidate and evolve for investors the need to generate higher returns while diversifying risk makes hedge funds a permanent fixture on the investment land scape although the approximately  trillion managed by hedge funds represents a small portion of total assets under management globally their influence is dispropor tionate to their size they provide significant levels of liquidity and as a result influence prices for securities across virtually all markets although an increasing number of hedge funds are participating in private equitystyle investments providing bridge loans or other types of financing or engaging in real estate transactions we believe that private equity firms will continue to play a distinctive and significant role in buying and selling companies today capital invested in private equity has surpassed  trillion and in  ten firms had either raised or were in the process of raising individual funds of more than  billion we expect this trend to continue the amount of capital raised and private equity firms ability to deploy that capital is likely to increase financial sponsors share of total mergers and acquisitions activity over time commitment of capital another key trend is the increasing demand from clients for investment banks to combine capital and advice in other words investment banks are expected to commit more of their own capital when executing transactions this can mean hedging a corporate clients exposure to currency fluctuation in a crossborder acquisition guaranteeing an execution price to a client selling a large block of debt or equity or providing the financing for a corporate client involved in a leveraged buyout investment banks are increasingly using their own balance sheets to extend credit to clients to assume market risk on their behalf and sometimes to coinvest alongside them our business we believe that a differentiating strength of goldman sachs is our nimbleness in adapting to changing market trends in order to meet the needs of our clients we are a clientdriven firm and because of this we remind ourselves continually that we are only as good as our clients think we are investment banking one important manifestation of our commitment to serving our clients is the quality and global breadth of our corporate investment banking franchise in our corporate advisory business our global preeminence in mergers and acquisitions is a direct result of the creativity knowledge and client focus of our people their value is evidenced each day in the strategic advice we provide to companies  practical wellinformed advice grounded in the breadth and depth of our knowledge of and participation in financial markets around the world through our leading position in the market as an underwriter of a companys debt or equity instruments we help clients raise capital to build new businesses or strengthen existing ones in the process we commit our capital to help our clients meet their financing needs on the most attractive terms available investment banking serves as the main initial point of contact with all of goldman sachs for our clients to find creative and comprehensive solutions to complex problems integrating advice and capital our sales and trading activities are sometimes thought to be divorced from our client businesses the reality is quite different as the capital markets have evolved creating an increasingly greater nexus between capital and advice so has the role of financial intermediary today we provide integrated solutions that help our clients to manage disperse reduce or aggregate risk in order to achieve their objectiveswe serve a broad array of corporate government institutional and highnet worth clients around the world an important reason these clients come to goldman sachs is that we arewell suited to integrate strategic advice market knowledge risk management expertise and financing and trading skills our culture of teamwork strengthens our position as the advisor financier coinvestor and financial intermediary of choice securities sales and trading our securities sales and trading businesses include dozens of distinct areas from equity products and currency options to structured credit and energy futuresand each of these businesses has many subbusinesses around the world they allow us to provide our investing and corporate invest ment banking clients with liquidity capital market access and knowledge as well as risk management expertise in the securities markets the needs of our investing clients and the volatility of markets do not always present a simple choice between assuming and avoiding risk certainly a significant portion of our business occurs when we act as agent we do so for example through our strong market position in electronically executing equities transactions today more than  organizations around the world use our rediplus direct market access system and our algorithmic execution tools in aggregate we trade some  million shares per day on an agency basis through these electronic execution channels offering single stock and portfolio level capabilities while we have seen rapid growth in lowtouch low commission electronic trading we also have experienced a marked increase in principal trading in recent years in our equities business commissions represent the largest single revenue stream however the bulk of these com missions are earned because we assume market risk or make a capital commitment to execute client trades some may confuse acting as a principal with taking a proprietary posi tion as a principal we assume market risk to facilitate trades for our clients our clients expect us to provide the necessary liquidity as a market maker to ensure that buyers and sellers can complete their trades in doing so sometimes we either opt or are forced by market conditions to hold positions in the near term while a clients transac tion the underlying reason for the trade is completed the vast majority of our trading revenue is generated from our role as a financial intermediary and broker to our investing clients year after year we serve the same clients who have come to rely on our advice market insight risk appetite and execution capability to help them navigate the securities markets an increasing percentage of our sales and trading revenue comes from our derivatives and structured products businesses we are a leader in credit derivatives and see significant growth opportunities in this area as well as in other derivative products in the years ahead our sales and trading activities produce a diverse revenue stream that has attractive longterm growth potential and is protected by a strong global franchise with high barriers to entry these revenues however like any based on capital market conditions and customer activity levels are difficult to predict particularly on a quarterly basis in addition we have proprietary investing groups in the securities divisions that have been a successful partof our business for many decades these businesses where we invest the firms own capital have generated high returns over time and increase the diversity of our business mix they also contribute to our franchise as we coinvest or provide capital to meet client needs investment management we are proud of the steady organic growth of our invest ment management business assets under management have more than doubled to  billion since we went public and today we manage more than  billion in each of our main categories of money markets fixed income and currency equity and alternative investmentsin  alone we raised  billion of new feebased client assets including significant yearoveryear growth in feebased assets in our private wealth management business serving highnetworth clients a portion of our assets under management provides us with a growing opportunity to supplement our base level of revenues with considerable incentive revenues earned when we achieve strong returns for our clients as we were able to do in  hedge funds and private equity the considerable growth in private pools of capital  namely hedge funds and private equity  has had an impact on all of our major business lines and goldman sachs is well positioned to benefit from their continued growth our securities services business provides prime brokerage services which include financing securities lending and fund administration for many of the worlds largest hedge funds goldman sachs entered this business more than  years ago long before most of our competitors our experience and client focus have firmly established us as an industry leader with a formidable market share and this is one of our fastest growing businesses over the last five years our client base has doubled in size assets have more than tripled and we have significantly expanded our international footprint we believe that the hedge fund industry is still in its infancy and we are poised to capitalize on its longterm growth we were also an early entrant in the alternative asset management space and today within our asset management unit we are one of the largest managers of direct hedge fund and hedge fund of funds assets as wellas private equity portfolios of funds at the same time we have built a strong advisory business focused on hedge funds and private equity firms providing them with mergers and acquisitions advice hedging and capital market solutions over the last three years goldman sachs has advised on more mergers and acquisitions and led more underwritings for this client base than any of our competitors our principal investments group  which in  raised an  billion corporate investment fund anda  billion real estate fund both our largest everhas also coinvested alongside our private equity clients in recent years in an era of increasingly large and complex transactions the spreading of risk and sharing of expertise are essential many of these coinvestments arise directly from our strong relationships with our private equity clients client trust and business judgment no matter what the transaction the litmus test for us is always the trust of our clients if real or perceived conflicts of interest raise fundamental questions in our clients minds all aspects of our business will be hurt strong business judgment grounded in integrity is at the core of everything we do it is how we protect our reputation deepen the trust of our clients and enhance shareholder value in the last year we embarked on an important initiative at goldman sachs the chairmans forum which placed a great deal of emphasis on business judgment and accountability over the course of  sessions around the world each lasting more than six hours we met with approximately  managing directors in groups of  or so to discuss their responsibilities as leaders through case studies and frank dialogue we examined our responsibilities as managers leading by example and exercising difficult judgments through teamwork in  we are extending the forum to our  vice presidents we intend to convey to each of them that commercial success and our reputation for integrity and judgment go hand in hand our culture and goldman sachs alumni our culture of excellence teamwork and integrity defines goldman sachs these shared values transcend the firm and are exemplified in our alumni many of these individuals become our clients pursue lifelong interests outside the securities industry or go into public service this last point merits particular mention goldman sachs has a long tradition of public service many of our people have gone on to significant positions in government and the notfor profit sector and their achievements are a source of pride for all of us the future in the course of goldman sachs history the firm has developed four underlying strengths that serve us well today and will we trust do so in the future  we have client relationships that we believe are second to none  we have a track record of anticipating and adapting to client needs market opportunities and longer term market trends  we have developed bestinclass trading andrisk management capabilities and  we have a culture that allows us to attract develop motivate and retain exceptional professionals and encourages them to work together in a real spirit of teamwork looking ahead we see favorable conditions globally buoyed by strong economic growth this is particularly encouraging because for more than a year we have experienced rising shortterm interest rates in the united states which in the past has often been a precursorto a slowing economy nonetheless there are clear risks significant structural imbalances in the global economy from the current account deficit in the united states to weak domestic demand in much of europe and asiaan increased global reliance on commodities like oil and natural gas and a world awash in liquidity this last condition is forcing investors to accept greater risk as they reach for returns and as a consequence continues to drive risk premiums to historically low levels finally the fact that the global financial system is increasingly integrated and closely connected means notwithstanding the tremendous benefits it offers that shocks to the system have the potential to be dramatically accentuated in both speed and complexity an important part of our job of managing the firm is to prepare for such risks including those that may have a low probability of occurring but could have significant adverse consequences for financial markets and our business this responsibility is embedded in our risk management processes our technology and not least the foresight of our people our franchise with strong leadership positions in the united states europe and asia allows goldman sachs to operate at the center of the global economy we believe that we are well situated to participate in the growth of key developing markets particularly china india russia and brazil our businesses are strong clientdriven franchises benefiting from positive longterm trends while they do not lend themselves to predictable earnings on a quarterly basis over the long term we are committed to providing our shareholders with returns on equity at or near the top of our industry while continuing our successful record of growing book value and earnings per share ,5.626,1.0
7,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2006,we are extraordinarily fortunate to have the opportunity to lead goldman sachs like each of our predecessors our mandate is to preserve the legacy of the firm while remaining open to the change and innovation that best meets the needs of our clients our outlook has been shaped by our having been at goldman sachs for an average of more than  years each of us has been responsible for a number of different regions and businesses across the firmand with the strong leadership in each of the firms divisions goldman sachs continues to benefit from an enduring sense of continuity all of us at the firm are stewards of a legacy forged over  years that puts our clients at the center of everything we do these cultural attributes were at the very heart ofour performance this past year for  net revenues increased  to  billion and net earnings rose  to  billion diluted earnings per common share were  an increase of  from  for the previous year our return on average common shareholders equity was  and as you can see in the chart tothe right book value per common share increased  in the last year and has grown from  at the endof our first year as a public company in  to  a compound annual rate of  over this period at the same time the firm returned over  billion of capital to shareholders by repurchasing  million shares of our common stock in  while revenues grew  last year our operating expenses increased  as a result our  pretax margin in  was a recordallowing us to produce more earnings per dollar of net revenues than at any time since we went public we also retained a greater overall percentage of earnings than in previous years with  of revenues being paid for compensation and related expenses while our business does not lend itself to predictable earnings on a quarterly basis over the long term we are committed to providing our shareholders with returns on equity at or near the top of our industry while continuing to grow book value and earnings per share in our first letter to you we will discuss some of the underlying strengths that helped drive our results and how they make goldman sachs competitive in the face of contrasting business models structural changes and evolving client needs we also will highlight some of the growth opportunities we see in various markets and regions and conclude with a few brief points about managing the firm in different market environments the evolving needs of our clients in recent years the changing needs of our clients technological advancements and the global integration of markets and economies have spurred structural changesin securities markets and in turn across all of our businesses increasingly clients expect firms like goldman sachs to commit capital on their behalf when executing transactions this has shifted the landscape in virtually every aspect of our business in investment banking offering strategic advice remains at the center of whatwe do clients frequently expect our advice to be accompanied by the provision of the capital necessary to make that advice actionable for example goldman sachs was the lead advisor to mittal steel in its acquisition of arcelor we not only provided strategic advice but alsoa significant financing commitmentwhich was critical to the feasibility of the bid in securities sales and trading market making has always been essential to the liquidity efficiency and stability of financial markets increasingly however our clients look to us to execute large complex or capitalintensive transactions on their behalf our investment management clients seek advice focused on achieving the best longterm performance for their portfolios while we must produce consistently strong results for our clients our approach must be balanced with the right asset and risk allocation specific to each clients needs this requires identifying and developing innovative products and strategies that seek to optimize returns while minimizing risk our focus on the needs of our clients has never wavered the question for us remains however how goldman sachs can best meet those needs today it has become almost axiomatic that firms like goldman sachs can be an advisor financier and coinvestor however we have long believed that not only can goldman sachs fulfill these roles but we must doso in order to be effective for our clients guided by this client focus we must constantly reexamine the boundaries of our businesses and identify new opportunities this continuous review of our strategy has led us to restructure a number of businesses to better address the needs of our clients  financing group we created the financing group  centralizing all financingrelated advice origination and execution within the firm our investment banking clients today benefit from greater connectivity within our capital markets franchise through innovative financing and risk management solutions across the equity credit and derivatives spectrum  credit and equity integration we combined thekey elements in our capital markets sales and trading operationcash equities credit derivatives and convertiblesand housed them in consolidated groups so our clients needs are served seamlessly across the entire capital structure  hightouch and lowtouch trading we recognized early on that the impact of technology and our clients desire to execute trades through multiple channels were going to fundamentally alter thecash equities market we restructured our equities business to respond to the priorities of our clients we developed and built out electronic execution platforms that now trade approximately  million shares a day at the same time we refined our hightouch trading facilitating complex client transactions through a combination of our execution capability and our willingness to assume market risk and commit capital  investing platforms we built out our investing platforms and more closely coordinated their activities with investment banking we broadened our merchant banking focus to different asset classes closing a  billion infrastructure fund and a  billion mezzanine fund in the last year  alternative assets as an early entrant in both the alternative asset management and prime brokerage spaces we recognized the important role private pools of capital would play across markets with  billion of alternative assets under management goldman sachs is one of the largest managers of direct hedge fund and hedge fund of fund assets as well as private equity portfolios of funds our securities services business which provides financing securities lending fund administration and other services for many ofthe worlds largest hedge funds has seen its client base double and balances triple in size in thelast five years the development of these businesses has helped make us more effective advisors and investment managers when we began to implement these changes we did soat a time when we already had a strong franchise across many of our businesses change understandably seemed unduly risky to many two hallmarks of the firm gave us the confidenceto initiate these changes first staying close to clientshas allowed goldman sachs to identify and anticipate opportunities at an early stage our proximity to clients allows us to understand early on what is required to meet their changing needs and we have learned the value in being willing to embrace the risk of altering our model to supply that response today we hold leading positions in ma advisory and underwriting maintain significant market sharein the equity fixed income currency and commodity markets and have one of the largest bestperforming investment management platforms in the world clients have never been more important to goldman sachs and goldman sachs has never been better positioned or capable of meeting the varying needs of our clients the second factor that has defined our response to change is our culture we strongly believe that the shared values embodied in our people are our most powerful competitive advantage our emphasis on teamwork is not an abstract goal but a living breathing reality it allows us to complement an individuals skills and expertise with his or her colleagues to provide exceptional client service across different parts of the firm and componentsof a clients transaction this teamwork is ingrainedin goldman sachs our people approach their responsibilities through the lens of a partnership they feel ownership of the entire firm not justof their division or region on a daily basis this translates into a real sense of collaboration our focus on people begins with recruitingthe right individuals onebyone to goldman sachs we then help develop their careers with regularand specific feedback and opportunities to work in different parts of goldman sachs we believe this effort has paid off with high levels of retention and deep experience across the firm despite the intense competition for talent in our industry our industry and the firms work environment are fertile ground for innovation we reward people who develop new ideas and new ways of serving our clients whether it is anticipating change in equity market structure identifying opportunities in distressed investing exploring alternative energy solutions or recognizingthe important roles private pools of capital would play our people have searched out and been receptive to new ideas and market opportunities growth opportunities while we have been fortunate in identifying and actingon many opportunities in recent years we see certain areas today where the firm has been uneven in its response one area that we believe needs increased focus is our strategy in new and developing markets particularly india russia brazil and the middle east certainly the strength of our franchise in china continues to benefit from our continuous involvement in the country since the early s two years ago we established goldman sachs gao hua securities company limited our joint venture in china in conjunction with the creation of a domestic securities company beijing gao hua securities company limited this unique structure gives us the ability to operate in the domestic chinese markets this past year we made an important strategic investment in industrial and commercial bank ofchina limited icbc chinas largest commercial bank we did so through a strategic cooperation agreement in which we committed to advise icbc on important risk management infrastructure and business development issues equally critical icbc will help us identify new clients and opportunities in one of the most significant markets we are operating in today while we believe we have a strong presence in china we need to establish a more meaningful presence in india russia brazil and the middle east in india we are establishing through goldman sachs indiaa deeper investment banking and securities business we have strong relationships with many of the largest corporations in india but the countrys rapid growth and strong talent pool merit a much more dedicated ontheground presence russia with an increasing number of companies focused on international growth represents strong investment banking sales and trading and private banking opportunities we recently opened an office in moscow and have professionals focused on serving clients in each of these divisions in brazil we were recently granted a local foreign exchange license and are moving aggressively to build a significant sales and trading operation at the same time we have new leadership in place in our investment banking division in so paulo and are intent on further strengthening our relationships in brazil and across latin america in the middle east goldman sachs is opening offices in the arabian gulf to work more closely with our investment banking and private wealth management clients we see other areas across the firm where we believe there is strong growth pwotential these include widening our investment banking footprint to work with a broader circle of corporate clients many smaller companies in the socalled middle market may benefit from our strategic advice financing knowhow and capital even more than larger companies we also see opportunities in advising governments and investors on the sale and purchase of public infra structure assets like airports shipping ports toll roads and bridges in the insurance sector the managementof certain assets such as variable annuities allows us to extend our core competency in risk managementand our trading expertise we also are building a private banking capability within our private wealth management business as part of our strategy to provide a full range of services to our clients this past year goldman sachs lost an individual who deeply embodied our culture and spirit in august john l weinberg senior chairman and former senior partner passed away during his more than  years with goldman sachs john built many of the firms most enduring client relationships and through his leadership helped elevate the firms global stature johns commitment to service and ideals bigger than one person infused his sense of obligation to the firm andits culture he was a visionary and while this description can often be overstated it does not do justice to the confidence he inspired the clarity in thinking he expressed and the integrity he exhibited throughout his career john was a crucial link in a virtuous cycle of people helping those they work with caring not only about their division but also about the firm by serving on various firmwide committees or task forces and extending that ethic to their communities and countries the culture of service that john personifiedhas continually evolved and today is represented in his successors hank paulson who had served as goldman sachs chairman and ceo for the last seven years was nominated and confirmed as the united states th secretary of the treasury each of us is indebted to hank in our own way but all of us miss his tireless passion sage counsel and innate leadership he led goldman sachs through both exhilarating and difficult times in the wake of the bursting of the technology bubble hank forced the firm and many in the industry to ask uncomfortable questions and he held himself to that same scrutiny like his four immediate predecessors hank wanted to help make a difference through government service we are proud of him and wish him every success in many ways however hanks decision is not unique our people from those junior to those senior are passionate about effecting change either through the firm or in their personal lives this past year we celebrated community teamworks th anniversary in that time the people of goldman sachs have volunteered with over  community partners in  projects to help over  people in need every day between apriland august of each year people across the firm come together to spend time with a child or senior helpto build affordable housing teach young people in schools clean up parks or work for their communities in countless other ways while the combined effect of this volunteerism is possible to quantify in numbers it is impossible to quantify in terms of the impact it has on goldman sachsit reinforces the sense of obligation we all share not only to one another but also to the wellbeing ofour communities we dont require that any of our people participate in community teamworks but approximately  people in the firm volunteered to do so in  we are also proud that goldman sachs received a public service distinction for an action that came directly out of our business in november the firm acceptedthe secretary of states award for corporate excellence for the donation of  acres of ecologically precious land in tierra del fuego chile in  we purchaseda portfolio of distressed debt which included notes secured by this environmentally significant forestlandwe determined that this unique tract of land could and should be preserved with the wildlife conservation society wcs we announced a partnership to protect much of the wilderness at the southernmost edge of south america through this unprecedented privatepublic alliance goldman sachs and the wcs are working with chilean conservationists and other partners to establisha worldclass nature reserve that preserves and protects this extraordinary land over the last two years the firm assisted six european governments in developing the international finance facility for immunisation iffim which came to fruition this past year this innovative structure will provide a steady stream of immunization funds for programs in  developing countries by issuing debt in capital markets backed by multiyear grants from sovereign donor governments these funds are projected to help save the lives of five million children in the next ten years iffim is an important example of the power of capital markets to address some of societys most important issues this is particularly true in the area of the environment in the last year we have expanded our trading activitiesin the carbon emissions market to include trading and investing in projectbased emission reduction creditsand pricing emission risk in addition to the trading of carbon credits innovative trading in these new markets can be a source of meaningful action to address global climate change lastly given the integration of markets and economies improvements in transportation and communication networks and the development of capital markets around the world goldman sachs is well positioned to be a catalyst for financial progress innovation and economic growth we are proud to be able to work with many countries both with developed and emerging markets as they restructure and reform their economies and financial systems we believe strongly that goldman sachs through the skill and knowhow of its people is contributing to the development of vibrant and dynamic markets that can efficiently allocate capital to their most productive use such markets are a vital precursor to sustainable economic growth and security as millions of people are experiencing the benefits of market development around the world the broader business environment has been very favorable for the past several years and thus far in  the financial and economic outlook across the global economy has remained generally positive however we are always cognizant that conditions can change quickly and in unforeseen ways we continually remind ourselves that the recent pace of revenue growth simply is not sustainable as a firm that operates in the center of the global economy we have been able to grow at a multiple of gdp growth and are directly and significantly affected by the macro economic environment it is difficult to regard  as anything but an exceptional year for goldman sachs one of the worst things we could do as a firm and as individuals is to begin to believe that the laws of economics dont apply to usthat somehow markets arent cyclical we also need to be mindful that our financial performance is very much a product of the opportunities the market environment and our clients make available to us no matter the conditions our job is to perform well relative to our competitors and the opportunities at hand but in absolute terms we plan for markets and conditions that wont always be as favorable as those in recent years we know that managing the firm in unfavorable environments is very different from managing it in good times but two indelible mandates will remain commitment to our clients and to our culture all of us at goldman sachs are fortunate to work ina dynamic industry with clients who expect and demand a great deal there is no substitute for being held in high regard by our clients having a clear understanding of our role in their larger success and keeping our perspective no matter the business environment we are excited and proud to lead the remarkable people of goldman sachs and through their talent expertise and client focus will work to build on the firms strong legacy ,9.537,1.0
8,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2007,in last years letter we discussed goldman sachs performance within the context of favorable market and economic conditions we also said that our job is to plan for markets and conditions that wont always be as benign while the first half of  was largely characterized by a positive operating environment the latter half of the year saw significant turbulence across global markets despite these more difficult conditions goldman sachs produced very strong performance for the year because of the talent and dedication of our people a culture of teamwork and a deep and broad client franchise in  net revenues increased  percent to  billion and net earnings rose  percent to  billion diluted earnings per common share were  an increase of  percent from  for the previous year our return on average common shareholders equity was percent the firm also returned  billionof capital to shareholders by repurchasing million shares of our common stock book value per common share increased  percent during  and has grown from  at the end of our first year as a public company in  to  a compounded annual growth rate of  percent over this period as we have stated before our business does not lend itself to predictable earnings however over the long term we are committed to the goal of providing our shareholders with returns on equity at or near the top of our industry while continuing to grow book value and earnings per share in this years letter we will discuss some of the changes that financial markets are undergoing and how the firms institutional strengths help us to respond to these changes in particular we want to highlight what we believe to be the differentiating element of goldman sachs our culture and how it infuses our approach to risk management and client service while the value of culture may not lend itself to empirical analysis we know that it is the bedrock of our financial performance the credit cycle during the last several years the global economy has benefited from a number of developmentsthe global integration of markets and economies the rise of emerging markets the growth of private pools of capital and the ability of central banks to combat inflation coalesced to help make capital historically cheap a world awash in liquidity led to an influx of investments across different asset classes and markets we saw significant increases in real estate pricesfor instance and a growing role for financial sponsors in global ma significant value was being created but many were asking if a credit bubble was taking shape not surprisingly the broad availability of credit had implications on the pricing of risk as capital flows increased around the world the search for excess yield drove credit spreads down to unprecedented levels the tightness in credit spreads extraordinarily low default rates and the runup in housing prices in the us and much of europe simply were not sustainable in hindsight it seems easy to identify precisely what happened in the daytoday management of our business identifying a bubble and calling its exact end is much more difficult as the number one global adviser in ma we are also a significant financier of many of the largest corporate transactions as a coinvestor with our clients we are active in private equity and real estate investing in our mortgage business we price assets and structure securities for institutions and other large investors our strong market share comes in part from the fact that we are active in these and other marketsand because we are willing to assume risk on behalf of our clients but at the same time when conditions deteriorate losses are unavoidable and in the course of the year we were not immune to them the strength of our client franchise some commentators have speculated that our overall performance was due to a few socalled smart bets to mitigate losses the fact is that we have a diverse set of businesses and no single business or trading opportunity dictated our performance what drove performance was the quality of our client franchise to us franchise describes the extent to which clients come to us for advice execution and sometimes partnership and through these relationships business opportunities are made available to the firm in investment banking we have a broad franchise that serves corporations financial sponsors institutions and governments in the last year we advised on each of the five largest sponsor transactions when conditions became more difficult over the summer clients sought us out as an advisor in challenging situations they facedfor example countrywide home depot supply and in connection with northern rock the uk treasury the bank of england and the financial services authority during the same period we priced an  million equity offering for apollo management on our innovative gstrue platform which we developed earlier in the year gstrue pioneered the offering and trading of privately placed securities bringing the liquidity of an exchange with the flexibility of a private placement we are proud that gstrue will be integrated into the portal alliance an industrywide platform for the trading of unregistered securities investment banking remains the front end of our growing franchise this is particularly true within the context of our principal investing activity the majority of our principal investing opportunities are sourced through our client franchise as clients seek us out as a coinvestor and other principals seek us out as partners and while retaining our leadership position in global ma we also launched merchant banking funds with aggregate commitments of  billion during the year in our securities businesses we are first and foremost a market maker we price assets manage risk and execute transactions on behalf of our clients this was particularly visible during the many tumultuous trading days during the summer on some occasions our us shares trading platforms processed over two billion shares a day more than double our average volume we also experienced record customer activity in our credit rates and currency businesses not only during the summer but for much of the year in our asset management business we manage  billion in total assets under management in the last year alone we attracted inflows of  billion our ability to offer clients access to a broad range of investment strategies from active equity to private equity fund of funds to plain vanilla fixed income and money market products has been a key differentiating factor there are however important areas for us to continue to address like many others in the quantitative fund space we have had issues with the performance of certain of our quantitative funds we know that we disappointed our clients in those funds and we are focused on learning from this past years events in addition direct quantitative hedge funds represent only five percent of our assets under management and we realize the importance of expanding our product portfolio in actively managed strategies our stake in the global economy each of our businesses benefits from a number of different factors or trends from the development of products and instruments to specific market dynamics all of our businesses however will continue to be positively driven by the global integration of economies and markets in  our pretax earnings outside the us exceeded  percent for the first time in a seminal research piece that coined the term brics we identified early on the breakout potential of the highgrowth countries of brazil russia india and china historically however we have not built much physical infrastructure in the emerging markets that changed in the last two years as we opened offices in mumbai moscow so paulo dubai doha and tel aviv we are also making strategic investments in these markets we are currently negotiating a strategic alliance in saudi aroabia with ncb capital the securities arm of national commercial bank the largest bank in the middle east we have invested over  billionin india and plan to invest more and we have recently acquired an asset management platformin south korea with  billion in assets under management to further develop our distribution capabilities in the region the next step for us is to build out our securities capabilities in these growth markets in brazil we are now licensed to do onshore fixed income activities in russia we have built a platform to trade both cash equity and fixed income products and select overthecounter derivative products in india we have cash futures and options capabilities in china we can trade cash products throughgao hua securities company limited our joint venture partner and in south korea we received our banking license which allows us to offer a broader range of products to our clients we continue to see more opportunities in these and other developing markets globally private wealth management pwm also represents a significant opportunity for the firm and we are determined to grow our footprint while important as a revenue source in its own right our pwm business connects us with a growing class of entrepreneurs around the world who not only benefit from our private banking skills but also rely upon our investment banking and securities expertise we have made key management hires in pwmand are developing onshore capabilities in china and brazil we are expanding our swiss banking capabilities to grow our offshore franchise in important markets we also have gs bank usa an industrial loan corporation in the us and a fully operational bank in ireland to augment our global private banking platform our strategy of being an advisor financier and investor is proving especially effective as we expand globally although we are relatively new to some of these markets we have been able to win important mandates because of the attraction of our model the strength of our reputation and our commitment to the local region for example we opened offices in dubai and mumbai in  and were # in announced ma in both the middle east and india this is all part of a broader strategy of identifying highgrowth areas around the world and building our franchise in tandem with these economies our culture our ability to perform rests on a shared passion for teamwork integrity and excellence teamworkis not an abstract goal but a reality it allows us to complement an individuals skills and expertise with those of his or her colleagues to provide exceptional client service across different parts of the firm our people are also resultsdriven and measure their effectiveness by the successes of our clients culture is a difficult concept to define but we believe it is what truly differentiates goldman sachs goldman sachs partnership ethos still runs throughout the firm this mentality creates a sense of ownership of the firms capital risk and profitabilityat all levels we have over  employees but we try every day to make the firm feel smaller whether we communicate with people divisionally regionally or at the senior leadership level we reinforce the same values each person at goldman sachs is a steward of our legacy and the culture it represents one example of this is the chairmans forum for the past year the three of us conducted over  half day sessions in the us europe and asia with every managing director md to talk about his or her role in advancing our client franchise we spent more time on this initiative than any other given the fact that our mds set the tone throughout the firm there were few more important ways to invest our time the firm also imbues a sense of partnership through our compensation process we take a comprehensive view on performance versus one limited to individual results while individual performance matters everyones pay is dependent on how goldman sachs performs overall people are incentivized to act in a way that supports the firm as a whole and not to be parochial about their specific division or business unit ultimately our success depends on the quality of the people we attract and retain we spend enormous amounts of time on these issues it begins with recruiting at goldman sachs everyone from our junior to our most senior people commits timeand focus to our recruiting efforts our management committee members have participated in nearly  recruiting events over the last year the priority we place on recruiting is one reason why more than  percent of the offers we extended globally to under graduates and graduates in  were accepted once they come into the firm our people expect ongoing training and development within gs university there are over  online and classroom courses ninety percent of our people participated  completing  hours of training during the year our people also expect to have a broad range of experiences over the course of their careers many of us including most of our senior leadership have worked in multiple divisions and in multiple regions even after people leave goldman sachs they still tend to identify with our firm and we foster that connection in the last two years we have held events for alumni in the us europe and this year asia over  percent of our retired partners have attended at least one event and nearly  former gs professionals have registered on our alumni web site in october  we held an alumni event in london and over  people attended we have a rich history and tradition and we invest in it our alumni help us recruit participate in volunteer activities and come back to speak to our people in many cases they are also clients of the firm not only does all of this help validate our culture it provides a real tangible value that transcends any single generation good people hire good people through this process the feeling of ownership is passed on our culture is selfsustaining and selfperpetuating risk management not surprisingly the culture of our firm anchors our approach to risk management that approach is characterized by accountability escalation and communication a large part of this discipline is represented in the marking process which assigns value to a position based on its currently traded market price we believe that rigorous mark tomarket accounting for financial instruments is fundamental to prudent management because it facilitates a clear view of risk it allows us to manage market risk limits monitor exposure to credit risk and manage our liquidity requirements effective risk management is demanding and often difficult but it lies at the heart of the management of a financial institution and we believe it is a core competence that helps define goldman sachs we also put great value in our firmwide committees such as the risk committee which monitors financial risk the commitments committee which looks at our underwriting and distribution activities the capital committee which focuses on credit extension and the business practices committee which reviews operational and reputational risk these committees create a system of checks and balances that encourage communication between people in both control and business positions and when necessary the speedy escalation of a potential issue over onehalf of the members of our firmwide committees have worked in two or more divisions and the average tenure at the firm of committee members is  years more broadly we place great importance on communication between revenue and control areas this translates into a constant flow of risk reports and the end result is a better understanding of the risks we are taking closely related to communication and escalation is accountability people have to feel responsible for the decisions they make and for the decisions their subordinates make if we suffer a credit loss the relevant business is not absolved of the consequences simply because the risk was approved by the credit department taken together all flow into one another communication encourages escalation and escalation reinforces accountability because we are in the business of assuming risk on behalf of our clients we know we will have losses from time to time thats why it is important to give people the confidence and support to stay committed to those businesses during difficult times our appetite for risk taking is central to our ability to accomplish our clients objectives and to be profitable but our appetite is calibrated by balancing potential risk and reward as market conditions shift and evolve and meaningful opportunities ebb and flow clearly market conditions can change abruptly we must never forget that risk is just thatrisk with all its consequences goldman sachs gives another important part of our culture is philanthropy and service we are proud that so many of our people support hundreds of nonprofit organizations around the world serving on the boards of educational institutions charities and environmental organizations earlier this year building on goldman sachs long tradition of philanthropy we announced one of our most significant philanthropic initiatives to date in launching goldman sachs gives a donoradvised fund the firms partners agreed to commit a part of their overall compensation to charitable organizations individual accounts have been established within goldman sachs gives for participating partners who will recommend charitable organizations as recipients thereby diversifying the overall philanthropy of our firm and our people in addition the firm made a separate contribution to goldman sachs gives through the collective generosity of our people we expect that goldman sachs gives will grow to more than  billion over the next few years and will become a significant source of dedicated charitable funds this important initiative will provide a meaningful way for our people to increase their current support of nonprofit organizations around the world looking ahead some may characterize culture and the attributeswe described above as soft issues to us our culture sustains our client franchise and reputation in that sense it is a tangible driver of our performance the relative strength of our franchise can sometimes be masked by generally favorable markets the second half of the years more difficult conditions we believe highlighted the depth and breadth of our client franchise conditions across various markets remain challenging our industry is a cyclical one with little predictability in the short term as a firm that operates in the center of the global economy we grow at a multiple of gdp growth and are directly affected by the macroeconomic environmentit is important to remember that given our stake in the global economy the recent pace of earnings growth simply is not sustainable however over the longer term we remain optimistic that secular growth trends notably the rise of the brics and the evolution of markets and instruments will play to the strengths of our businesses and allow us to grow our franchise behind the hard numbers of financial performanceis an internal set of shared values at goldman sachs these values fuel a culture of teamwork and the rigor of our risk management we will make our fair share of mistakes and we will experience losses guaranteed however we manage our business over the long term and we believe that the cultural attributes of goldman sachs will continue to enable us to generate strong returns for our shareholders ,11.6,1.0
9,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2008,fellow shareholders when we wrote to you last a relatively healthy market environment in the first half of  had given way to a much more challenging one marked by significant volatility for the remainder of the year since that time global financial markets have been buffeted by a series of extraordinary and tumultuous events most acutely this past fall a global contagion of fear and panic choked off the arteries of finance compounding a broader deterioration of the global economy global equity markets were down anywhere from  to  in  credit markets became virtually frozen several major financial institutions were either stabilized by their governments the private sector or filed for bankruptcy hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs over  trillion in creditrelated losses were recorded and nearly  trillion in market value was wiped out in a matter of months all of us in one way or another have been humbled by these events it is a truism that markets are cyclical that years of optimism and prosperity can be quickly undone by pessimism and uncertainty but this time the drivers and the consequences are broader in scope and much more intense in effect as we have said in our previous letters we have always seen it as our responsibility as leaders of goldman sachs to ensure that the firm is prepared to deal with adverse conditions so that we are able to mitigate the downside and if possible position the firm to take advantage of the opportunities presented by improving markets while recent markets have tested our firm like few other times in our year history we are pleased to report that we not only remained profitable in  but also our culture client franchise and strategy have proven extremely resilient in a very challenging environment net revenues fell  to  billion and net earnings decreased  to  billion diluted earnings per common share were  and our return on average common shareholders equity was  we grew book value per share during  and since our ipo it has grown at a compound annual growth rate of  in this years letter we would like to address some of the implications of recent events for goldman sachs and for our industry we will also discuss how our integrated business model diverse revenue mix and intense focus on risk management position us favorably going forward finally we will talk about how the resiliency of our culture and focus on our clients will continue to be the strongest catalysts for our longterm success a history of adaptation as we confront todays challenges we have not lost sightof the fact that many of the most important opportunities and successesin goldman sachs history came about during times of stress during the asian crisis at the end of the last decade we made several significant investments in consumer and real estate assets after the dislocation that followed long term capital managements problems in  we increased our fixed income market share following the telecom and technology bubble we built up our private equity and mezzanine investments after the failure of enron when capital was scarce in the power sector we invested in power plants resulting in recurring trading revenues as well as gains from restructuring power contracts in each instance goldman sachs was able to identify opportunities during times of market dislocation in this same vein we have proven our ability to adapt our own structure time and again to meet rapidly shifting market conditions in the last two decades we have taken dramatic steps to transform ourselves to best serve the needs of our clients in the face of formidable circumstances when a stable capital base and increased funding diversification became necessary we converted from a private partnership to a publicly traded company when scale became critical we transformed ourselves from a relatively small firm to a fortune  company when our clients demanded a more integrated approach we realigned and grew the firm to become a comprehensive source of advice financing and coinvestment providing clients the wherewithal to realize their goals and as markets opened up and growth accelerated around the world we expanded from being mainly a usbased firm to a truly global organization in every instance questions about our strategy were raised but our franchise and culture emerged stronger primarily because we never lost sight of the importance of developing and maintaining strong client relationships and responding to structural market developments bank holding company continuing this track record of responsiveness in  we became a bank holding company bhc this was done to allow goldman sachs to address market perceptions that placed a premium on the value of oversight by the federal reserve board and to be able to access a broader set of funding alternatives in our decision we saw nothing about becoming a bhc that would fundamentally detract from our core mission of growing our franchise as a leading global investment banking securities and investment management firm to this point many bank holding companies have core competencies that focus on a particular subset of financial services whether commercial banking private or personal banking trust and custodial banking asset management or others at goldman sachs our core competencies will remain in the services and products that we have long provided to our largely institutional client base as an advisor financier market maker asset manager and coinvestor as part of our transition to a bhc we expanded goldman sachs bank usa at the end of  it held approximately  billion in assets heading into  we will look to further diversify our funding base by growing the banks deposits organically through our private wealth management business thirdparty distribution and through the acquisition of deposits other creative ideas like the innovative way we were able to increase our lending capacity in  through the creation of our william street program are also under consideration capital purchase program goldman sachs received an investment of  billion as a participant in the us treasurys tarp capital purchase program to help promote the broader stability of the financial system this capital combined with the  billion of capital we raised three weeks before receiving the tarp funds gives us an even stronger balance sheet and increases our ability to extend capital to our clients and to inject liquidity across markets we take our responsibility as a recipient of tarp capital very seriously and recognize the important role this and the other government actions play in the underlying stability of the system we appreciate that the tarp funds were never intended to be permanent capital when conditions allow and with the support of our regulators and the us treasury we look forward to paying back the us governments investment so that money can be used elsewhere to support our economy the deleveraging cycle it is important to consider where we are in terms of the deleveraging cycle we believe that the housingled downturn has at least five distinct elements the first was the us residential mortgage crisis we outperformed here because of our reluctance to enter the retail mortgage origination business and our active management of risk exposures the next was related to the broader credit markets given our leading ma franchise we had a large number of leveraged loans as market conditions deteriorated we suffered losses in our loan portfolio but we monitored our exposure carefully and reduced it aggressively the third aspect has been the pressure on global equitymarkets and other assets since coinvestment is integral to our strategy and we mark all our assets to market we were naturally exposed to significant market swings in equity and other asset classes however we manage our coinvestments for the longerterm and have a track record of outperforming the market through the cycle commercial real estate is also undergoing stress as theability to securitize commercial real estate mortgages remains constricted and vacancy rates are increasing while we experienced losses in our portfolio of commercial real estate assets we have reduced our exposure to this sector over the past year the nextand we hope the final phaseis the consumer credit cycle here goldman sachs has no direct material exposures to credit cards auto loans home equity loans or other consumer loans diverse global client franchise businesses in the midst of change certain attributes of goldman sachs will remain uncompromised no matter how the marketplace evolves chief among these is our commitment to a balanced welldiversified revenue stream across our global franchise with an emphasis on recurring feedriven businesses in investment banking while corporate activity levels across our core advisory and underwriting businesses declined in  we retained our # ranking in announced global ma our nonleague table businesses including private placements and rights offerings rose significantly as a percentage of our equity underwriting revenues and through our roles as advisor and risk manager we were able to provide effective risk management solutions to corporate clients in our securities sales and trading businesses despite significant weakness in the fourth quarter we were profitable for the full year thanks in large part to our diverse set of global businesses in fixed income currencies and commodities our macro businesses including currencies interest rates and commodities generated strong and in some cases record net revenues offsetting asset price pressures and related losses in credit and mortgages equities produced its second best annual net revenues despite the declines in global equity markets and losses in our principal strategies business high levels of client activity drove significant opportunities across cash trading and derivatives for the year our principal investing business experienced a particularly difficult year given the significant decline in equity values but the quality of our portfolio has allowed us to perform better than recent equity market declines would suggest in our real estate principal investing business weakening fundamentals could impact valuations further in the near term however we are confident of our ability to outperform over the cycle our asset management business is one of our most diverse businesses by both product offering and geography we will continue to leverage our longterm track record and our robust distribution relationships to grow assets under management our private wealth management business presents a particularly interesting opportunity within this business we continue to provide our advisors with access to the best intellectual capital goldman sachs has to offer we are building this platform into a fullservice wealth advisory business with private banking trust services and wealth planning businesses securities services has undergone significant changes over the past six months given the evolution in the hedge fund industry we have rigorously managed this business through a very difficult year and ended up posting record results while we expect assets under management for the industry as a whole to decline in  as a result of performance issues and redemptions prime brokerage remains core to our franchise and we are further refining our model to reflect the changed landscape we remain a market leader and our deep client relationships extensive securities lending capacity and advanced technology will continue to drive a solid revenue opportunity for the firm strengthening our balance sheet a key factor contributing to our relative strength has been our focus on risk management we have long believed that the only way to remove risk in its entiretyand without introducing other exposuresis through a sale without the commitment to sell assets throughoutthe year regardless of the fact that many market participants believed that the prices available were at distressed levels our performance would have been materially weaker we are also less susceptible to future losses from declining value in the same asset classes during the fourth quarter alone we reduced our balance sheet by nearly  this was a broadbased reduction and was not concentrated on liquid lower risk assets this reduction combined with almost  billion in new capital resulted in an over  decline in adjusted and gross leverage ratios and our tier  ratio increased from  at the end of the second quarter of  to  at the end of the year in addition we grew our pool of excess liquidity to an average of  billion during the fourth quarter given the elevated level of riskadjusted capital lower legacy exposures and immaterial direct consumer exposure we believe that we are wellpositioned to deal with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead the lessons from  risk management will come to define the events of  and beyond our firm certainly didnt get everything right and seefinancial informationmanagements discussion and analysisequity capital consolidated capital requirements for further information regarding our tier  ratio there are some decisions we would prefer to take back but how we dealt with potentially large exposures our fair value accounting discipline and the independence of our risk management function were reinforcing for the firm in  first we sought to ensure that our exposures werent outsized in the first place and worked to reduce such exposures whenever it was possible and made sense to do so second we have heard some argue that fair value accounting which assigns current market values to financial assets and liabilitiesis one of the major reasons for exacerbating the credit crisis we see it differently the proper valuation of assets and liabilities of positions and commitments is essential if risk is to be managed effectively for goldman sachs the daily marking of positions to current market prices was a key contributor to our decision to reduce risk relatively early in markets and in instruments that were deteriorating this process can be difficult and sometimes painful but we believe it is a discipline that should define financial institutions lastly we place great importance in the independence of risk and control functions just as important risk managers have at least equal stature with their counterparts in producing divisions if there is a question about a mark or a disagreement about a risk limit the risk managers view prevails the strength of our culture  was a trying time for our peoplefor individuals whose careers have spanned decades and for those who joined recently and found themselves facing one of the most difficult periods in the history of our industry over the course of the year both of us made it a point to spend more time walking the floors our people junior to senior were not hesitant to offer their insights thoughts and ideas our people care deeply about the firm and exhibit a real sense of ownership they know that clients are contending with difficult economic and financial pressures and through it all our people maintained a rigorous client focus we have never been prouder to be a part of this team in markets such as these it would be easy to get locked into shortterm thinking yet the opposite happened late into the year we announced our new class of managing directors and partners some could have suggested that we delay our process given the significant amount of time and effort that goes into it instead during the most difficult days our people across every division and region made time to think about the next generation of leadership at goldman sachs as in previous periods of difficulty such times produce strong leaders nothing validates our culture more than identifying people who question probe and assert their views up and down the firm moments such as these test a firms culture but an ethos of teamwork integrity excellence and partnership continues to be the lifeblood of goldman sachs over the course of his career jon winkelried made exceptional contributions to our firm and our culture he ran many of our most important businesses helped strengthen our global client franchise and mentored many of goldman sachs leaders after  years at the firm jon has decided to retire we thank him for his service to goldman sachs  women nothing speaks to the firms value system more than our global initiative  women in march we announced we would commit  million over five years to provide a business and management education to  underserved women around the world we are doing this by creating partnerships between a global network of universities and ngos for instance schools are working together to establish or expand certificate programs ranging from five weeks to six months that include such courses as marketing accounting market research writing a business plan strategic planning accessing capital and ecommerce these innovative certificate programs are pragmatic flexible and shorter term and will help open doors for thousands of women whose financial and practical circumstances would normally prevent them from receiving a traditional business education by the end of  the firm announced  academic partnerships aimed at providing training to deserving women across africa asia the middle east latin america and the united states an example from the already established partnerships include the wharton school of management and the american university in cairo creating a certificate program on leadership management skills for  women another is the university of michigan and the school of finance and banking in rwanda training  women in a sixmonth certificate in business and entrepreneurship and we are working with mills college in california which offers one of only two mba programs in the country designed specifically for women to provide full tuition and mentoring for women who have excelled academically but are not able to complete their degree without financial assistance in october the first  of the  women scholars graduated from a certificate course in entrepreneurial management at the pan african university in lagos nigeria as is the case with all of the  women partnerships the people of goldman sachs are serving as mentors through an online mentoring program our peopleoften after work and on weekendsare engaging the first classes of scholarship recipients in addition our people are providing inperson mentoring and guest lecturing looking ahead while recent troubles have more than secured their placein history we should not forget that there have been several formidable market dislocations in the last  years as long as human emotions influence decisionmaking and we grapple with the inherent tension between the spirit of innovation and the comfort of stability this wont be the last financial crisis with which the world will have to contend we recognize our obligation to the broader financial system the financial services industry has much to do to regainthe publics trust and to help restore stability and vitality to our financial system goldman sachs is committed to playing a constructive role as policymakers consider significant regulatory reform we remain intent on having a strong presence in highgrowth markets around the world while growth rates have slowed we continue to see important opportunities in a number of emerging economies and we believe that our ontheground presence and local expertise bodes well for our prospects there we have cultivated an extraordinary client franchise we have broad and deep businesses across the globe we have proven our ability to grow across a range of different environments and most importantly we have recruited and retained generations of talented and dedicated people who thrive on adapting to the market meeting challenges and producing positive results for our clients the year ahead will bring with it a rapidly shifting and demanding environment our mandate is to grow our business through our core strengths as an advisor financier market maker asset manager and coinvestor the integration of that model and strategy is a powerful and unique one we believe that goldman sachs is wellpositioned to realize the very significant near and longer term market opportunities available and as a result to produce industryleading returns for our shareholders over the cycle ,2.322,0.0
10,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2009,when we reported to you last the worlds financial system and the global economy remained in the grips of uncertainty our industry had been shaken to its foundation in the wake of severe volatility a sharp deterioration in equity values and extreme illiquidity across most credit markets governments regulators and market participants were forced to confront simultaneously the unwinding of several financial institutions ensuring shortterm market stability shoring up investor confidence and enacting measures to secure the longterm viability of the global capital markets  by the end of  owed in no small part to actions taken by governments to fortify the system conditions across financial markets had improved significantly and to an extent few predicted or thought possible equity prices largely rebounded credit spreads tightened and market activity was revitalized by investors seeking new opportunities all of which imply renewed optimism if not the beginnings of a potential recovery while improving financial conditions are often a precursor to better economic ones the economy nevertheless remains fragile unemployment is high consumer spending tepid and access to credit for many smaller businesses continues to be elusive the effects of unwinding leverage embedded in the system may linger for some time as the global economy works its way to recovery the roles that we play for our clients become even more important as companies and investors position themselves to emerge stronger following the crisis the firms focus on staying close to our clients and helping them to navigate uncertainty and achieve their objectives is largely responsible for what proved to be a year of resiliency across our businesses and by extension a strong performance for goldman sachs in  the firm generated net revenues of  billion with net earnings of  billion diluted earnings per common share were  and our return on average common shareholders equity was  percent book value per common share increased  percent during  and has grown from  at the end of our first year as a public company in  to  a compounded annual growth rate of  percent over this period this past year clients came to goldman sachs because of our ability to integrate advice financing market making and investing capabilities with sophisticated risk management importantly during the crisis we were able to commit capital when market liquidity and capital were scarce our duty to shareholders is to protect and grow our clientfocused franchise by remaining true to our teamwork and performancedriven culture our shared values have allowed us to be nimble and reactive yet governed by prudent longterm thinking in this years letter we will address some of the steps goldman sachs took to further strengthen our capital liquidity and competitive position in  we will discuss the firms client franchise and our contribution to wellfunctioning markets in times of distress and on an ongoing basis by operating at the center of global capital markets we also will report to you on how our integrated business model diverse revenue streams and risk management practices serve as the core of our strategy importantly we will focus on how our people and culture have been and remain fundamental to the firms success finallywe will review the regulatory reform agenda as well as certain developments that attracted considerable attention over the course of the year extraordinary measures looking back on  it is impossible to know what would have happened to the financial system absent concerted government action around the world institutions were hoarding cash and were unwilling to transact with each other this had extreme consequences for even the healthiest of financial institutions and companies through aggressive measures ranging from liquidity and funding facilities to direct investment programs the government arrested the contagious fear that had engulfed the global financial system and averted more acute circumstances we believe such efforts were absolutely critical to protecting the financial system and ensuring the continued viability of the global economy goldman sachs is grateful for the indispensable role governments played and we recognize that our firm and our shareholders benefited from it in june  the firm repaid the us governments investment of  billion in goldman sachs as a participant in the us treasurys tarp capital purchase program which was designed to promote the broader stability of the financial system we subsequently repurchased the warrants acquired by the us treasury in connection with that investment which when combined with preferred dividends paid represented an additional  billion or an annualized  percent return for us taxpayers conservative financial profile in light of the events of the last two years we believe it is important to highlight for our shareholders that goldman sachs did not and does not operate or manage our risk with any expectation of outside assistance given our roots as a privately held partnership we have always focused on maintaining a conservative financial profile and view liquidity as the single most important consideration for a financial institution having steadily increased our global core excess pool of liquidity for several years it stood at roughly  billion in cash or highly liquid securities or almost  percent of our balance sheet at the end of  keeping this pool of liquidity is expensive but in our judgment it is money wellworth spending leading up to  we reduced our exposures even though it meant selling at prices many thought were irrational when the crisis hit we raised nearly  billion in capital billionof preferred equity from berkshire hathaway and  billion in common equity  without any knowledge that tarp funds would be forthcoming while the past two years have validated our conservative approach to liquidity and to managing our risk they have also prompted significant change within our organization specifically we have embraced new realities pertaining to regulation and ensuring that our financial strength remains in line with our commitment to the longterm stability of our franchise and the overall markets we became a financial holding company now regulated primarily by the federal reserve and subject to new capital and leverage tests since may  our balance sheet has fallen by approximately onequarter while our capital has increased by over onehalf over  percent of our shareholders equityis common equity the amount of level or illiquidassets is down by  percent representing less than  percent of our total assets in  our baselitier  capital ratio increased to  percent well in excess of the required minimum important roles we playon behalf of our clientsmaintaining a sound financial profile is vital if we are to be effective in meeting the needs of our clients among theroles we play for our largely institutional client base are advisor financier market maker asset manager and coinvestor strategic advice our advisory business serves as our primary point of contact with our clients and is often the genesis for sourcing other opportunities to serve them in some instances business garnered from our longstanding investment banking relationships is captured from a financial reporting perspective in the revenues reported within other segments particularly within our trading and principal investments segment for instance we have been successfully building our risk management solutions business within investment banking  encapsulating our strategy of integrating advice capital and risk management expertise since  revenues from this business have grown  percent compounded annually this trend is consistent with our business model and operating philosophy which are predicated on the firm functioning as an integrated whole while classic advisory revenues in  reached a near cyclical low the latter half of the year yielded greater levels of strategic dialogues reflecting an improvement in ceo confidence although it is difficult to predict what types of transactions or which industries will rebound most quickly our broad and deep franchise allows goldman sachs to remain knowledgeable and relevant across multiple sectors and poised to serve our clients over the past five years investment banking has advised over  clients in  countries solidifying our leading market share position and allowing us to retain industryleading positions in crossborder acquirer target and strategic defense advisory league tables financing for growth our investment banking relationships are also the basis for most of our financing mandates as a financial intermediary goldman sachs acts to match the capitalof our investing clients with the needs of our corporateand government clients who rely on financing to generate growth create jobs and deliver the products and services that drive economic development since the beginning of  we have underwritten over  billion in corporate debt and over  billion in equity and equityrelated products across approximately  offerings for  clients globallywe have a long history of helping states and municipalities access the capital markets since entering the public finance business in  goldman sachs has been one of the most significant industry participants and over the past decade has helped states and municipalities raise over  billion in capital in  we were the number one underwriter for the build america bond program which allows states and municipalities to meet their borrowing needs and invest in infrastructure projects we also helped finance over  billion for nonprofit institutions including education services healthcare and government entities market intermediary through our role as a market maker we commit and deploy our capital to ensure that buyers and sellers can complete their transactions contributing to the liquidity efficiency and stability of financial markets throughout the crisis we made prices when markets were volatile and illiquid and extended credit when credit was scarce fixed income commodities and currencies ficc and equities our market intermediation businesses that comprise our securities division were meaningful drivers of our strong firmwide performance last year by remaining close to our clients we were able to direct our human and financial capital to those businesses within our market making franchise that most reflected clients interests and needs another important component of growth has been the dynamic that as clients grow in size the scope of the business that they execute with the firm also increasesin   of our clients were active across both equities and ficc products which is up  percent from  clientdriven risk exposures given concern by some over the nature and level of risk that financial institutions undertake it is important to note that for goldman sachs the vast majority of the risk we take and the revenues we generate is derived from trades that advance a client need or objective by way of example in  an energy consumer asked us to help protect it against a rise in the cost of fuel concerned that an increase would affect its ability to grow to accomplish this goldman sachs structured a longterm collateralized hedge facility we then entered into hedges to offset the fuel price risk that we had assumed as part of our normal accounting and risk management we regularly revalue the amount of collateral necessary to be posted when fuel prices declined duringthe life of the transaction we also routinely hedge our client counterparty risk in addition to receiving collateral in the end we were able to structure the transaction at a fair price forour client and generate an attractive riskadjusted return for the firm and our shareholders this is representative of the risk we assume and manage daily to allow our clients to focus on their underlying businesses coinvesting coinvesting is another way we directly align the firms interests with those of our clients twothirds of our corporate investing opportunities are sourced from our investment banking relationships in addition the vast majority of money committed to our investing funds comes from our clients who seek to partner with us while returns fluctuate based on equity market performance and other factors our merchant banking businesses have provided much needed capital to our investment banking clients and achieved strong returns for our investors and shareholders over the long term this business generates management fees as well as incentive fees based on the funds performance as a result our merchant banking business helps diversify the firms revenues the focus of our funds spans the capital structure including senior debt mezzanine and private equity funds during periods of  when public market liquidity dried up our senior loan and mezzanine funds in particular extended needed capitalto a variety of companies whose growth opportunities would otherwise have been limited there also is significant diversity within the funds themselves our corporate equity fund portfolio represents eight different industry groups with no one industry contributing morethan  percent looking ahead we remain wellpositioned together with our clients to invest in attractively priced assets managing assets managing our clients assets remains an important growth opportunity for goldman sachs and we continue to allocate significant time and resources to building our asset management businesses within our investment management division and expanding our portfolio management capabilities at the time of our ipo in  our goal was to double assets under management aum over five years we were successful and by may  we had doubled aum once again our success follows a track record of strong investment returns for our clients as with all of our businesses our client base is diverse numbering  institutional clients and thirdparty distributors and over  private wealth management accounts our range of products across money markets fixed income equity and alternative investments is offered through distribution channels to institutional highnetworth clients and thirdparty retail clients around the world to advance our strategy in  we doubled our thirdparty distribution sales force and significantly increased our institutional and private wealth management coverage included in our expanded coverage focus are government sponsored organizations corporate pension funds insurance companies and growth markets such as brazil the middle east and china investments in growth brics and emerging markets we continue to believe that this will be the century of the brics and other high growth markets they have helped lead the global recovery and in our minds are even more compelling now as a result the emerging markets remain integral to our growth strategy at the beginning of the crisis many wondered if or to what extent the brics and other growth markets would be able to decouple from the more established economies sucha decoupling had little precedent today it appears that the growth markets are helping lead the recovery in the global economy they continue to attract capital from abroad and also are making significant longterm investments to position themselves for the future we believe goldman sachs is similarly wellpositioned to expand our franchise in step with these countries growth we remain focused on implementing a familiar strategy expand our advisory client coverage build underwriting capabilities develop sales and trading expertise and grow our wealth management business investing in people and communities while goldman sachs serves a wide range of clients with individual needs and goals we also believe that financial institutions have a larger obligation to the financial system the broader economy and the communities in which their employees work and live for us this means helping new enterprises succeed and grow catalyzing economic development and financing community projects that create a better quality of life for more people given that our firm is most successful when economies and markets thrive this is in our interest and that of our shareholders the firms urban investment group is helping to create thousands of affordable housing units and funding businesses in underserved communities helping to bring together money and innovative ideas to revitalize cities across the united states by making investments loans and grants and through service initiatives we are working to transform distressed neighborhoods into vibrant and sustainable places of opportunity as one example with a  million investment in the new york equity fund goldman sachs is providing  units of muchneeded affordable housing for lowincome new yorkers as part ofa wider effort to rehabilitate  buildings across harlem the south bronx and brooklyn we are pleased to report that our women initiative which we introduced to you in last years shareholders letter has exceeded our own expectations and is today providing underserved female entrepreneurs with a business education through partnerships with more than  academic institutions and nonprofits in  countries including india brazil china afghanistan rwanda and the united states our early experience is confirming research by the world bank goldman sachs and the united nations that educating women can lead to real economic growth and healthier safer and bettereducated communities  small businesses based on the results of  women goldman sachs announced in  a new effort called  small businesses this  million fiveyear program aims to unlock the growth and jobcreation potential of  businesses across the united states through greater access to business education mentors and networks and financial capital it is based on the broadly held view of leading experts that a combination of education capital and support services best addresses the barriers to growth for small businesses the programs business and management curriculum is supported by a  million commitment to community colleges and universities to build educational capacity and to provide scholarships to underserved small business owners goldman sachs has committed  million through a mix of lending and philanthropic support to community development financial institutions to help get capitalflowing to small businesses the programs critical support services will connect small business owners with mentoring networking and advice available through our various  small businesses partners as with  women the people of goldman sachs will give freely of their time and professional skills to serve as mentors and guest lecturers as well as to participate on selection committees we believe this approach is in keeping with the best tradition of our firm aligning our philanthropic and growth development efforts with our core competencies and expertise goldman sachs gives we also announced a  million philanthropic contribution to the firms donoradvised fund goldman sachs gives which was established in  the firms compensation for partners was reduced to fund this charitable contribution reflecting the firms tradition of philanthropy we have asked our partners to recommend charitable organizations that focus on the critical areas of creating jobs and economic growth building and stabilizing communities honoring service and veterans and increasing educational opportunities our people while an often used phrase it is true in every way at goldman sachs our people are our most important asset we do not have material property plant and equipment assets rather we have talented entrepreneurial professionals who are dedicated to the firms mission of supporting economic growth in  our people saton  nonprofit boards and  of us volunteered for over  local nonprofits through our community teamworks program in short our people are central to who we are to the cohesiveness of our culture and to our ability to generate attractive returns for shareholders throughout  we stayed true to our focus on people every member of our management committee participated in oncampus recruiting while another  recruiting hours were undertaken by people across the firm through gs university we provided  hours of training and leveraged our senior leaders as faculty to provide learning opportunities to our people more broadly last yearfor example over  courses were taught by the firms managing directors and vice presidents as demonstrated in the way we source opportunities and serve our clients goldman sachs operates with a onefirm philosophy our people are rewarded for their accomplishments by how they work and succeed in teams with the longterm interests of the organization always coming before those of the individual we believe this partnership ethos which reflects the firms longstanding business principles is a competitive advantage that drives the companys overall performance pay for performance providing the best advice and execution to our clients meansin turn providing our people with attractive career opportunities and longterm incentives we have not been blind to the attention on our industry and in particular on goldman sachs with respect to compensation we have adopted very specific compensation principles which we presented at our  annual meeting of shareholders to ensure an even stronger relationship between pay and performance these principles are designed to encourage a real sense of teamwork and communication binding individual shortterm interests to the institutions longterm interests evaluate performance on a multiyear basis discourage excessive or concentrated risk taking  allow us to attract and retain proven talent and align aggregate compensation for the firm with performance over the cycleconsistent with our principles in december we announced that for  the firms entire management committee would receive  percent of their discretionary compensation inthe form of shares at risk which have a fiveyear period during which an enhanced recapture provision will permit the firm to recapture the shares in cases where an employee engaged in materially improper risk analysis or failed sufficiently to raise concerns about risks enhancing our recapture provision is intended to ensure that our employees are accountable for the future impact of their decisions to reinforce the importance of risk controls to the firm and to make clear that our compensation practices do not reward taking excessive risk the enhanced recapture rights build off an existing clawback mechanism that goes well beyond employee acts of fraud or malfeasance and includes conduct that is detrimental to the firm including conduct resulting in a material restatement of the financial statements or material financial harm to the firm or one of its business units in addition our shareholders will have an advisory vote on the firms compensation principles and the compensation of its named executive officers at the firms annual meeting of shareholders in may  finally goldman sachs does not set aside an actual poolfor discretionary compensation or bonuses during the course of the year we accrue an estimate of compensation expenses each of the first three quarters only at year end with the visibility of our fullyear performance do we make final decisions on compensation while the previous quarters accruals attract much attention our fullyear compensation and benefits to net revenues ratio ultimately represents the firms compensation expense in  that ratio was the lowest ever since we became a public company   percent while  total net revenues are only  percent less than the record net revenues that we posted in  total compensation and benefit expense is  percent lower than in  equating to a nearly  billion difference in compensation and benefits expense between the two periods our approach to compensation reflected the extraordinary events of  regulatory reform goldman sachs has pledged to remain a constructive voice and participant in the process of reform and has been forthcoming in recognizing lessons learned and mistakes made we have provided a number of recommendations concerning how large financial institutions should account for their assets how risk management processes can be enhanced and how new regulations can keep pace with innovation given that much of the financial contagion was fueled by uncertainty about counterparties balance sheets we support measures that would require higher capital and liquidity levels as well as the use of clearinghouses for standardized derivative transactions more broadly we support proposals that would improve transparency for investors and regulators and reduce systemic risk including fair value accounting in short we believe that sensible and significant reforms that do not impair entrepreneurship or innovation but make markets more efficient and safer are in everyones best interest during our history our firm has demonstrated an ability to quickly and effectively adapt to regulatory change as an institution that interacts with thousands of entities we benefit from the general elevation of standards and will continue to work towards meaningful changes that improve our financial system our relationship with aig over the last year there has been a lot of focus on goldman sachs relationship with aig particularly our credit exposure to the company and the direct effect the us governments decision to support aig had or didnt have on our firm here are the facts since the mids goldman sachs has had a trading relationship with aig our business with them spanned a number of their entities including many of their insurance subsidiaries and it included multiple activities such as stock lending foreign exchange fixed income futures and mortgage trading aig was a aaarated company one of the largest and considered one of the most sophisticated trading counterparts in the world we established credit terms with them commensurate with those extended to other major counterparts includinga willingness to do substantial trading volumes but subject to collateral arrangements that were tightly managed as we do with most other counterparty relationships we limited our overall credit exposure to aig through a combination of collateral and market hedges in order to protect ourselves against the potential inability of aig to make good on its commitments we established a predetermined hedging program which provided that if aggregate exposure moved above a certain threshold credit default swaps cds and other credit hedges would be obtained this hedging was designed to keep our overall risk to manageable levels as part of our trading with aig we purchased from them protection on supersenior collateralized debt obligation cdo risk this protection was designed to hedge equivalent transactions executed with clients taking the other side of the same trades in so doing we served as an intermediary in assisting our clients to express a defined view on the market the net risk we were exposed to was consistent with our role as a market intermediary rather than a proprietary market participant in july  as the market deteriorated we began to significantly mark down the value of our supersenior cdo positions our rigorous commitment to fair value accounting coupled with our daily transactions as a market maker in these securities prompted us to reduce our valuations on a realtime basis which we believe we did earlier than other institutions this resulted in collateral disputes with aig we believe that subsequent events in the housing market proved our marks to be correctthey reflected the realistic values markets were placing on these securities over the ensuing weeks and months we continued to make collateral calls which were based on market values consistent with our agreements with aig while we collected collateral there still remained gaps between what we received and what we believed we were owed these gaps were hedged in full by the purchase of cds and other risk mitigants from third parties such that we had no material residual risk if aig defaulted on its obligations to us in midseptember  prior to the governments action to save aig a majority of goldman sachs exposure to aig was collateralized and the rest was covered through various risk mitigants our total exposure on the securities on which we bought protection was roughly  billion against this we held roughly  billion in collateral the remainder was fully covered through hedges we purchased primarily through cds for which we received collateral from our market counterparties thus if aig had failed we would have had the collateral from aig and the proceeds from the cds protection we purchased and therefore would not have incurred any material economic loss in this regard a list of aigs cash flows to counterparties indicates little about each banks credit exposure to the company the figure of  billion that aig paid to goldman sachs post the governments decision to support aig is made up as follows  billion for highly marketable us government agency securities that aig had pledged to us in return for a loan of  billion they gave us the cash we gave them back the securities if aig hadnt repaid the loan we would simply have sold the securities and received the  billion of value in that way an additional  billion that aig owed us in collateral from september   just after the governments action through december   this represented the additional collateral that was called as markets continued to deteriorate and was consistent with the existing agreements that we had with aig  billion associated with a financing entity called maiden lane iii which was established in midnovember  by the federal reserve to purchase the securities underlying certain cds contracts and to cancel those contracts between aig and its counterparties the federal reserve required that the counterparties deliver the cash bonds to maiden lane iii in order to settle the cds contracts and avoid any further collateral calls consequently the cash flow of  billion between maiden lane iii and goldman sachs reflected the federal reserve paying goldman sachs the face value of the securities approximately  billion less the collateral approximately  billion we already held on those securities goldman sachs then spent the vast majority of the money we received to buy the cash bonds from our counterparties in order to complete the settlement as required by the federal reserve while our direct economic exposure to aig was minimal the financial markets and as a result goldman sachs and every other financial institution and company benefited from the continued viability of aig although it is difficult to determine what the exact systemic implications would have been had aig failed it would have been extremely disruptive to the worlds already turbulent financial markets our activities in themortgage securitization marketanother issue that has attracted attention and speculation has been how we managed the risk we assumed as a market maker and underwriter in the mortgage securitization market again we want to provide you with the facts as a market maker we execute a variety of transactions each day with clients and other market participants buying and selling financial instruments which may result in longor short risk exposures to thousands of different instruments at any given time this does not mean that we know or even think that prices will fall every time we sell or are short or rise when we buy or are long in these cases we are exec,13.38,1.0
11,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2010,fellow shareholders  was a period of strong performance forgoldman sachs in the context of a challenging yearwe contended with uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy questions about the future of regulation and significant scrutiny of our industry and goldman sachs despite these considerable challenges our results were driven by two related and critical factors  our clients who turned to goldman sachs for advice and execution across a broad set of global businesses and  the focused commitment and dedication of our people to serving our clients needs and to strengthening our culture of teamwork and excellence for  the firm generated net revenues of billion with net earnings of  billion diluted earnings per common share were  and our return on average common shareholders equity was  percent excluding the uk bank payroll tax the sec settlement and the impairment of our new york stock exchange designated market maker rights book value per common share increased  percent during  and has grown from  at the end of our first year as a public company in  to a compounded annual growth rate of  percent over this period the business standards committee when we wrote to you last year few would have predicted what the firm would experience and have to work through in  the sec charge a highprofile congressional hearing and extraordinary press attention punctuated a period of scrutiny and criticism having faced those challenges we also believe that few would have predicted that goldman sachs would execute for our clients and otherwise perform like we have we want to thank our shareholders for believing in goldman sachs our clients for supporting us and our people for their steadfastness and teamwork still we have heard the criticisms loudly and clearly at the very least we must have presented ourselves in a way that made us susceptible to being criticized andas the year progressed it became increasingly clear that there was a disconnect between how we as a firm viewed ourselves and how the broader public perceived our role and activities in the market we recognized this as an opportunity to initiate a process of introspection and thorough selfassessment to consider how we canand should improve through the business standards committee bsc we examined what we do and how we do it aspart of this process we drew on the important input of more than  clients who were surveyed through nonattributable indepth inperson discussions conducted by an independent consulting firm we made recommendations for change spanning client service conflicts and business selection structured products transparency and disclosure committee governance and training and professional development one particular area of interest for our shareholders has been the changes we made in our financial reporting and disclosure first we reorganized our reporting segments to provide greater clarity and visibility on the critical importance of our client franchise and client facilitation to our results second we are supplementing our balance sheet with a more simplified presentation that generally allocates assets to our businesses and shows the firms excess liquidity position third we are describing in greater detail our overall risk management structure culture and processes and lastly we are providing additional disclosure related to credit risk operational risk and capital adequacy more generally we also have increased our engagement with a broad range of constituencies to communicate the roles we play on behalf of our clients and services we provide to support economic growth and opportunity when we look back on  we believe that what will have the most important and lasting impact on goldman sachs and what we will be most proud of is the work of the business standards committee and what it representsa fundamental recommitment to our clients a recommitment to reputational excellence associated with everything the firm does a recommitment to transparency of our business performance and risk management practices a recommitment to strong accountable processes that reemphasize the importance of appropriate behavior and doing the right thing and a recommitment to making goldman sachs a better institution in the life of every institution there are important moments in which its mission and processes can and should be reinvigorated to this end we know our people are already acting on the bscs recommendations and embracing their spirit the work of the bsc and the priority on having the highest quality business standards and practices are a powerful basis from which we are able to focus on the futureto identify the opportunities where we can most effectively serve our clients and use our skills and experience to support our mission of allocating capital in order to fund growth and innovation as we write to you in early  the global economy appears to be improvingrecovery is beginning to take hold while economies continue to face a number of challenges especially in the labor market we are seeing client activity across our businesses picking up many of the ceos we advise around the world are expressing greater confidence in the rate of future growth and are more oriented to making capital expenditures and other investments goldman sachs plays important roles as an advisor and financier to help companies raise capital to grow existing businesses and invest in new ones these roles are part of a process that is at the heart of stimulating economic growth and stability additionally as a market maker and risk manager we help governments corporations and investing institutions buy and sell financial instruments in order to realize their investment objectives as an asset manager we help companies pension funds mutual funds individual investors and others preserve and grow their financial assets in many respects our job is to match the capital of our investing clients  who aim to grow the savings of millions of people  with the needs of our corporate and government clients  who rely on financing to generate growth create jobs and deliver products and services on either side of this equation we often will assume and manage risks from our clients so that they can concentrate on their underlying businesses economies need strong healthy financial institutions to do their critical part to help spur growth and innovation goldman sachs is ready to support and help galvanize capital raising investment strategic planning and more broadly economic activity trends growth and opportunities the global economy financial markets and the financial services industry continue to deal with the significant effects of the financial crisis however we believe it is important to recognize the structural trends that remain unshaken and consider how goldman sachs is positioned so that it can continue to meet our goal of generating industry leading returns while the nature of our business does not lend itself to predictable earnings on a quarterly basis over the long term we remain committed to providing our shareholders with returns on equity at or near the top of our industry while continuing to grow book value and earnings per share goldman sachs ability to address and tap into important economic and financial trends through our roles as advisor financier market maker and asset manager will be critical to fulfilling our mission to help spur growth and perform strongly as a firm these continuing trends include technological advancement certain macroeconomic and demographic developments and the rise of the brics and other growth markets there has also been a necessary and important focus on regulation which will affect the industry at this point however it is impossible to sayto what extent with any degree of precision we believe the core and durable elements of these trends are beneficial and play to the strengths of our firm in the case of financial regulation for example institutions will be required to hold more highquality capital and we are wellpositioned in that regard in considering the rise of the brics rapid income growth and development will power the expansion of the global capital markets our strengths  responding to change nimbly making longterm investments in our global franchise and attracting and retaining talented people  give us the best foundation from which we can position the firm to realize the opportunities that will ultimately emerge regulation the doddfrank legislation and new capital and liquidity requirements under basel  are two of the more significant outcomes from the recent focus on enhancing financial stability given regulatory implementation is only just beginning we dont yet know in detail how the new rules will ultimately impact the industry the broad contours of new regulation however are clear improve the safety and soundness of the global financial system increase the transparency of derivatives markets limit certain investing activities and reduce the consequences of a failure of a large financial institution in terms of the safety and soundness of the financial system basel  guidelines have focused on bolstering the capital and liquidity profiles of financial institutions to better respond to shocks with the global shift towards higher levels of capital and liquidity we believe our conservative financial profile leaves us well positioned to meet new regulatory requirements we have significantly bolstered our basel  tier  common ratio over thepast two years through earnings and capital raises over  percent of our total shareholders equity is in the form of common equity we also continue to maintain a very liquid balance sheet with our global liquidity pool during  averaging  billion or nearly  percent of our total assets while the basel liquidity coverage ratio has yet to be finalized we believe we are comfortably in excess of its minimum requirements we will take advantageof our strong position to continue to invest in longterm growth opportunities and return excess capital to shareholders as appropriate as part of reducing systemic risk relating to the trading of otc derivatives there has been a lot offocus on central clearing platforms we have long been supportive of central clearing because we believe it will improve the safety of the system by reducing counterparty risk  running more derivatives exposures throughthe risk management and multilateral netting ofclearing houses will reduce the risk of firms being too interconnected to fail this also will contribute to greater transparency particularly for regulators while we believe that central clearing platformsare very important it is equally important that they be wellrun with the right risk management governance and regulatory oversight a central clearing housemay reduce counterparty risk it certainly will not eliminate it in fact because clearing houses representa concentration of financial activity they may become an even greater locus for systemic risk if not managed wellexacerbating a problem they were meant to solve and in the end it is the capital of clearing members that ultimately underpins the strength of the clearing house in terms of activity restrictions the volcker rule will restrict proprietary trading activities and many fund investments these businesses historically have not been a substantial driver of the firms performance in response to the new rule we have already liquidated substantially all of the positions that had been held within goldman sachs principal strategies our long short proprietary trading desk and we have commenced the liquidation of the positions that had been held by our global macro proprietary trading desk which traded in the fixed income markets as regulators move to implement the volcker rule it will be important that market making  buyingand selling on behalf of our clients  is not materially impacted if activities essential to market making were to be viewed as proprietary and impermissible then financial intermediaries will be unable to commit their capital which at best would reduce market liquidity and increase the costs of transactions with respect to our merchant bank its core activity  investing for clients  will continue to be integral to our overall strategy as an investment bank we are askedby our clients to be an advisor financier and supplier of equity mezzanine and debt capital we can still meet this client need with investment funds under the volcker rule but with less of our own money invested technology a second critical trend is technological innovation which has had a lasting impact on the structure and efficiency of global capital markets in short technology is a core part of our product offering and client experience our ability to respond quickly and effectively to address our clients needs with customized systems products and services helps differentiate the firm with that in mind it is difficult to overstate the importance of investing in this area technology isour largest division with over  people more than double the size it was in  while there is significant uncertainty over how new regulation will impact individual businesses or market structure more broadly what is certain is that technology will play a central role as such we will continue to focus on building off our bestinclass systems and accelerating the transition of certain businesses to either more hightouch or lowtouch operating models a particular technological competitive advantage for goldman sachs is that we have only one central risk system which is partially a byproduct of not having done multiple major acquisitions that often require merging and retrofitting platforms regulation of the otc derivatives market will drive greater transparency and automation conventional wisdom suggests that greater transparency pressures margins and reduces profitability while transparency can reduce margins it also introduces new opportunities in the form of greater client participation and product innovation both of these trends ultimately drive increased volumes and revenues realizing that no two markets evolve in exactlythe same way we can draw parallels between the current otc derivative markets and our past experiencesin both equities and foreign exchange in the equity markets a series of events began in the late s with changes to nasdaq order handling rules followedby decimalization in  and improvements to price execution and discovery in  over time commission rates and spreads declined and volumes rose significantly we invested in technology to drive operating efficiencies and generate market share gains at the same time our equities headcount declined from peak levels of nearly  during the tech bubble to roughly  today in addition opportunities for new product innovation and tailored hedging solutions for clients are often a function of lower transactioncosts for the underlying instruments we saw similar trends in our fx business where today  percent of interdealer spot fx is traded electronically across a diverse set of execution venues and over the past five years our g franchise volumes have doubled and revenues have increased nearly  percent while headcount is largely flat as a result pretax margins are more than one and onehalftimes higher economic and demographic trends despite the significant upheavals caused by the financial crisis the expansion of the global economy continues our research estimates that global gdp will grow by four percent per annum over the next  years principally driven by growth markets the trend of urbanization also continues for example with  million people projected to move into chinese urban centers by  a growing global middle class will likely result in an increasing demand for commodities not surprisingly there has been a significant expansion of commodity rich economies like the middle east and russia in developed economies like japan aging populations will continue to increase the level of pension assetsin addition pools of capital in sovereign wealth funds in both developed and emerging economies are expectedto grow from  trillion to  trillion of assets inthe next decade these concentrated pools of capital will drive business opportunities for goldman sachs the growth markets we view the brics and other growth markets as oneof the most significant opportunities for our global franchise if one thinks back to the sentiment right after the worst of the financial crisis passed many commentators began to wonder if investors had put too much faith in the ability of growth markets including china to withstand particularly difficult economic conditions in fact some growth markets started to see significant outflows of capital today it is clear that the brics and other growth economies are anchors for the global economy as tumultuous and significant as the financial crisis was we continue to believe that this will be the century of the brics and other growth markets if anything our view of the brics was validated by how well they performed during the financial crisis over the last few years weve generated roughly percent of our revenues from the americas  percent from europe and  percent from asia we believe this revenue mix positions goldman sachs as one of the most diverse of our us peers another way to look at our revenue composition is to differentiate between developed markets such as the us and continental europe and growth markets such as china and brazil while reflecting a higher contribution from growth markets in recent years revenues in the growth markets since  have represented  percent of total firmwide revenues  with much more room to grow we believe that both gdp growth and the relative fiscal stability of many growth countries are trends that should drive revenue opportunities across all of our businesses in china and india income growth and rapid urbanization will drive significant infrastructure demand this projected investment exceeds  trillion in the next decade and much of it can be financed domestically companies in growth markets are also becoming more relevant global players in china for instance the volume of crossborder deals has grown more than five times since  in addition weve seen an extraordinary increase in debt and equity underwriting volumes from growth markets in the past  years as clients seek out financing solutions to support their growth over the past five years weve seen nearly three times the number of capital raisings in india than we saw in the previous  the need to fund growth in china has also created an extremely active local equity market total market capitalization of chinese companies has grown at a compound annual rate of  percent from  through  and its global share is expected to more than double to  percent over the next  years there are almost as many asian companies with one billion dollar plus market capitalization as there are such companies in the us and europe combined stable and growing capital markets also drive opportunities for our market making businesses in latin america the number of our trading clients has increased nearly  times over the last  years finally growth markets contain large and growing pools of capital two hundred of the largest institutions in asia excluding japan manage  trillion of assets but only  percent are current goldman sachs clients growth markets also present important opportunities for our private wealth management business inlatin america alone there are over  families with investable assets in excess of  million similar to developed markets our success in growth markets has been contingent upon our ability to attract and retain strong talent since  our headcountin growth markets has increased by a compound annual growth rate of  percent while our firmwide headcount has grown by only seven percent nearly  people or roughly  percent of our headcount are domiciled in growth markets in  we recruited from  universities in growth markets and  percent of  new hires are from these economies versus eight percent just five years ago we are gratified that goldman sachs continuesto be an employer of choice in these markets and around the world globally in  nearly  percent of the fulltime undergraduates and graduates aswell as summer recruits who received an offer from goldman sachs accepted that offer corporate engagement finally we are pleased to report significant progressover the course of  across our strategic public engagement initiatives taken together these initiatives represent one of the largest corporate philanthropic programs ever size however is not a substitute for impact we believe that these programs will produce positive outcomes over many years we are confident that they will help thousands of individuals to have a better chance of reaching their potential or securing their future they also galvanize our people to act and get involved they represent an effective model of corporate engagement  leveraging the firms skills business and ability to bring different constituencies together and create new partnerships lastly creative and meaningful initiatives help us to recruit and retain talented people who are committed to making a difference in every aspect of their lives  women as we approach the third anniversary of  women the program is today well on its way to providing a business and management education to thousands of underserved women globally binding together a global network of over  worldclass partners and operating in  countries  from china to india from afghanistan to the americas throughout africa and the middle east  over  women have participated in the program to date we are very pleased that  women is having a real impact in the countries where it operates six

evolve as we think about our industry in the last years it has often fought change fearing it was revolution as opposed to evolution the world evolves and for the financial services industry the combination of economic forces regulation and technology will mandate change producing more efficient markets more competitive firms and more resilient economies some will fight change given the uncertainty that comes with it but embracing change early has been fundamentalto goldman sachs success in the last dozen years goldman sachs has responded to a number of developments we went from being an advisor to an integrated larger scale provider of advice financing and coinvestment from a largely domestic firm to a global one from a smaller private firm to a public fortune  company being nimble is a very large part of our cultureand our success story staying close to our clients and listening to their evolving needs reinforces our willingness to accept and adapt to change of course it is impossible to predict the future that is why our enduring commitment to our client franchise and the hard work commitment and collaboration of our people will remain cornerstones of our longterm

12,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2011,we began  encouraged by an increase in client activity greater ceo confidence and early signs that economies were on the mend but soon after experienced new measures of macro uncertainty that ultimately hindered a broadbased recovery challenges facing the euro area advanced from a regional consideration to a global issue leading to concerns about the potential for sovereign defaults contagion and growing skepticism about the willingness of policymakers to address the situation not surprisingly the operating environment led our clients across a variety of businesses to be materially more risk averse the firms perspective on managing its risk exposures mirrored the sentiment of the broader market and consequently our risk exposures remained low in  ultimately the confluence of macroeconomic concerns heightened market volatility lower corporate activity and decreased risk appetite among our institutional clients translated into a fundamentally lower level of revenue opportunities over the course of the year hampering our returns for  the firm produced net revenues of billion with net earnings of  billion diluted earnings per common share were  andour return on average common shareholders equity was  percent for the year excluding the impactof a  billion preferred dividend associated with our redemption of the firms preferred stock issuedto berkshire hathaway diluted earnings per common share were  and our return on average common shareholders equity was  percent throughout the year we continued to manage our liquidity and capital conservatively at yearend the firms global core excess liquidity was  billion and our tier  capital and common ratios under basel  were  percent and  percent respectively while our results suffered as a consequence of global conditions and dampened activity levels we are pleased to report that the firm retained its industryleading positions across our global investment banking client franchise we finished  with one of our best performances as a public company across the global league tables ranked first in worldwide announced mergers and acquisitions ma equity and equity related offerings common stock offerings and ipos given the strength of our client franchise acrossglobal capital markets when economies and markets improve  and we see some encouraging signs ofthis  we are confident goldman sachs will be well positioned to provide further value to our clients and shareholders as we help our clients manage throughthis period we will continue to focus on their evolving needs while prudently managing risk shareholder capital and expenses to generate attractive returns in this years letter we would like to discuss how weare approaching the current operating environment as well as review  through the lens of priorities articulated by our clients  the longterm growth opportunitiesfor goldman sachs we spent more than onehalf of our time last year away from the office meeting with clients around the world through these ongoing discussions we gain a better understanding of emerging trendsthe challenges and goals our clients are focused on and the role we can play to help them taken individuallyand as a whole these interactions are fundamental toour clientdriven strategy we will also share with you the significant progress we have made in implementing the recommendations of our business standards committee and talk about the people of goldman sachs the contribution they make every day on behalf of our clients and the critical role they play in our future success finally we will update you on our corporate engagement initiatives designed to help drive job creation and growth the operating environment in  while each downturn has its unique characteristicsour industry has operated through a number of economic contractions over the past decade or so in each instance we saw more precipitous declines in us growth expectations than what we experienced more recently nevertheless last years weak economic conditions initiated a pullback in our clients strategic objectives and financing demands a slowdown in marketmaking activities and depressed asset values across the investing spectrum from a historical perspective the reduction in our investment banking volumes during  was in many respects in line with the drop we experienced following the internet bubble during  ma declined as ceos worried about execution risk and debt and equity underwriting slowed due to higher volatility across markets lower asset prices and weakness in credit indices resulted in a negative impact on our investing  lending business it is important to note however that losses in our asset portfolio were due to our markto market discipline and are largely unrealized the ultimate assessment of our investing and lending activities must be over a period of years rather than a narrow snapshot risk discipline and returns as we do in all market conditions our approach amidst uncertainty has been to manage our risk levels prudently our adjusted leverage ratio at the end of  was down approximately  percent from the end of  we have further strengthened our liquidity position relative to precrisis levels our average global core excess highly liquid securities and cash instruments is at near record levels up more than twofold from four years ago comprising close to  percent of our average adjusted assets we have also made a concerted effort to reduce our level  illiquid assets which since the end of  are down  percent and represented approximately  percent of our  yearend balance sheet of course as underlying conditions change we will recalibrate our capital and liquidity profile to be in an optimal position to serve our clients and to ensure that we are being strategic in managing the firms financial resources for our investors if client demandfor risk capital remains muted and opportunities to invest and generate attractive returns are scarce we may elect to reduce capital intensive portions of our balance sheet and return excess capital to shareholders through repurchases or dividends since the beginning of  we have repurchasedmore than  billion of common stock or approximately  percent of our common equity relative to  yearend levels we have also bought back the equivalent of close to  percent of the share count issued during the height of the crisis while growing our book valueper common share by a compounded annual growthrate in excess of  percent since the end of  at the same time we have increased our common equity by nearly  percent over this period while maintaining capital ratios near the top of our industry controlling costs in addition we have targeted approximately  billion of annual runrate expense savings in order to function more efficiently and believe we can further benefit from greater operational leverage in terms of infrastructure technology and people in a number of key markets and businesses as we gain a better understanding of where to deploy capital and resources and at what level we will make the necessary adjustments to achieve stronger returns it is important to note that as for many of our clients and financial institutions to varying degrees the costsof conforming to new regulations have been significant at the end of  the firms regulatoryrelated headcount had nearly doubled from prefinancial crisis levels across a variety of functions our regulatoryrelated expenses have also nearly doubled during this period in the shorter term the heightened regulatory focuswill continue to demand considerable effort and expense however over time we expect this trajectory to even out as infrastructure systems and processes are rationalized and we and our regulators have gained greater clarity around final requirements ultimately we hope to see the pendulum come to rest at a point that better reconciles effective oversight with the need to continue driving towards investment and growth we will address other aspects of regulatory reform  particularly as they relate to our clients  later in the letter lastly our focus on cost discipline includes adheringto our pay for performance philosophy in  net revenues were down  percent and compensation and benefits expenses for our people were down  percent with discretionary compensation down significantly more than net revenues over the past few years we have also reduced compensation and benefits to net revenue ratios with our average ratio over the past three years of approximately  percent being materially lower than our average ratio of approximately  percent from  through  our clientdriven strategy more than three years since the onset of the financial crisis many institutions remain focused on working through its aftermath and managing risk in all its forms  whether related to liquidity credit market or regulation lower revenues and more subdued growth forecasts are causing some to question whether the industry is undergoing secular change or more specifically whether the model of providing advice financing market making asset management and coinvesting will continue to be relevant in the future landscape based on what we hear from our clients and the work we do on their behalf put succinctly  we believe the core model remains more viable and important than ever among the forces affecting our industry some are certainly cyclical  such as economic growth corporate activity and risk appetite  and some are secular such as those related to market structure the influence ofthe growth markets technological advancements or the regulatory landscape secular change requires thatover time we evolve and position ourselves in ways that continue to add value for our clients for example many services we provided over the telephone to our equity clients ten years ago are today both priced and executed automatically promoting a more liquid and efficient marketplace for investors similar structural developments have occurred in foreign exchange us treasuries and other areas our commitment of people and resources to growth markets also represents our response to longterm secular demands it may be too early to conclude to what degree the current industry slowdown is secular versus more broadly cyclical in any scenario our strategy remains informed and driven by the insights and demands of our clients around the world and what weve heard consistentlyis that as they respond to the longterm trends of globalization and technology as well as macroeconomic and demographic changes what we do for them is not only still relevant  but critical every day our clients seek advice and financing theylook to us to take the other side of a transaction to help hedge their risk they need an asset manager to invest on their behalf and a coinvestor ready to deploy capital towards promising growth opportunities in short clients look to us for these core client services both through periods of transition and at any stage of the economic cycle time and again in  we saw sentiment shift rapidly confirming that our strategy must always be rooted in the fundamental needs of our clients and in our ability to act quickly and effectively in their service investing in longterm trends comprehensive advice and risk management a more global market has also yielded a more multifaceted and potentially more risky business environment this in turn has put demands on the quality and breadth of services that companies institutions and governments require in order to operate with greater scale for example a client may need to hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations navigate integration issues across borders or manage the volatility of commodity prices to address these types of needs our ability to partner our investment banking franchise with our institutional client services businesses enables clients to benefit from seamless advice and transfer risk directly to the firm to manage importantly it allows our clients to get back to focusing on their underlying businesses and strategic objectives in a similar vein a growing practice among companies is to outsource the noncore or subscale parts of their business in particular we have seen an increase inthe outsourcing of insurance asset management globally which has been accelerated by new capital regimes greater demand as a result of the financial crisis anda sustained low interest rate environment making it more difficult to generate returns since  industry wide growth in outsourced general account assets has more than doubled from  billion to more than  trillion goldman sachs is making a substantial investment in this area having grown these assets by approximately  billion since  representing an over  percent compounded annual growth rate global opportunity set while it is impossible to say how long economies will remain under pressure when more consistent growth does return our revenues tend to grow at a multiple of that growth this drives our efforts to operate in more places  or put another way to chase gdp growth between  and  international revenuesfor dow jones companies grew by  percent while domestic revenue grew by just  percent ftse  companies have seen a similar trend as international revenue grew by  percent compared to a  percent decrease in domestic revenue over the same period this also holds true in crossborder ma with aggregate volumes up  percent from  relative to the four years prior since  crossborder deals represent nearly  percent of overall ma volumes consistent with these themes we see opportunities across a number of regions and businesses driven by client demand as companies have become more global and growth economies have benefited from greater wealth creation market capitalization has also increased chinas market capitalization has tripled as a percentage of world market capitalization from  through  with the us contribution shrinking to  percent of its  levels net revenues from our asia business have more than doubled in  compared with  more than ever our clients seek local expertise and advice in response over the past six years we have hired more than  professionals into countries such as brazil russia india china and korea around the world we now serve  more investment banking clients and approximately  more counterparties within our institutional client services businesses over the same period in the year ahead crossborder ma activity is poisedto continue and grow in europe due to outbound activity from institutions looking to diversify in chinaas clients look for greater access to natural resources and end markets and in japan where companies are seeking external growth prospects with currency exchange rates close to postwar highs emerging markets ma activity is also likely to regain momentum led by inbound activity into brazil which has the most open foreign investment policy among the brics and by enterprises in developing countries seeking brands and sales and marketing expertise which they lack in their home markets we also see market share expansion opportunitiesthe recent retrenchment by some financial institutions especially in europe has the potential to change the competitive landscape european peers have announced plans to lower headcount shed riskweighted assets and exit certain businesses altogether such deleveraging may lead to reduced lending capacity higher new issuances and greater secondary trading creating opportunities for goldman sachs to intermediate asset sales to our investing clients clients and regulatory reform as mentioned the potential impact of regulation has been an important theme over the past few years and certainly in  we are working constructively with regulators around the world to contribute to effective and realistic implementation of new legislation and regulations and remain focused on what reforms may mean for our industry for our firm and most importantly for our clients in many of our conversations clients have expressed concern about the impact their businesses may experience including new margin requirements potentially less market liquidity wider spreads and less available more expensive inventory these and other factors will affect not only howclients serve their customers but also their technological infrastructure legal documentation and compliance areas it is critical for us to understand the issues confronting our clients and to adapt our services accordingly to better meet their needs when rules begin to take final shape we will increasingly allocate resources to developing trading tools and clearing and settlement systems that will help our clients address these new realities more broadly we recognize that translating the statutory language into workable outcomes is challenging and appreciate the effort made by all parties to strike the balance between flexibility and specificity this is especially important with respect to the volcker rule  which restricts banking entities proprietary trading activities and certain interests in and relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds as the process moves forward it is critical that rulemaking proceed in a way that is not counterproductive to the ability of companies and investors to continue to use the capital markets to accomplish their business objectives we believe it is critical that the final version of the volcker rule reflects a meaningful evolution from the one currently under proposal this includes drawing an essential distinction between prohibited proprietary trading and the vitally important  and statutorily protected  marketmaking related underwriting and hedging activities getting these issues right has serious realworld consequences for our clients and other market participants who rely on the vital financial intermediation and capitalraising services that financial institutions such as goldman sachs provide for example if the constraints of the proposed rule define our ability to hedge in a way that makes it prohibitively expensive or so narrowly that effectively prohibits it in some cases our clients will be forced to hold more risk on their own books this will increase the volatility of their earnings and hurt their share prices which in turn will raise their cost of capital reduce their capacity to invest lower their returns to shareholders and diminish their appeal as strategic partners the proposed restrictions on market making could also have wideranging adverse effects for example a company wishing to issue bonds to finance expansion plans or a pension fund looking to sell a stake in its portfolio to fund nearterm obligations may turn to goldman sachs to underwrite or execute the transaction in either case we would typically engage in marketmaking related activities and in doing so may hold some of the assets on our books because market makers are willing to buy from and sell to clients in different market conditions we need to know that we can carry this inventory for the optimal time not a minimal time and have judgments madeby people who are trying to determine an appropriately effective manner in which to dispose of the position if restricted from doing this market makers will provide less liquidity and at worse prices for the bond issuer this raises its cost of capital and for the pension fund this erodes savings raises costs for employers and reduces pension security for the funds participants liquid capital markets are the jewel of americas financial and economic system the benefits of whichare felt by every industry and by all investors reduced liquidity and other inadvertent byproducts of the proposed rule pose obstacles to the free flow of capital and efficient allocation of resources throughout the global economy this is capital that could otherwise go to investment and job creation or be returned to shareholders while the consequences of an overly restrictive application of the volcker rule are formidable we are optimisticthat the intended results can be achieved in a way that will ultimately be better for all constituencies including investors and companies around the world looking to access capital expand and grow to this end we are recommending constructive changes to the proposed rule that would provide a much stronger foundation as market participants and regulators move forward implementation of business standards committee recommendations in january  we released the report of thebusiness standards committee bsc which was the culmination of an extensive eightmonth review across every major business region and activity of the firma significant amount of time and resources last year were devoted to implementing the reports  recommendations over  of our people were directly involved and many more indirectly as the bsc recommendations are integrated into the daytoday operations of the firm to monitor and supervise the implementation process we created an oversight group comprising senior leaders across the firm employee participation in implementation has spanned every level division and region demonstrating the commitment and openness within our organization to improving and strengthening goldman sachs to date our efforts have served to catalyze a renewed focus on client service and client communication on strengthening our controls processes and committee governance on greater personal accountability and reputational risk management and on reinforcing attributes of our culture and values importantly we established the firmwide client and business standards committee which is composed of many of the firms most senior leaders and puts clients at the heart of our approach to governance this includes applying an elevated standard of professional judgment to all aspects of our business activities and in everything we do as nearly every facet of the recommendations has a training component we are implementing over  new bsc training programs and embedding bscrelated content into over  existing training programs in particular the bsc emphasized the importance of articulating clearly both to our people and to our clients the nature of the roles we are asked to undertake across our various businesses whether acting as advisor fiduciary market maker or underwriter as part of the bsc we retained an independent consultant to conduct nonattributable indepth inperson discussions with senior management of a number of clients worldwide among the feedback we received was their desire for us to communicate more clearly the roles and responsibilities we undertake depending on the nature of the transaction and the objectives of the client to this end we implemented the rolespecific client responsibilities framework which does not capture every possible client interaction but is designed to facilitate better communication with clients about our specific responsibilities in a given transaction type or business activity to date over  of our people have taken part in training focused on the different roles and responsibilities we assume in working with our clients a central theme of the training is the need to be clear to ourselves and to our clients about the capacity in which we are acting and the responsibilities we have assumed chairmans forum last year we launched the third iteration of the chairmans forum a global initiative for managing directors designed to emphasize the importance of and our commitment to  reputational excellence and individual accountability structured to incorporatekey bsc recommendations each of the  threehour sessions featured an interactive case study presenting complex and multifaceted scenarios for intensive discussion this deep commitment of time by our senior leadership reinforces the priority we place on weighing reputational risk when making difficult business decisions thinking broadly about individual responsibilities and escalating issues as appropriate our reputation is built upon our service to clients our performance and the integrity of our people each of whom carries with them responsibility for protecting the firms reputation in the judgments actions and communications they undertake ongoing evaluation as formal implementation of the bsc winds down this is not the end of this process but in many respects it is the beginning because the focus of this effort is rooted more in the judgment of our people than a formal rule set for decision making we will also look to multiple sources of feedback  our clients our people regulators and other key stakeholders  to ensure that our commitment to improvement is a living breathing and dynamic process our people notwithstanding the forces of technology and globalization ours is ultimately a human business conducted person to person a client relationship is only as strong as the goldman sachs professionals managing that relationship the most important thing we cando to enhance the value of our client franchise is to continue to retain our people and to hire the most talented individuals from around the world we benefit from committed seasoned leadership across the firms businesses and divisions with an average tenure of over  years for members of our management committee at the same time almost  people applied for fulltime positions at goldman sachs for  and  we hired less than  percent of that population and though most had multiple offers nearly nine out of ten people offered a job with us accepted once they arrive at goldman sachs we do everything we can to ensure they have productive and stimulating careers we go to great lengths to engage our people listen to whats on their minds and where necessary implement changes to ensure we remain an attractive and dynamic place to work this past year we conducted our people survey a biennial effort to solicit thoughts and opinions on how to maintain a strong culture and rewarding environment the  survey garnered more than  comments and suggestions reflecting strong participation from across all levels and offices among the findings our people indicated they remain excited to work at the firm and continue to value our culture of teamwork and also pointed out areas where wecan do better these suggestions and other data will continue to drive our key people initiatives just as they have since we first polled our people in  we are especially pleased that

13,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2012,when we wrote to you last the global economy was experiencing macroeconomic strains punctuated by concerns over potential sovereign defaults in europe and struggling labor and housing markets in the us these concerns weighed on markets and hindered a broadbased recovery while  presented its own challenges amidst rapidly shifting investor sentiment we are pleased to report that goldman sachs performed relatively well posting solid results this performancewas the result of a competitive position defined by our deep and global client franchise a mix of core businesses to which we have demonstrated a longstanding commitment a healthy and strong balance sheet and the focus and enduring commitment of our people to our clientcentered culture for  the firm produced net revenues of  billiona  percent increase from  billion in the prior yearnet earnings of  billion increased by  percent from  billion in  diluted earnings per common share were  up more than three times from  in  our return on average common shareholders equity was  percent book value per common share increased by percent during  and has grown from  at the end of our first year as a public company in  to  a compounded annual growth rate of nearly  percent over this period our capital management in  reflected a prudent approach as our capital ratios improved significantly despite returning  billion to common shareholders through share buybacks and dividends in this years letter we would like to review the economic and market environment in  and discuss the stepswe have taken to differentiate goldman sachs across the competitive landscape to ensure we are poised to seize upon new opportunities as they unfold we then will address our response to structural changes reshaping the marketplace including regulatory change globalization and technology lastly we will provide you with an update on the important work taking place across our corporate engagement initiatives that we believe are making a meaningful difference for many individuals and communities the operating environment in  while the sovereign debt crisis in europe and a weak recovery in the us continued to persist throughout much of  the deep uncertainty that permeated the recent past began to show signs of abating in the second half of the year despite ongoing political ambiguity both in the us and europe generally improving economic data coupled with continued strong central bank actions helped stabilize corporate and investor sentiment the european central bank enhanced its longterm refinancing operations to provide term liquidity at the end of  and affirmed its support for the euro it also expressed its willingness to make outright purchases in the secondary bond market while the potential for instability remains these actions reduced systemic risk across europe in the us the federal reserve continued to take steps to support markets and economic growth while the labor and housing markets produced encouraging signs of stability and even some improvement as corporate and investing clients digested these macroeconomic developments activity levels increased in some areas and remained sluggish in others for example global debt issuance increased by  percent year over year with highyield issuance increasing by  percent conversely global equity underwriting volumes were up only one percent and completed global mergers and acquisitions ma volumes decreased by  percent and remained very lowas a percentage of market capitalization our competitive position for goldman sachs the past few years have been aperiod of both introspection and deliberate action including a comprehensive examination of our business practicesa disciplined focus on costs and how we allocate capital and a renewed sense of the importance of identifying the difference between cyclical and secular trends this last area is especially important to our overall strategic framework we never lose sight of the fact that we are stewardsof an industryleading franchise that was built over nearly  years this means that while we have an obligation to meet the nearterm demands of the current environment in which we operate we need not completely surrender to them nonetheless the cyclical pressures facing our industry are real and we have responded by reducing costs and proactively managing our capital if the environment deteriorates further we will take additional action at the same time we will continue our investment inand commitment to our broad set of institutionally focused businesses that have a track record of providing higher returns than many other businesses within financial services we believe that providing effective advice financing significant transactions and providing liquidity especially in difficult markets will be no less important going forward our focused business model global footprintand culture of teamwork oriented professionals put us in a strong position to meet our clients needs and generate superior returns for our shareholders our focused business model global footprint and culture of teamworkoriented professionals put us in a strong position to meet our clients needs and generate superior returns for our shareholders in addition durable longterm trends such as regulation globalization and technology will continue to have a profound effect on economies and markets and in these areas we have protected our ability to be proactive as we have often stated our businesses do not lend themselves to predictable earnings however over thelong term we are committed to the goal of providing our shareholders with returns on equity at the top of our industry while continuing to grow book value and earnings per share controlling costs a significant element of providing healthy returns is a disciplined focus on expenses our ability to achieve operating leverage was particularly important in  when economic growth remained challenged markets by their construction reflect the natural ebb and flow of economic activity which means moving between periods of expansion and contraction for this reason it should not be surprising that in a period of contraction and uncertainty we would experience lower levels of corporate and investor activity and risk appetite of course we respect cycles which can sometimes last a very long time they can be so consequential that if one does not react early enough you not only forego the benefits of the cyclical upturn but also risk the ability to recover at all with this in mind we announced a  billion expense savings initiative with our second quarter  earnings we subsequently increased that to a runrate of  billion in expense savings as part of our expense initiative our overall headcount was down nine percent over the past six quarters at the same time we have increased the number of people in certain high value locations including bangalore salt lake city dallas and singapore since  the number of our people in these locations has nearly doubled and today represents  percent of the firms population we also have focused on closing certain businesses that are not core have lower returns andor impose excessive capital charges for example we sold our hedge fund administration business which provides various accounting and processing services to hedge funds many of the activities in that business were less central to the services we provide hedge funds through prime brokerage an important business for the firm in another area related to expenses we have demonstrated a strong commitment to aligning compensation with performance establishing a very close relationship between the firms revenue and compensation in short we compensate better in good years and have restricted pay in weaker ones for example in  our net revenues were down percent as a result our compensation and benefits expenses were down  percent in  net revenues rose  percent from the previous year and compensation and benefits expenses increased by six percent our approach to compensation flexibility is also demonstrated through our compensation ratio which has averaged  percent over the past four years  more than six percentage points lower than our average ratio in the four years before the financial crisis last year our compensation ratio was the second lowest since we became a public company opportunities  our client franchise while tactical and strategic actions are always important ultimately our success begins and ends with our clients it is only through ongoing discussions with our clients that we gain a better understanding of emerging trends the challenges and goals that are our clients focus and the role we can play to help them the opportunities we find most attractive are invariably rooted in our fundamental strategy of integrating capital with advice to help our clients meet their nearterm needs and longterm objectives like no other time in recent history access to diversified sources of funding is becoming a strategic imperative andis driving the further development of capital markets in many parts of the world roughly  percent of all corporate funding in the us comes from capital markets activity in europe the situation is nearly the opposite with the bulk of funding coming from bank loans in leveraged finance however  percent of the issuance in europe since  were bonds  compared to just percent in the three years preceding the  crisis we expect that higher capital requirements which we the opportunities we find most attractive are invariably rooted in our fundamental strategy of integrating capital with advice to help our clients meet their nearterm needs and longterm objectives will discuss in greater detail will mean less bank lending and more bond issuance this presents a real opportunity for goldman sachs to engage with and help our clients to secure the funding they need to expand and prosper clients call on us throughout their companys lifecycle when looking for funding when they debut on a public exchange when they face critical decisions such as whether to buy or sell a business line or when they are looking for a business partner that may be halfway around the world in every instance we look to develop the relationship based on the evolving needs of our clients and understand that by focusing on their success our own will follow we are pleased that in  goldman sachs ranked firstin worldwide announced and completed ma as well as in global equity and equityrelated offerings providing liquidity and making markets for our clients hasalso grown in importance at a time when the industrys collective capacity to assume risk has decreased with theexit or downsizing of many of our competitors we believe that our early and longterm investments in both technology and people have allowed us to maintain a firsttier institutional client platform that is being scaled efficiently for increased volumes and reduced transaction costs for our clients secular trends while always mindful of cyclical conditions and potential outcomes we have long been focused on the structural trends that will have longterm effects on economies and the underlying structure of markets regulation globalization and technology are especially significant regulation  capital management new requirements expected under basel   a global regulatory standard on capital adequacy and liquidityrisk  make the efficient use of capital more important than ever basel  will significantly impact the amount of capital attributed to certain businesses riskweighted assets under basel  are estimated to be roughly  percent higher for financial institutions in the us than under basel  as ofthe end of  as the industry awaits greater clarity on the final rules we are carefully managing our riskadjusted capital levels we have a long track record of allocating capital and other scarce resources based on riskadjusted returns providing greater balance sheet and resources to higher return businesses while downsizing or eliminating lower return businesses to assist us in making the right decisions as they relate to capital allocation we have begun to roll out technology that enables us to see capital charges at a granular level  often by individual security we use the software to run analyses when buying or selling securities in our sales and market making businesses in order to understand the capital implications associated with different scenarios by understanding the key drivers of our risk positions our securities professionals can more effectively deploy and manage our capital it also helps us to serve clients better sales professionals can better understand how different clients consume capital through added exposure risk weightings and other contributors to their overall profile managing capital usage more precisely can translate into greater risk capacity for our clients and greater capital efficiency for the firm this provides not only a basis from which to understand and improve returns but also operating leverage when the opportunity set expands while basel  capital rules are not final and not expected to be fully phased in until  we expect that we will ultimately operate with a capital cushion of about  basis points above our regulatory requirement new capital requirements and size  complexity the increase in the cost of capital has been joined by a corresponding rise in the cost associated with an institutions scale for more than a decade larger size and complexity were viewed entirely as synergistic and virtuous however as capital surcharges associated with size and complexity are introduced the costs and barriers to entry in some businesses will be raised and institutions will be forced to be more disciplined about their resource allocation although we have significant scale in each of our businesses many of our investment banking competitors also have sizeable commercial and consumer businesses which will cause them to hold additional capital against their entire balance sheet any synergy from housing multiple businesses together must be weighed against the requirements for more capital and liquidity for the first time it is clear that size and complexity come with a higher cost globalization one theme that we believe will continue to play an integral part in economic growth is globalization among other trends it reflects the emergence of vital new markets across regions of the world as well as the evolution and integration of these economies into the global financial system we continueto expect many of these economies notably the brics to remain on a path to becoming important anchors for the global economy as their financial systems mature crossborder transactions represent roughly onethirdof global volume as companies with large exposure to developed markets continue to look beyond their borders for attractive acquisition targets to enhance growth in addition emerging market companies and investors particularly those in asia and latin america are increasingly looking for value and opportunistic acquisitions in key developed markets in  transactions volumes within the brics represented nearly onefifth of global ma and ipos more specifically we anticipate further reforms in chinas capital markets over the next five years which will meaningfully increase the size of these markets and by extension the opportunity for goldman sachs to play a role in facilitating market activity on behalf of our clients technology technology plays a crucial role in our response to regulatory change as well as in optimizing operational efficiency managing risk and serving our clients the firm has long been a technological innovator helping found archipelago ice tradeweb fxaii and brokertec among other leadingedge marketplaces within our equities business a majority of shares are now traded through lowtouch channels we also are seeing a similar trend in the fixed income markets in the cash fixed income markets electronic execution is well developed representing approximately  percent of the fx spot forward market and nearly  percent of the rates and credit cash markets in derivatives approximately  percent of the liquid credit index market trades electronically in the fx options market the number is ten percent to keep pace with the rapid evolution in electronic trading it is critical that we continue to innovate and create greater operational efficiencies in fact the automation of our backoffice processing has been a natural followon to more electronic trading one example is the migration of our lowtouch equities flow to electronic processing of the flow that has moved over failed trades have declined by more than  percent we expect that over time all lowtouch trades and a significant amount of hightouch trades will be processed digitally as well we also rely on technology to manage risk effectively while judgment remains paramount the speed comprehensiveness and accuracy of information can materially enhance or hinder effective risk decision making we mark to market approximately  million positions every day and we rely on our systems to run stress scenarios across multiple products and regions in a single day our systems use roughly  million computing hours for risk management calculations as a firm our ability to adapt to regulatory change is enhanced from having all of our positions represented onone risk system improving our efficiency and communication not having to manage and integrate different systemsacross our businesses will be critical to taking full advantage of the move to standardization which benefits our clientsand the financial systems transparency and resiliency a legacy and new additionsto our board of directorsafter  years at goldman sachs and  years as chief

important nearly  volunteers across the firm donated their time to help in the immediate and ongoing recovery efforts looking ahead each year as we look to the next we also are promptedto consider our recent past it has been a period of reflection as an organization an opportunity to focus on improving wherever we could to make us a better firm and a timeto think about our future  where we can most help our clients and advance their interests to spur more economic growth and opportunity in  and  our focus was on stabilizing and fortifying the firm amidst the most turbulent days of the global financial crisis in  and  we engaged in a rigorous and comprehensive review of our business practices committed to selfprescribed changes and took aggressive steps to implement them in  while navigating constantly shifting economic and market sentiment we remained true to our core businesses investing in our client franchise and our people heading into  we remain cautious given the everpresent risks and challenges to the markets andglobal economy at the same time we are encouragedby early signs of broadbased improvement whenone considers many of the issues that still weigh on market sentiment  such as the eurozone crisis chinas growth trajectory and fiscal cliff concerns in the us  most are not intractable and will be resolved we believe strongly that goldman sachs is well positioned to realize the opportunities presented by the emerging competitive landscape hopefully more normalized economic growth trajectories and the expanded opportunity set that the confluence of these developments will provide we can achieve these goals by remaining focused on the needs of our clients committed to prudent risk management disciplined with our capital and expenses focused on superior execution and intent on building on our market leading positions our people and the culture they reflectput us in a position to meet these imperatives and in doing so we have never been more confident in our ability to achieve attractive returns and create longterm value forour shareholders ,7.475,1.0
14,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2013,this past year for the global economy may be best described as one of incremental but noticeable improvement in the united states the economic recovery finally began to take hold with continued underlying economic growth and slowly accelerating gains in the labor market in europe while conditions remained broadly difficult we began to see nascent growth and in certain countries such as the united kingdom a more advanced recovery fears of a sharp slowdown in china receded somewhatand the countrys new leadership signaled a more assertive posture on economic and financial reform in japan aggressive fiscal and monetary policies spurred a reinvigorated economic and financial environment at the same time political impasse in the united states for much of the year and uncertainty over central bank policy both highlighted and to some extent contributed to the fragility of the economic recovery as a result many of our clients remained cautious which hindered a broadbased resumption of their business activities amidst these shifting factors we are pleased to report that goldman sachs performed relatively well generating solid results for the year this was the byproduct of our commitment to a core set of businesses and actions we have taken over the last several years in three important areas strengthening our balance sheet allocating capital efficiently across our businesses and managing our costs prudently for  the firm produced net revenues of  billionand net earnings of  billion an eight percent increase from  billion of net earnings in  diluted earnings per common share were  compared with  for  our return on average common shareholders equity roe was  percent book value per common share increased by approximately five percent during  and has grown from  at the end of our first year as a public company in  to  a compounded annual growth rate of approximately  percent over this period our capital management in  reflected a prudent approach as our capital ratios continued to improve despite returning  billion to common shareholders through share buybacks and dividends in this years letter we would like to review the significant steps we have taken in recent years to adapt and respond to the postfinancial crisis world and building on those efforts our priorities for enhancing returns to our shareholders going forward in that vein we also will discuss our competitive position across our major businesses lastly we want to share with you some of the initiatives we undertook related to our people culture and business standards and practices the past year marked the fiveyear anniversary of the global financial crisis later in the letter we will discuss the impact of the changes we have made from the extensive review of our business standards and practices importantly this is also an opportune time to highlight the significant actions the firm has taken over the last five years related to our capital liquidity and overall financial profile to adapt to the realities of the operating and more specifically regulatory environment some of those actions are represented to the right we have focused not only on strengthening our balance sheet but also on ensuring that we are allocating capital efficiently both to meet the needs of our clients and to generate stronger returns going forward new regulation is pushing the industry to be even more sensitive to riskadjusted returns whether through higher capital requirements or the application of stress tests over time this may translate into greater pricing discipline across the entire industry which we view as a positive development well in advance of any regulations being finalized we have been focused on developing and implementing tools to help us better price the provision of liquidity to the marketplace and better manage our capital usage in that regard at the conclusion of  our estimated transitional basel iii advanced common equity tier  ratio was in excess of  percent another important capital management effort that we have undertaken is refining our business mix in light of new capital requirements certain businesses like the americas reinsurance and european insurance businesses no longer generated attractive returns under a basel iii framework and as a result we opted to sell a majority stake in them even with investments such as the longstanding one that goldman sachs had in industrial and commercial bank of china limited icbc which was both strategic and financial we elected to make adjustments given the new capital requirements collectively icbc and our insurance businesses used approximately  basis points of the basel iii advanced common equity tier  ratio and consumed  billion of balance sheet while these are three larger public examples we continue to make riskadjusted return decisions across the firm every day shareholder returns as a firm we have a long track record of delivering superior returns to our shareholders over the cycle we demonstrated this before the financial crisis during it and after if you look at our average roe since the onset of the financial crisisin  we have outperformed each of our us competitors having produced an average roe during this period of more than four times the peer average nevertheless while we have generated solid returns in the last five years they fall below our aspirations we are committed to improving them notwithstanding the challenges presented in the current environment at the same time we want to protect our ability to provide significant upside to shareholders as the economic cycle turns by focusing on revenues expenses and capital efficiency we are building nearterm benefits but also driving material operating leverage into our business our performance over the last few years is an important example of the firms ability to proactively manage a cyclical business and to capitalize on creating operating leveragein our business model in  we announced an initial billion expense savings initiative the size of which was subsequently increased twice ultimately reaching a runrate of  billion in  a  percent increase in net revenues translated into an  percent increase in pretax earnings and a roe expansion to  percent in  despite essentially unchanged net revenues our continued focus on expenses enabled us to grow pretax earnings by five percent and expand roe to  percent longer term we expect that a more robust environment will enable us to deliver even more operating leverage to our shareholders with respect to capital management our strong capital generation and balance sheet management have allowed us to grow our basel iii ratio while returning capital to shareholders since yearend  we have repurchased approximately  billion of our shares and reduced our basic share count by approximately  million shares or  percent while our us peers taken together actually showed an average increase in share count our approach drives shareholder value through both higher returns and growth in earningsper common share controlling costs in addition to effective capital management we are acutely focused on expense management as a lever for driving incremental shareholder returns from  through  our average compensation and benefits expense to net revenues ratio was approximately  basis points lower than the average ratio from  to  compensation and benefits is our largest expense and we remain committed to paying for performance in lower net revenue years like  and  we demonstrated significant flexibility in our compensation and benefits expense in years with net revenue growth this expense generally increased at a lower rate than net revenues thereby driving operating leverage and enhancing shareholder returns the firm remains committed to operating efficiently forour shareholders while providing worldclass service to our clients of course maintaining discipline around costs requires making tough decisions regarding staffing levelsand compensation we have strived to get the balance right between improving shareholder returns and investing in the future of our client franchise to do so we have leveraged technology adjusted our allocation of resources and managed both compensation and noncompensation expenses our expense savings initiatives included enhancements in technology and greater geographic diversity in our workforce currently we have approximately  staff or roughly percent of our workforce located in bangalore salt lake city dallas and singapore compared with  percent in  additionally  percent of all campus and experienced hires since  have been hired into those offices we were among the first global banks to embark onan expense savings initiative and although painful the exercise was necessary being an early mover allowed ongoing recognition of savings over the past two years and protected returns in what continues to be a challenging operating environment growth and the state of our client franchise while we have strengthened our balance sheet prioritized efficient capital allocation and taken a disciplined approachto costs we have continued to invest in a broad set of institutionally focused businesses that have a track recordof providing higher returns than many other businesses within financial services because of a consistent focus on our clients needs and orienting our businesses to meet their ongoing objectives we believe we have provided solid returns in a challenging period while seeking to protect our ability to provide significant upside to our shareholders as the economic cycle turns we believe our businesses are particularly well positionedfor the time when broadbased growth resumes and we see reasons to be confident in the fundamentals of the global economy while emerging markets typically entail higher risk and volatility we believe that over time they will generate stronger growth as the middle class in those countries expands and consumption and investment trends evolvein developed economies greater ceo confidence isdriving more strategic acquisitions as more companies are committing to longer term growth plans investor sentiment has also rebounded and more companies are taking advantage of a better operating environment to raise equity and debt in the us the process of ending quantitative easing has begun and while unsettling for certain markets the move to a more normalized market environment is necessary and ultimately reassuring all of these trends play to the strengths and position of our businesses investment banking investment banking not only includes our advisory and financing services it also serves as an important source of opportunities for all parts of the firm for example working with clients in our financing business often drives demand for hedging solutions while our advisory franchise can create opportunities for coinvestment with our business partners we continue to demonstrate outperformance in our advisory franchise in  we ranked first in both announced and completed global mergers and acquisitions our equity underwriting franchise was equally strong in ranking first in global equity and equityrelated offerings common stock offerings and initial public offerings ipos we served as bookrunner on eight of the ten largest ipos for the year the technology sector was especially active and goldman sachs was the leadleft bookrunner for nearly twice as many technology ipos in the us than the next most active underwriter in debt underwriting we had our best year ever in net revenues while we believe that we could further strengthen our league table position we do not aim to be ranked first in this business despite our natural desire to be ranked at the top of any league table we believe achieving that positionin this case would require a significant increase in lendingat rates that would ultimately dilute longterm returns our approach could change to the extent that regulatory changes drive more attractive pricing more broadly the past year represented one of our strongest market share performances in our advisory and underwriting franchises since  institutional client services in institutional client services our equities franchise isbuilt on the premise of providing a broad suite of servicesto our investing clients this means having a stateoftheart electronic platform comprehensive prime brokerage services and the capacity to be an effective liquidity provider forour clients it also means leveraging our global technology platform to have a scalable high touch and low touch approach to meeting our clients needs it is not sustainable to have only one approach if your goal is to serve a diverse set of clients and to produce strong returns clients determine how they engage the firm and they are increasingly looking to transact electronically with us in both cash and derivative products the longterm demand however for product innovation and high touch services remains so our ability to offer unique solutions across equities products continues to be criticalto our clients this dual approach of high touch and low touch is a byproduct of the many market structure and regulatory changes in the equity markets over the past  years our ability to adjust to a changing regulatory environment has been critical to maintaining a leadership position within our equities business this is also true in fixed income currency and commodities client execution ficc we maintain a leading position across a broad range of products and geographies witha focus on being responsive to our clients needs there is considerable discussion about the outlook for ficc given the numerous regulatory changes taking place and the lower client volumes we remain committed to our ficc businesses which here again reflects the value our clients place on the services that we provide in these markets and our commitment has allowed our client franchise to grow over the past three years for example the number of corporate and growth market relationships have each grown by approximately  percent some of our competitors may elect to deemphasize or exit some ficc businesses given their particular circumstances but we believe this is likely to increase the value that clients place on the services provided by those who remain especially as broader economic activity rebounds and the trading environment improves the past year represented one of our strongest market share performances in our advisoryand underwriting franchisessince  for our ficc businesses providing liquidity to our investing clients requires us to take risk and as a consequence ficcis the largest consumer of our capital our commitment to these businesses does not mean that we havent taken significant action regarding how we utilize capital we have meaningfully reduced riskweighted assets in ficc and are very focused on managing it for riskadjusted returns chasing revenue market share within ficc businesses can lead to risk management lapses and inferior returns focusing on the right balance between risk revenue and returns has been important to building a leading global franchise and consistently delivering strong returns for our shareholders investment management with total assets under supervision surpassing a record trillion dollars our investment management business isone of the largest in the world we have a strong position across a diverse set of products spanning all major asset classes and geographies and despite the challenging market environment we have been able to grow longterm assets under supervision by  percent since the beginning of  additionally we have expanded our defined contribution franchise with approximately  billion in new assets from our acquisition of dwight asset management and our pending acquisition of deutsche banks stable value business like our other businesses success in investment management is a function of performing for our clients our assetweighted mutual fund performance has been above the industry average for nine consecutive quarters through  twothirds of our mutual fund assets were ranked in the top two quartiles by morningstar across one three and five year performance periods as performance has improved so have asset inflows we had net sales in longterm assets under supervision of  billion the highest since  which were broadly distributed across our three key client channels highnet worth individuals thirdparty distributed and institutional this focus on performance has been a critical component in generating our highest net revenues for investment management since  investing  lending investing  lending includes direct investing our investing through funds as well as lending to both corporations and highnetworth individuals our investing activity including coinvesting with our clients has established itself as an important complement to our other franchise businesses we have a history of strong investment performance over the years and that reputation along with deep client relationships have allowed us to invest in opportunities that are not available to others our debt investments are driven by senior loan and mezzanine investments and our direct financing and lending businesses our investing  lending business includes approximately billion of direct loans primarily extended to corporate clients and highnetworth individuals our equity investments include private equity funds direct equity investments and hedge fund investments the volcker rule which we will discuss in more detail limits our ability to invest in hedge funds and private equity through a fund structure as such for some time now in anticipation we have been redeeming our hedge fund investments to be compliant while weve been actively harvesting our private equity funds solid asset price performance has kept balance sheet levels relatively flat our investing and lending activities are synergisticwith our other activities and are valuable to our clientswe remain committed to these businesses and now with greater regulatory clarity we know that with the necessary adjustments we will continue to work with our clientsas an investor regulation in december regulators passed the final volcker rule which restricts banking entities proprietary trading activities and certain interests in and relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds throughout the rulemaking process we stated that it was critical that the rulemaking proceed in a way that is not counterproductive to the ability of companies and investors to continue to use the capital markets to accomplish their business objectives importantly the final volcker rule explicitly permitted market making lending and investing on balance sheet regulators allowed these activities because financial intermediation plays an essential role in capital raising and risk management supporting broader economic activity and growth as we indicated earlier while the rule was only recently finalized we have been preparing to comply with certain portions of the rule for nearly three years we liquidated substantially all of our proprietary trading positions specifically our principal strategies and our global macro proprietary positions and in  we announced our intention to redeem certain hedge fund investments since then we have redeemed approximately  billion of hedge fund investments and we will continue to redeem our interests we are now focused on ensuring that we are in the position to effectively and efficiently comply with the requirements of this new and significant legal regime our people the quality and breadth of our client franchise are a direct byproduct of our ability to attract and retain highcaliber professionals as an investment bank our main asset isour people and the advice and solutions that they provide to our clients great people build great relationships and we are fortunate to have a diverse group of young people from around the world who continue to view goldman sachs asa great place to begin and sustain their careers for our latest analyst class more than  candidates applied for  positions we accepted about four percent of those applicants and of those receiving offers more than  percent accepted in  we were proud to be named as one of fortune magazines  best companies to work for goldman sachs is one of only five companies to be recognized every year that the great place to work institute has issued its list since  of course we operate in a global and competitive industry and we seek to attract from the broadest pool of talented the quality and breadth of our client franchise are a direct byproduct of our ability to attract and retain highcaliber professionals people available it is incumbent upon us to ensure that we are always adapting to the realities of a workplace especially one now shaped by instant connectivity this past year we closely examined the daytoday work environment for junior bankers and its connection to longterm career development after that review we announced a series of initiatives so that these young professionals receive more regular feedback and career development guidance more time with their managers and clients and more consistent and predictable periods when they can plan to be out of the office we also are using new technology that will make the process of creating client related materials easier the goal through these initiatives is to recognize the difference between untargeted effort and productive work our measures of success will continue to be the quality of thought and work we do for our clients something that is sustainable only in a workplace that emphasizes productivity over the expectation of hours in the office and greater balance in pursuit of a longterm career business standards  practices as we have written to you in the past we have spent enormous time and effort as a firm reviewing and improving our business standards and practices in january  we published the report of the business standards committee bsc which was the culmination of an extensive eight month review encompassing every major business region and activity of the firm the report made  recommendations for change in the above areas in january  we established the bsc implementation oversight group which for the next two years was responsible for overseeing the implementation of each recommendation by february  all  recommendations had been fully implemented in may  we released another public report the business standards committee impact report which discussed the changes we made as a result of the bsc implementation and how they impacted our firm we identified three unifying themes across the  recommendations which capture the areas of greatest change and impact on the firm clients and the higher standard of care we apply in serving them  reputational sensitivity and awareness and its importance in everything we do and  the individual and collective accountability of our people most significantly for all our employees the experience of initiating approving and executing a transaction for a clientat goldman sachs is now fundamentally different this difference reflects significant changes to processes business standards documentation and transaction approvals all of which impact our approach to decision making process matters and the bsc changes have led to our processes being more clear comprehensive and consistent business standards reflect the heightened scrutiny we bring to our own actions and activities the role we play as a large financial institution and the responsibilities we have to our clients and to global financial intermediation documentation supporting our processes is more standardized and organized around escalation procedures transaction approvals focus on the core goals of serving our clients longterm interests and protecting the firms reputation taken together these changes result in better judgments and decision making which are among the most important impacts emerging from the bsc the work underlying the bsc is part of a much larger ongoing commitment by the firm to be selfaware to be open to change and to learn the right lessons from recent experiences going forward we know we will inevitably make mistakes but we commit to learn from them and respond in a way that meets the high expectations of our clients shareholders other stakeholders regulators and the broader public on our web site in addition to the two reports you can view other relevant material including a discussion on the impact of the client and business standards committee an illustrated example of the life cycle of a client transaction and video excerpts from the chairmans forum which was a series of internal discussions led by senior management on how we conduct ourselves in serving our clients and protecting the firms reputation corporate engagement in  goldman sachs committed more than  million to

to reach more highpotential women entrepreneurs around the world through the capital this partnership will raise women entrepreneurs will have a much greater chance of reaching their full potential looking ahead in our shareholder letter to you for  we wrote thatwe are always cognizant that conditions can change quickly and in unforeseen waysone of the worst things we could do as a firm and as individuals is to begin to believe that the laws of economics do not apply to us  that somehow markets arent cyclical much of the last five years has been challenged by the cyclical downturn we believe that the upcoming year may very well represent the progression into a stronger global economy but this has not been a passive exercise the banking sector especially in the us is well capitalized companies are operating with strong balance sheets new ways to tap sources of energy are making us manufacturing more competitive the housing market is recovering and individuals have significantly reduced their debt in addition the tail risks in europe and the political impasse in washington dc appear less likely than a year ago collectively we have made a lot of progress of course concerns about emerging economies the effect of the federal reserves taperand a host of other issues may challenge sentiment and complicate the recovery as we look at the longer term fundamentals however we remain optimistic for goldman sachs our businesses are well positionedand our client franchise is strong we have taken important actions to manage efficiently our capital and cost structure as a result we are confident that we have achieved significant operating leverage for our shareholders which will become only clearer with an improving economic environment our culture of teamwork and client focushas never been more alive and vibrant and continues to define who we are and the work we do we remain intent on learning from the experience of recent years but maintain a firm eye on the future to do our part to contribute to economic growth and opportunity in the process weare confident that goldman sachs will produce significant value for our shareholders ,8.04,1.0
15,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2014,for much of the last year the global economy grew in fits and starts in the united states the economic recovery accelerated evidenced by a steadily improving labor market in europe challenges remained pronounced as growth was constrained and in asia conditions slowed in both china and japan different countries are clearly at different stages of the economic cycle and the interconnectedness of these economies has made the transition to growth somewhat extended choppy and oftentimes unpredictable as a result client activity was uneven across regions and asset classes ceo confidence improved and merger and acquisition ma volumes in particular rebounded however client volumes remained generally lower across our institutional client services business despite uneven conditions we are pleased to report that goldman sachs performed well generating solid results for the year our performance benefited from the strength of our global client franchise diversity of our largely institutional set of businesses and our culture of adaptability for  the firm produced net revenues of  billion and net earnings of  billion a five percent increase from  billion of net earnings in  diluted earnings per common share were  compared with  for  our return on average common shareholders equity roe was  percent book value per common share increased by seven percent during  and has grown from at the end of our first year as a public company in  to  a compounded annual growth rate of approximately  percent over this period our capital management in  reflected a prudent approach as our capital ratios continued to improve despite returning  billion to common shareholders through share buybacks and dividends in our previous letter to shareholders we discussed our focus on driving returns in a challenging macroeconomic environment at the same time we emphasized the need to protect our ability to provide significant upside to our shareholders as the economic cycle turns the basis for meeting these goals rests on a strong financial profile and a sustained operating discipline our capital and liquidity levels help ensure stability during periods of market stress and position the firm to add value to our clients when they need it most and generating operating efficiency has bolstered our capacity to improve returns consistently despite the lackluster operating environment of recent years against this backdrop in this years letter we would like to review our financial strength and the benefits embedded in our business model we will also discuss our operating strategy in the recent environment and our major businesses with a focus on their competitive positions and opportunities for growth finally we will update you on our efforts to protect and sustain our culture of client focus and teamwork as well as the important progress being made across our corporate engagement initiatives financial profile since the end of  our balance sheet is down by nearly onequarter while our common equity is up  percent as a result gross leverage has been cut by more than onehalf our liquidity is approximately three times higher than the end of  representing more than  percent of our total balance sheet at the end of  and less liquid level  financial assets are down nearly  percent over this period as represented in the charts on the right our balance sheet measures have improved across the board as a result we have demonstrated our ability to meet or exceed the requirements of various regulations including basel iii capital the supplementary leverage ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio the combination of a solid financial foundation and a focused operating strategy provides the ability to adapt quickly our balance sheet is less than onehalf the size of the peer average and our total staff level is less than  percent of the peer average we are an institutional client firm with a broad range of services our retail clients are largely highnetworth individuals with an average account size of more than  million in short we are not simple but we are simpler our strong and stable financial footing has given us the wherewithal to stay committed to our core set of businesses over the cycle we work with tens of thousands of companies institutions investing entities governments and highnetworth individuals around the world partly because we have remained focused on executing our strategy through our core businesses we have grown our client franchise over the last several years institutional client services for example has seen an approximately  percent increase in active clients since  our mix of businesses reflects the diverse needs of our clients and the products and services we provide produce a diverse and balanced revenue stream in addition to better revenue stability we have benefited from a variable cost structure we have long had a pay for performance culture the bottom chart depicts the strong correlation between the firms performance and its levels of compensation and benefits expense to us this graph underscores the value of a true partnership culture culture is not preordained or guaranteed in perpetuity since we became a public company we have invested an enormous amount of time and resources to sustain our culture rigorous partner selection and aligning compensation with longterm performance reinforce an ethos of longterm ownership the combination of a diverse set of businesses effective risk management and a pay for performance culture has produced a track record of lower earnings volatility than our peers from  through  goldman sachs net earnings to common volatility averaged roughly  percent vs  percent for peers our relative earnings stability is critical to our ability to outperform throughout the cycle we performed when conditions were challenged and we also performed when the environment was more favorable against the backdrop of relatively consistent revenues we have performed well across several key metrics compared to  earnings per share is  percent higher book value per share is  percent higher and our common stock dividends per share have grown  percent over this threeyear period we have returned  billion via share repurchases while maintaining stronger capital ratios net revenues were roughly flat over the past three years but thats not the story since  we undertook several strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations including higher capital requirements we sold a majority stake in both our americas reinsurance business and our european insurance business  and we liquidated our investmentin the industrial and commercial bank of china we also sold our hedge fund administration business and our redi platform in  these businesses and investments produced  billion in net revenues so on a likeforlike basis net revenues in  were about  billion higher than  investment management and investment banking contributed  billion to this growth we have grown revenues while managing expenses and capital our average compensation and benefits to net revenues ratio from  through  was more than  basis points lower than it was from  through  despite a tougher revenue environment we have been equally focused on capital efficiency we have developed technology to help inform our capital allocation decisions the combination of our profitability and risk management allowed us to pay out roughly  percent of our net earnings to common shareholders since the beginning of  and basic share count has declined by percent since the end of that year since the end of  our basic share count is seven percent lower while our common equity is actually more than seven times higher these efforts not only protected nearterm returns they have also positioned the firm to benefit from operating leverage when the environment improves as the cycle turns our strategic focus shifts to growing revenues and the ability to deliver greater operating leverage to our shareholders through margin expansion in that vein we want to review our businesses and opportunities investment banking in investment banking we have the preeminent client franchise we advised on more than  trillion of announced transactions last year the highest level since  we have maintained a leading market share over the last  years we maintained our market position when ma activity was dominated by technology in  by financials in and by natural resources in  and we have maintained our position when volumes were low and when they were higher our performance carries through to different industries market environments and regions our success is rooted in decades of investment consistency of coverage and a broad client franchise by both industry and geography we see a number of growth opportunities on the horizon global economic growth continues to be the biggest driver of the opportunity set in  global ma volume as a percentage of market capitalization was roughly  basis points below the year average returning to the historical average would drive  billion of incremental ma volume we are particularly wellpositioned for growth in crossborder activity given our global footprint and we believe that the demand for funding and capital remains highly correlated to economic growth and broader corporate activity institutional client services in institutional client services we benefit from havingboth a leading fixed income franchise and a leading equities franchise and we have a global footprint while having a diversified mix of businesses supports revenue stability it is also crucial to driving stable and attractive margins we also have a balance of activities and products that are high capital and low capital intensive institutional client services is one of our most dynamic businesses it has always been in a state of evolution the introduction of new regulations has accelerated the evolution in certain areas including market structure as a consequence the value placed on adaptability and operational excellence has significantly grown regulatory requirements and technological investments have raised the barriers to entry higher than at any other time in recent history this is an expensive business to be in if you dont have the market share and scale consider the numerous business exits that have been announced by our peers as they reassess their competitive positioning and relative returns longer term we believe that the value being placed on liquidity provisioning is likely to grow especially in the context of a more rational marketplace this provides an opportunity for market share expansion for those firms with strong global and stable client franchises technological innovation will continue to be important and may increasingly become a differentiator amongst competitors and a potential driver of new or incremental revenues going forward we believe that these requirements will likely lead to only a handful of players being able to effectively compete on a global basis investing  lending another core part of our mission and strategy is to provide promising businesses with the capital they need to grow sometimes that means offering a loan and other timesit means making an equity investment we are able to leverage our global investor network and invest alongside these clients in industries that create jobs and promote economic growth these loans and commitments include major infrastructure projects clean energy and technology companies and cuttingedge healthcare businesses including our own commitments during  we closed on more than  billion of debt and equity capital raised in private equity and credit funds our ability to provide equity capital has been important to growing companies we have a diversified portfolio of  fees generated through the management of client assets in such funds are included in investment management  performance calculated using periodend data for global longterm fund assets nonmoney market for all share classes ranked by morningstar companies which helps drive strong performance forboth our coinvestors and shareholders for example between  and  our private equity and credit funds distributed more than  billion and generally our coinvestors are clients of the firm whether it is with investment banking institutional client services or investment management we will continue to invest and grow our existing investment strategies at the same time we will seek growth in new regions and across new strategies lending has become an increasingly important part of our strategy as it relates to corporate real estate and private wealth clients our private wealth commitments and lending portfolio has been a particular source of significant growth the portfolio benefits from both the level of collateralization and the fact that borrower credit quality for our average private wealth client is extremely high we see an opportunity to continue to grow our lending activities in ways that are accretive to current returns since  weve made great strides in this business growing lending by roughly  percent as we grow we maintain our same conservative and rigorous risk management policies to ensure quality and prudence investment management we have made significant progress in our investment management business over the last few years assets under supervision have grown  percent since  to nearly  trillion at the end of  still we are only the thlargest asset manager globally so there is significant room for growth within fixed income products we are approximately  percent of the size of the largest peer within equities products we are about onequarter of the size of our largest competitor and for alternatives we are approximately twothirds the size of the largest peer we remain focused on delivering strong performance for clients which has already driven meaningful growth at the end of last year  percent of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a year basis and  percent ranked in the top two quartiles on a year basis in  investment management attracted over  billion in feebased assets organically we also see attractive opportunities to expand our private wealth management platform among the distinguishing characteristics of this franchise is its connectivity to our investment banking efforts which serves as an important sourcing mechanism for example the opportunity for our private wealth clients to invest in facebook and uber originated from a banking relationship we continue to invest in longterm strategic initiatives like advisory defined contribution insurance and private banking we have also looked for accretive acquisitions having recently bought deutsche asset  wealth managements stable value business and dwight asset management performing for our clients and expanding our product offerings will help support continued growth going forward our people this year we marked our th anniversary as a firm over that time our people and culture have helped define our success we place a huge priority on

16,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2015,a s many of you know first hand  was a tale of two halves the first half of the year featured a strong operating environment but headwinds emerged particularly during the second half and these headwinds persisted into early  the first two quarters of  were marked by heightened demand from our corporate clients for strategic advice and financings strong client activity across our equities franchise and growing demand from our investment management clients for our products and services these factors culminated in record firsthalf results in investment banking and investment management as well as the best firsthalf performance for equities in six years as the year progressed increasing concerns about china the first rate hike from the us federal reserve in nearly a decade slowing global growth and falling commodity prices  especially in oil  began to emerge we faced these headwinds and lower client activity across many of our businesses suggested that our clients and peers also faced their share of challenges in addition to the impact of the operating environment our  financial performance was negatively affected by the resolution of our most significant outstanding legal exposure relating to our securitization underwriting and sale of residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs from  to  in january  we announced an agreement in principle with the rmbs working group under which we will pay a  billion civil monetary penalty make  million in cash payments and provide  billion in consumer relief despite these factors our strong and diversified client franchise allowed us to produce relatively stable net revenues in  the firm generated net revenues of  billion marking our fourth consecutive year of roughly  billion in net revenues net earnings were  billion and diluted earnings per common share were  return on average common shareholders equity roe was  percent for  which would have been  percentage points higher excluding the provisions we recorded during the year related to the rmbs working group settlement in this years letter to our shareholders we cover a wide array of topics including an overview of our financial profile a review of our strong and diverse client franchise as well as our thoughts on the forward outlook particularly how we are thinking about navigating these uncertain times financial profile as we manage our financial profile our strategy is predicated on carefully delineating between structural and cyclical factors affecting our businesses accordingly in  we continued to adjust our franchise to address structural changes in the regulatory environment andwe will continue to do so as needed from a cyclical perspective it certainly feels like the cycle has been prolonged particularly as interest rates in many partsof the world remain at  or even below  zero and growth and deflation concerns among other worries have persisted it is important to remember that cycles do turn even if the timing of such inflections may be difficult to predict as we look to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term our focus continues to be on managing to both the structural and cyclical forces we see at play while remaining flexible enough to capture future growth opportunities our efforts in this regard have yielded solid results over the past four years we have diversified our franchise while holding net revenues steady we have increased our capital and liquidity decreased our risk and have stayed focused on efficiently and prudently managing our resources  all while helping our clients to execute their longterm goals and strategic objectives over the same fouryear period we returned approximately  billion in capital to our shareholders increased dividends per common share by  percent and reduced our basic share count by  percent in response to structural changes resulting from new regulations since the end of  we have reduced our balance sheet by approximately onequarter while nearly doubling common shareholders equity  cutting gross leverage by more than  percent  and tripling our liquidity position to almost  billion these measures have strengthened our longterm financial safety and soundness also as a result of structural changes we have embraced opportunities to sell businesses and investments that were not core to our client franchise and were no longer the best use of shareholder capital relative to the returns the loss in net revenues due to these sales has been offset by growth in our investment banking and investment management businesses last year these two businesses accounted for  percent of our net revenues compared to only  percent in  investment banking was approximately onehalf the size of fixed income currency and commodities client execution ficc four years ago today our business mix is more balanced this does not mean we are moving away from ficc rather we remain committed to meeting the needs of our clients while managing to structural and cyclical headwinds for example we have reduced riskweighted assets within ficc significantly over the past four years largely in response to structural changes resulting from new regulations on the cost side we have continued to find ways to improve our operating efficiency headcount acrossthe firm is up  percent over the last four years largely to meet regulatory compliance needs however through a combination of shifting to a greater percentage of junior employees and relocating some of our footprint to lowercost locations we have managed ourexpenses well more specifically we have increased the number of analysts associates and vice presidents at the firm by percent since the beginning of  while our partner and managing director populations have decreased by two percent approximately  percent of our total staff is now in lowercost locations such as salt lake city dallas irving warsaw singapore and bengaluru asa result while total staff levels are up over the fouryear period overall compensation and benefits expenseshave declined by approximately  million looking ahead we will continue to pursue ways to be more cost effective by assessing our expense structure while ensuring we meet the needs of our clients whether we are adjusting to structural or cyclical dynamics we will carefully balance our expense management efforts against our ability to capture future market share and growth opportunities investment banking our leading investment banking franchise allowed us to capture significant market share in  the business achieved its secondhighest net revenues in  driven by a strong environment for mergers and acquisitions ma industrywide volumes for announced ma transactions increased by more than  percent in  while the firms volumes increased by approximately  percent we ended the year ranked first in global announced and completed ma with completed ma volumes that were more than  billion higher than our nextclosest competitor  a record gap since the firm went public by most measures  was a robust year forma however volumes as a percentage of market capitalization are still below priorcycle peak levelswe see this as a sign that there is still some room to run for ma activity particularly when equity markets show signs of sustained stabilization we also see consolidation opportunities in sectors such as industrials energy mining food media and telecommunications while total underwriting revenues declined in we performed relatively well in the context of softer equity and debt markets in the second half of the year we finished  ranked first in global equity and equityrelated and common stock offerings similar to the dynamics we see in the ma market we believe there may be pentup demand among our corporate clients to tap into public equity markets when conditions improve particularly given that private financing conditions have generally tightened a decline in debt underwriting net revenues in  was largely due to a drop in leveraged finance activity institutional client services in the wake of balance sheet restructurings in theus and elsewhere we remain one of the few financial institutions with leading global franchises in both ficc and equities we view this as critical to the longterm success of our institutional client services businesswe expect our ability to offer our clients a broad suite of services to be a key competitive advantage in the years ahead over the course of  within ficc lower levelsof client activity in credit and mortgage products were partly offset by stronger client activity and a more favorable backdrop for macro products particularly in interest rates and currencies equities benefitted from a better market environment posting solid results for the year clients continued to place significant value on the integration of our various services across equities  electronic cash derivatives and prime brokerage  as well as our global footprint all of which was reflected in our performance in these areas moving forward addressing structural changes in our institutional client services businesses such as risk based capital rules will remain a central focus for our management team at the same time we will look for ways to advance our franchise in the evolving landscape competitor retrenchments in the wake of structural developments should provide an opportunity for us to capture market share over the longer term as it pertains to cyclical trends in institutional client services we continue to carefully scale our business relative to the environment but have also chosen to remain targeted in our efforts our business is highly correlated to economic growth and when a better opportunity set eventually presents itself  and it will  our strong deep and broad client franchise should position us well to respond investing  lending our investing  lending business enhances and expands our client relationships it creates synergies for our broader client franchise because it enables us to extend credit or to invest alongside our clients from a broader perspective by participating in investing  lending in a disciplined manner we engage in the capital allocation process which allows corporates and individuals to put capital to work to generate broader economic growth over the past several years the composition of investing  lending has changed significantly since the beginning of  we have seen lending increase threefold primarily to private wealth management and corporate clients our corporate loan portfolio is well diversified with no one sector representing more than onequarterof the portfolio our private equity portfolio similarly reflects the diversity of our global client franchise comprising more than  different investments globally across a broad spectrum of industries in some cases we invest in private companies alongside our clients in other cases we invest in public equity or in real estate or we deploy capital to seed new funds while the nature of our investing may change over time due to regulatory changes and net revenues can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on price movements we evaluate the performance of our investing  lending portfolio over many years on that basis these activities have been strong contributors to returns over the last four years investment management our investment management business is one of onlya few such franchises globally that can meet the needsof a broad spectrum of clients across many products and regions we serve investors of all types including retirees in need of mutual funds entrepreneurs who have sold their companies and pension fund managers who need help with asset allocation with this in mind we built our business to be global broad and deep and to focus on delivering consistent returns over time we believe that our emphasis on providing the best possible advice products and services will help us outperform the industry over time executing on this strategy we have experienced significant growth in our business over the past several years we ended  with a record  trillion in assets under supervision up from  billion at the start of  this growth has been the direct resultof robust net inflows driven in part from market share gains as clients place increasing value on asset managers like us that offer a broad array of products and services in  our  billion in organic longterm net inflows outperformed our largest active management peersin some areas of asset management we are still small relative to the market leader as we look ahead this means we see opportunity to grow substantially  both by continuing to gain market share in our incumbent businesses and by expanding into new ones our growth in assets under supervision has also come from new products and several strategic acquisitions we have launched a handful of new products thathave added more than  billion to our assets under supervision over the past four years our active beta unconstrained fixed income and income oriented strategies funds for example offer our clients compelling new opportunities whats more eight acquisitions since the beginningof  have driven more than  billion in inflows these acquisitions have added important new capabilities filled gaps in our asset management offering and added scale to our current business for example in we acquired imprint capital advisors a dedicated environmental social and governance investment advisor strengthening our ability to help our clients address these considerations in their portfolioslooking to build upon these efforts we will continue to evaluate targeted strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise impact investing our firm is committed to fostering meaningful changein the global economy and in the communities in which we live and work both through our core businesses and by engaging in other activities that leverage our expertise to promote economic progress this means among other things helping new enterprises succeed and grow by investing in entrepreneurs and helping to finance different types of projects across the globe such as those that can improve living standards within traditionally underserved communities it also means being mindful of the environments importance not only to society asa whole but also to economic growth and driving that core belief through our work with our clients and within the management of our own operations urban investment group we have a long history of innovative impact investing through our urban investment group uig since  uig has committed more than  billion to underserved us communities facilitating the creation and preservation of over  housing units  the majority of which are affordable for low to middle income families  as well as more than  million square feet of community space and over  million square feet of commercial retail and industrial facilities we work with local stakeholders from the nonprofit forprofit and public sectors focusing on community and economic development we have also been a pioneer in the creation of social impact bonds which are financial instruments that leverage private investments to support highimpact social programs in fact we were involved in four of the eight social impact bond financings that have been launched in the us environmental impact we were among the first global financial institutionsto acknowledge the scale and urgency of the challenges posed by climate change when we established our environmental policy framework in  a decade later we have continued to build on our commitmentto environmental stewardship making it a part of our core mission to deploy financial solutions and drive market opportunities that help to address climate change specifically to facilitate the transition to a lowcarbon economy last year we updated our environmental policy framework to include an increased target of  billion in clean energy financings and investments by  up from an earlier target of  billion finally we continue to be mindful of our own operational impact on the environment pledging to be carbon neutral from onwards and to target  percent renewable power to meet our global electricity needs by   women since its launch this initiative has provided morethan  women from

percent of surveyed graduates have increased their revenue  percent have added new jobs and most have doubled the size of their workforces whats also encouraging is the multiplier effect  percent of our graduates have paid it forward by mentoring and teaching business skills to other women in their communities in  the goldman sachs foundation and international finance corporation a member of the world bank group launched the firstever global finance facility dedicated exclusively to womenowned small and mediumsized enterprises to date the facility has made more than  million in commitments to

graduation rate with more than  percent of surveyed participants increasing their revenues and nearly  percent generating new jobs within  months of graduation focus on technology technology underpins everything we do in fact approximately one quarter of our total staff works in technology which demonstrates just how critical it has become to our strategy in several ways first and foremost technology enhances the overall experience and quality of service we are able toprovide to our clients it allows us to execute transactions more quickly and seamlessly to provide better market analytics data and other information and to communicate faster and more efficiently second technology helps us to operate more efficiently as a firm for example relying more on open source and cloud strategies has helped us reduce vendor expenses for our workplace application infrastructure products and market data sources third technology helps us meet new regulatory requirements such as doddfrank implementation and basel iii provisions we have hired more technology staff to build and adapt software and to automate such processes which would have otherwise been highly manual and substantially more time intensive oncewe have fully embedded technology solutions for our regulatory needs we should be able to reduce or redirect resources to support other areas of our firm finally the technology we create or develop inside of goldman sachs can be a standalone product we havea successful track record in this regard with tradeweb directedge and markit as examples of platforms we developed or participated in creating and then monetized today new platforms such as symphony and marquee are helping our clients communicate manage risk and better analyze their investments symphony is an independent company built around core technology developed and contributed by goldman sachs for marquee we built a common application development platform allowing our businesses to create sophisticated tools that deliver cuttingedge capabilities to our institutional investing clients our people in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry like ours technology is clearly a critical differentiator yet the quality of our talent remains a vital competitive advantage for us  if not the vital competitive advantage we maintain ours is a business of relationships this is the casenot only in our work with clients but also here within the firm to that end goldman sachs goes to great lengths to employ the best people with a wide range of experience and backgrounds in  we extended offers to  percent of applicants for open positions and more than  percent of those offered roles chose to join the firm as we compete for talent not only with other financial firms but also across other industries particularly in technology we strive to remain a place where top talent aspires to work we believe our timetested culture of client service teamwork and excellence sets usapart in this regard and we find that people cometo goldman sachs because the nature of our work is fundamentally consequential to the world around them by helping to allocate capital manage risk and provide products services and advice to a broad array of clients goldman sachs plays a vital role in the economyacross industries and regions something that is inherently appealing to people who want to affect positive outcomes with this in mind we are proud that we were once again recognized as an employer of choice acrossa wide variety of metrics on fortune magazines  best companies to work for and most admired companies we were also pleased to again be named as one of working mother magazines  best companies and best companies for multicultural women attracting and retaining the highestcaliber talent also means that we must invest in our people early on in their careers  the best of whom will become the next generation of leadership at the firm building off the learnings of our biennial people survey last year we unveiled a set of new initiatives designed to support junior employees giving them more flexibility and greater exposure to our client franchise in  we also selected our newest class of managing directors in addition to hailing from more than  countries  percent of the class of  started at the firm as analysts a testament to our emphasis on talent development and retention for the long haul looking ahead as we look ahead the question that is top of mind not only to our clients but also to goldman sachs is how do we think about navigating these uncertain times since the second half of  concerns about global economic growth investor sentiment and regulatory and monetary policy  in tandem with other macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics  havemade for pervasive uncertainty slowing growth in china a presidential election in the us a referendum in the uk about its future in the european union volatilityin the markets and regions consumed by conflict to name a few are examples of issues that are naturally generating unease other fundamental questions being raised  from whether technology is permanently displacing jobs to whether monetary policy has reached its limits in affecting economic outcomes  have gone from esoteric to mainstream at goldman sachs we grapple with these questions day in and day out as managers of risk we do our best to understand them and to prepare our clients and our firm for even lowprobability but highly consequential scenarios this is why we worry about deflationary pressures or liquidity problems in financial markets as a result of new regulations or how china will manage its transition from an infrastructuredriven to a consumerdriven economy its why we keep a close eye on emerging markets particularly those that lack diversification and are heavily exposed to commodity exports where a prolonged supply overhang could negatively affect prices for some time to come when our clients confront these or other challengeswe use our institutional resources to help them navigate the choppy waters and we regularly consider how these scenarios and other tailrisk events could directly affect our firm while we must consistently try to see around corners to anticipate problems we also see plenty of reasonsfor optimism we see the us nearing full employment signs of modest inflation and some stabilization in equity and commodity markets we dont see how a world of zero or negative interest rates could possibly be the new normal moreover we view chinas slower rate of economic growth as still substantial particularly given that it is now the worlds secondlargest economy we see room for continued fiscal policy expansion in some economies and options for monetary policy if meaningful growth proves elusive we cant forecast every outcome and we expect the nearterm environment to prove challenging this is why we focus on issues such as tight cost controls and consistently assess our own strategic areas of focusyet we find ourselves generally optimistic about the longer term by staying true to our strategic focus while adapting quickly to structural and cyclical factors and maintaining our focus on meeting the needs of new and existing clients we strive to continue to deliver on our long history of providing our shareholders with best inclass returns

17,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2016,we started  with concerns about global economic growth leading some to comment that the world was headed into a recession while those concerns moderated in the second quarter and the global economic outlook improvedin the second half other concerns drew to the forefront few predicted with conviction the outcome of the united kingdoms referendum on remaining a part of the european union the results of the presidential election in the united states or the markets reactions to either event in last years letter we characterized  as a tale of two halves that was certainly true again in  but in reverse order as our clients  and by extension the firm  navigated the challenging operating environment in the first half our net revenues declined by  percent year over year for the period with the majority of that decline occurring in the first quarter as conditions improved in the second half so did client sentiment as a result net revenues increased by nearly  percent year over year in the second half including two consecutive quarters of more than  percent annualized return on average common shareholders equity the events of the past year are a stark reminder of how quickly expectations and conditions can change andof the importance for us to be nimble and to concentrate on the things we can control despite the difficult start to the year we remained focused on our clients and operating efficiently without surrendering the ability to pursue potential opportunities for the full year the firm generated net revenues of  billion net earnings of  billion and diluted earnings per common share of  our return on average common shareholders equity was  percent despite our focus on cost discipline we did not stop investing in our franchise  including investmentsin technology attracting and retaining top talent and seeking new business opportunities including our efforts to expand our lending footprint most notably through goldman sachs bank usa we believe that our consistent investment in our franchise positioned us to serve our clients when activity increased in the back half of  managing the firm with discipline while preserving optionality for upside can be a difficult balancing act we do not hold preconceived expectations for certain outcomes but rather approach our own operations with the same mindset we do when helping our clients we spend a great deal of time thinking about and preparing for downside scenarios but we are always cognizant that the economy markets and sentiment could break to the high side and we position ourselves for that possibility we believe our client franchise benefits from our consistent commitment to being a diversified and dependable provider of services in this years letter to our shareholders i will discuss these and other topics including our financial profile and the state of our businesses financial profile given the challenging operating environment in the first half of  we undertook steps and actions consistent with the difficult conditions for the first quarter of  with net revenues down by  percent year over year we accrued compensation and benefits expenses  percent lower year over year we ended the year with net revenues and compensation and benefits expenses nine and eight percent lower than  respectively we also completed an initiative that identified a reduction of approximately  million in annualrun rate compensation during the year in which we realized approximately  million net of severance and other related costs during  including these efforts we have announced and completed  billion in savings initiatives since  this demonstrates how our flexible cost base helps us navigate challenging operating environments the impact of our efforts can be seen by comparing our results in  to   was an instructive year  as it was a tough net revenues year similar to  in  we had net revenues of approximately  billion with operating expenses of approximately  billion our compensation and benefits to net revenues ratio was more than  percent and our pretax margin was over  percent in  despite higher net revenues our operating expenses were down by  percent vs  our compensation and benefits to net revenues ratio was down by  basis points and our pretax margin was more than  percentage points higher this reflects a lot of the firms work in cost discipline and provides significant operating leverage for the future our cost savings efforts in  were part of a broader focus on efficiencies for example over the past five years we have grown our head count in our salt lake city office by nearly  percent making it our fourthlargest location globally in terms of our capital and liquidity our balance sheet has never been more conservatively positioned as a result of adjustments we have made to adapt to new regulations since the financial crisis by almost all measures goldman sachs and the broader financial system is safer for example our global core liquid assets have increased by almost four times our common shareholders equity has nearly doubled and our gross leverage has been cut by more than onehalf since the end of  moreover we have reduced our balance sheet size by seven percent over the past five years while increasing our common shareholders equity by  percent and our book value per common share by  percent over the same period we have returned nearly  billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends reducing our basic share count by more than  million shares or approximately  percent to the lowest ever importantly while these efforts helped us to strengthen our balance sheet they did not detract us from remaining focused on sustaining and improving the quality of our client franchise investment banking our investment banking franchise reflects deep relationships with more than  clients across a variety of industries in approximately  countries we ended the year ranked first in global announced and completed mergers and acquisitions advising on many of the years most significant transactions as has long been the case our advisory franchise creates other opportunities across the firm such as in debt underwriting which is able to serve our clients with bestinclass debt financing capabilities our financial advisory net revenues declined compared to a strong  partially offset by record debt underwriting net revenues of  billion in fact we ended the year ranked in the top five in global debt and in the top three in global highyield  areas where we traditionally have not had the same footprint as some of our larger competitors we also continued to maintain a leading equity underwriting franchise though net revenues declined significantly in  as a result of the operating environment nevertheless we ended the year strong as our investment banking transaction backlog grew in the fourth quarter institutional client services with a leading diversified global platform in institutional client services ics comprising our fixed income currency and commodities client execution ficc and equities franchises we are one of the few firms that have remained committed to serving our clients needs broadly across financial products services and regions we did not extrapolate from the exceptional conditions of the past several years to draw hard and fast conclusions about the ficc franchise these conditions included interest rates near or below zero a flat yield curve and muted economic growth that is why we put a premium on maintaining our commitment to businesses that we knew were important to our clients we have a diverse client franchise and one area of particular strength has long been our standing with the hedge fund community our product diversity global footprint worldclass prime brokerage capabilities and engagement strategy based on content are of particular value to hedge fund clients over the past few years we also have made it a key priority to deepen relationships with more traditional asset managers as an example of our progress we have seen market share improvements in our us cash credit businesses where asset managers have historically been active both hedge funds and active managers could face a much different and more attractive market environment in  to the extent decreasing market correlations translate into a better backdrop for generating outsized performance that should also support increasing levels of client activity despite the headwinds that marked the start of ics net revenues were down modestly compared to  ficc net revenues increased slightly year over year which is notable given market conditions in the first quarter equities client execution net revenues declined significantly year over year driven by lower clientactivity levels investment management our broad portfolio of solutions and consistent performance have enabled us to be one of the fastest growing active investment managers in the world our product offerings range from asset and liability management for our private wealth clients to tailored advisory solutions for our institutional clients to fund products across all asset classes net revenues declined year over year in  due largely to lower incentive fees however even in a more challenging environment we have continued to build our franchise over the past three years we have grown our assets under supervision by  billion to a record of nearly  trillion that growth would be akin to creating a top  us asset manager in just three years and includes  billion of organic active longterm net inflows during this period many active investment managers have seen net client outflows despite such growth we continue to see significant potential as investors consolidate assets with leading providers there are bigger players within each of the product categories in which we compete offering room to garner more market share we will pursue that growth by providing clients with comprehensive advice thought leadership and innovative products that will help them to better meet their investing needs investing  lending investing  lending is a collection of activities thatis synergistic with other elements of our overall franchise helping us to expand our client relationships we continue to provide longterm capital by way of direct lending and equity investments and remain focused on opportunities that provide strong riskadjusted returns on capital over the long term growing our lending footprint in particular we continue to see lending as a growth opportunity for the firm approximately onethirdof our  net revenues in investing  lending was generated by debt securities and loans which included more than  billion in net interest income over the past four years we increased our fundedloans  times to roughly  billion corporate loans diversified across sectors and industries make up percent of the portfolio followed by private wealth management loans at  percent and real estate loans at  percent we continue to see increased demand from our investment banking and private wealth management clients and we are intent on prudently increasing our lending portfolio this past fall we launched marcus by goldmansachs  an online lending platform designed to provide consumer clients with an alternative to higherinterest rate credit card debt the growth in digital finance combined with our historical strength in technology and risk management led us to see an opportunity to add value to this attractive new market for goldman sachs by most measures the opportunity is broad and deep the unsecured consumer loan market in the us is roughly  billion we are focused on creditworthy consumers with  to  of credit card debt the majority of whom are not aware of better debt management options we have received encouraging feedback from our new clients as we have slowly built out the business and continue to see potential for attractive riskadjusted growth opportunities focus on technology technology is central to every part of our business simply put it is a core competitive advantage that drives longterm value in several ways  namely through enhancing our clients experience driving efficiencyand creating new opportunities like marcus our investment in our marquee platform a collection of applications for our institutional clients represents one such cuttingedge opportunity marquee allows clients to access some of the same analysis and risk management tools our market makers use more broadly we are investing in infrastructureto improve our electronic execution capabilities including for systematic investing clients who require speed and differentiated execution and for straight through processing we have also made successful investments in electronic execution platforms our global infrastructure as a result of this and other investments is now capable of executing equity and select ficc transactions in a much more efficient manner importantly all of our clients  not just our clients with quantitative strategies  enjoy the benefits of better execution we have likewise integrated technology into our recruiting processes in particular to facilitate firstround video interviews with the goal of widening and diversifying the pool of talent we evaluate for s intern class so far we have conducted interviews with candidates from more than  schools reaching  more schools than last year our people of course our most important longterm competitive advantage is our people our commitment to attracting and retaining the most talented people in our industry  and beyond  is of vital importance to the firm and the perennial foundation of our success we must be diverse and representative of the countries and cultures in which we operate our people represent more than  different nationalities and speak over  different languages i am pleased to report that goldman sachs

operate our businesses we have increasingly been focused on hiring individuals with backgrounds in science technology engineering and math stemin   percent of new campus analysts who joined the firm came from these stem majors today approximately  people or roughly onequarter of the firm work in various engineeringrelated roles more broadly our people continue to see the value of a longterm career at goldman sachs the median tenure of our partners and managing directors at the firm is  years and nearly  percent of them joined the firm as an analyst or associate our entry level positions to ensure that the talent we hire is the talent we keep over the long term we invest hundreds of thousands of training hours in our new analysts and provide thousands of classroom programs and digital resources for senior professionals executive succession and our deep leadership bench in  and the early part of this year we saw a number of movements in our leadership ranks as well as a key addition to our board of directors as chairman and chief executive officer in consultation with our board of directors one of my most important priorities is smooth and effective leadership transitions this past december thenus presidentelect donald trump appointed gary cohn then our president and chief operating officer director of the national economic council gary was responsible for developing and leading many of the firms most important initiatives and demonstrated a deep commitment to our clients our people and the culture of goldman sachs we thank him for having served as a trusted advisor dedicated colleague and friend to so many at the firm andwish him well david solomon our former cohead of the investment banking division and harvey schwartz our chief financial officer assumed new responsibilities as presidents and cochief operating officers of the firm in addition marty chavez chief information officer was named deputy chief financial officer of goldman sachs and will become chief financial officer this past year was also marked by some senior retirements from the firm michael woody sherwood vice chairman of the firm and cochief executive officer of goldman sachs international and mark schwartz chairman of goldman sachs asia pacific and vice chairman of the firm announced their retirements following decades of service we wish both woody and mark all the best in the years ahead and thank them for their extraordinary contributions to goldman sachs richard gnodde cohead of the investment banking division and chief executive officer of goldman sachs international and pablo salame cohead of the securities division were appointed vice chairmen of the firm david harvey marty richard and pablo have a long track record of distinction in their respective areas of expertise spanning multiple businesses and geographies in december we welcomed a new member to our board of directors ellen kullman is an accomplished business leader who has held a variety of senior roles at e i du pont de nemours and company including as chairman and chief executive officer we are confident that her deep experience in business and as a board member in both the public and nonprofit sectors will add great value to our board of directors our tradition of leadership and public service gary was not the first person from goldman sachs to join the government and we hope and expect that he will not be the last five of my most recent predecessors went into government service and that has not been by happenstance one ethic that has long pervaded goldman sachs is a commitment to public service if one is given the opportunity to serve and that has been true over time and in many of the geographies in which we operate we recruit people who are oriented to the larger world and their jobs require them to be both outwardly and inwardly facing in the process they develop the skills to make a contribution in large complex organizations and the expertise to help drive economic progress and job creation we have been criticized for the fact that some of our colleagues after long careers at the firm have movedto work in the public sector the charge is that goldman sachs is able to extract certain advantages that others cannot in fact the opposite is true those in government bend over backward to avoid any perception of favoritism we are proud of our tradition of leadership and public service and believe it is a core part of our culture that is why we will continue to encourage our people to contribute to government service if they are fortunate enough to be asked we also have contributed our expertise and knowledgeto broader public policy issues such as fiscal policyand when certain issues impact our people we have not hesitated to speak up on their behalf in the past we have commented on marriage equality and more recently immigration policy because they both affect our ability to hire and retain people from the broadest pool of talent we will continue to express our views on policies that affect our people our business and the longterm interests of economic growth our commitment to our communities goldman sachs has long embraced our responsibilityto help address social and economic challenges around the world our approach goes far beyond the significant financial support we provide to a broad array of philanthropic endeavors we also make meaningful contributions that harness our business expertise relationships and knowledge to address critical needsin the communities in which we work and live and sometimes far beyond  women since  the goldman sachs  women initiative has helped foster economic growth by providing women entrepreneurs in  countries with business education and access to capital the initiative is now expanding to reach more than  women through a firstofits kind global finance facility launched in partnership with the international finance corporation to increase access to capital for women entrepreneurs to grow their businesses by the end of  the facility had committed more than  million to banks in  emerging markets which will enable more than  women entrepreneurs to access capital  small businesses  small businesses has served more than  small businesses at  sites across the united states and the united kingdom by the end of  this initiative has worked with more than  local and national lenders and other organizations to provide access to management training capital and business support services independent evaluations of the program have shown that participants consistently increase revenues and create net new jobs at a pace that outperformsthe broader economy goldman sachs gives through this donoradvised fund partners at the firm recommend grants to nonprofit organizations around the world since its launch in  the fund has made more than  grants totaling nearly  billion through the end of  to  organizations that further goldman sachs gives mission of fostering innovative ideas and solving economic and social issues grants from goldman sachs gives have recently supported the middle east refugee crisis stem education for underserved youths globally medical research across a variety of fields and needbased financial aid at colleges and universities globally to name a few key initiatives looking ahead we often say that no one has a crystal ball markets change course at a moments notice and in responseto factors no one can predict with any certainty cycles come and cycles go but if we manage our business with discipline and preserve our flexibility for upside we can put ourselves in the best position to meet the needs of our clients and to grow our franchise we have long maintained that it is important to remain active and invested in our core businesses despite cyclical pressures both as we respond in the short term and orient ourselves for the horizon in the past decade or so some in our industry pulled back from sales and trading businesses that to some seemed to be permanently and negatively affected by market conditions regulatory change and other factors we remained committed to the value we provide clients in those businesses across cycles it is difficult to know how effective we have been at achieving the balance between cutting costs and investing in businesses until the cycle fully turns regardless of which way the future breaks we do however see many reasons for optimism putting aside ones individual politics the outcome of the us election raises the possibility of more stimulative tax and regulatory policies as well as plans for more infrastructure spending this represents a substantial change in direction for the us and offers many investors and companies a reason for optimism economic growth was showing signs of improvement even before the election us interest rates are poised to rise as policymakers digest improving economic indicators while other global markets hold steady or even engage in stimulus creating opportunities for investors in monetary policy divergence more durable market trends may yet emerge and spur healthier levels of client activity looking ahead to  goldman sachs remains committed to working with our clients and leveraging the resources of the firm to help them achieve their objectives while creating longterm value for shareholders i believe that our client franchise is as strong as ithas ever been we have transformed our balance sheet in ways that help us better weather challenging environments while allowing us to pivot in timesof higher client activity we have prudently managed our operating expenses and capital building significant operating leverage by staying true to our strategic focus i am confident we can continue to generate industryleading returns for shareholders and outperform over the long term ,7.398,1.0
18,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2017,throughout most of  the global economy generally expanded reflecting growth in both developed and emerging market economies in the united states the economic recovery continued into its ninth year as the labor market steadily improved euro area economies strengthened even as measures of inflation remained subdued in asia japan experienced solid growth boosted by the strength of its exports while china grew robustly in part due to the global recovery and the success of past policy changes  for goldman sachs generally higher asset prices and tighter credit spreads were supportive of mergers and underwriting as well as investing and lending activities at the same time low levels of volatility served as a headwind for our marketmaking businesses the diversity of our net revenue mix was instrumental in our performance for the year with three of our four segments producing solid revenue growth leading toan overall increase in our net revenues in  we generated net revenues of  billion a five percent increase over  during  the tax cuts and jobs act us tax legislation was enacted resultingin a  billion onetime estimated income tax expense excluding this expense net earnings applicable to common shareholders grew  percent to  billion diluted earnings per common share of  were  percent higher and our return on average common shareholders equity roe was  percent we have delivered doubledigit roe in five out of the last six years and for that sixth year our roe was percent while we may not have a contract to deliver doubledigit returns in every possible circumstanceour focus and intensity including the way we manage expenses demonstrate the importance we attach to shareholder returns inflection points this past year represented several points of inflection for our business and the industry first we appear to be moving from an environment of generally lower economic growth to one with stronger global growth and tighter labor markets second central banks are shifting away from extraordinarily accommodative monetary policies  policies which have dampened market volatility  to generally more normal approaches and third we may be transitioning from an intense period of increasing layers of regulation to a focus on rationalizing redundancies and assessing costs and benefits against this backdrop we are focusing our energy on earnings growth  in particular growth from consistent investments in our franchise growth by broadening our client and product footprint and growth through new initiatives where we have not previously competed through it all we assess opportunities through a framework that responds to a clear client need leverages the firms core competencies including risk management and advice and provides attractive longterm shareholder returns to that end in september  we laid out a  billion net revenue growth plan over the next three years while the plan includes contributions from each ofour businesses this is not the limit of our ambitions importantly these strategic initiatives are not dependent on any improvement in the current operating environment that said broader economic trends market conditions and client conviction appear to be more favorable in this years letter to our shareholders we providean overview of the progress we are making on our strategic growth initiatives across our major businesses underpinning these initiatives are significant investments in engineering which are critical to driving the expansion of our client franchise our history of commitment to investing in technology has created a competitive advantage and is at the center of our efforts to enhance the client experience and improve operating efficiency and scale we conclude the letter with some thoughts on theyear ahead our focus on growth investment banking we continue to have the preeminent global franchise in investment banking in  the business generated its secondhighest net revenues since the firms initial public offering in  driven by the deep relationships that we have built with more than  clients over many decades we ended the year ranked first in worldwide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions ma and also ranked first in worldwide equity and equityrelated offerings and common stock offerings to grow from here we are increasing our coverage universe by approximately  companies focusingon both private and public companies where we have significant room to build relationships of the new target clients we have begun covering over  percent and expect to add the remainder in the next  to  months to put this opportunity into perspective our announced ma volume market share on transaction sizes greater than  billion was approximately  percent in however we had just over  percent share on transaction sizes of less than  billion these transactions tend to have fewer advisors and provide substantial financing opportunities we are also expanding our presence in north america deploying more senior coverage bankers in major cities like atlanta dallas seattle and toronto we see this as an important opportunity to deepen our client coverage in certain cities that are increasingly important hubs of corporate activity as a result of all of our client coverage efforts we have seen more than  new mandates across a variety of industry groups another reason for our confidence in investment bankings growth is the success we have had in debt underwriting we identified debt underwriting as a strategic priority five years ago and in  we produced nearly  billion of net revenues  more than double our average from  to  lastly china continues to represent a larger portionof the global economy today more than  percent of the fortune global  companies are chinese in  we were ranked first in equity and equityrelated offerings among international banks in the regionand we are confident our strong footprint positions us well to continue to capture opportunities created by chinas growth institutional client services institutional client services includes some of ourmost dynamic businesses and we manage the resources in these businesses in the context of the operating environment this has been particularly true in fixed income currency and commodities client execution ficc ficc in the midst of industrywide revenues falling by roughly  percent from their peak in  we managed ficc resources down significantly we took these actions because the opportunities in ficc had declined this was certainly due to secular changes but it also reflected cyclical dynamics as well today the trajectory of the global economy appears to be moving towards a firmer footing in this context we dont believe it is wise strategically to forgo the potential upside in this business moving forward in fact we have recently deployed more resources given the increasingly attractive opportunity set with respect to our execution and performance in  our performance in ficc was weak in the context of our commitment to the business in response we undertook a comprehensive and detailed review to identify how we could improve our franchise has historically been very focused on active investor clients structured trades and derivatives as a consequence we underinvested in cash products which led to lower penetration with certain large asset managers and banks to address these issues we are broadening our bankand asset manager client coverage and are focused on growing our corporate coverage we have also diversified our product footprint by enhancing our cash and flow trading capabilities and we are holding our people accountable for delivering top three client rankings our efforts are showing early signs of success as we drive market share increases across our businesses we are confident that these efforts will manifest themselves to all of our ficc clients over time a key differentiator supporting our overall growthwill be employing our engineering capabilities to provide clients with best execution content and analytics for example we have consolidated our automated pricing and risk management of electronic trading across equities rates currencies and commodities into a cohesive unit to drive efficiencies for our clients andthe firm in summary we are executing on our strategy in ficc to invest in areas where we see the greatest opportunity to meet client needs grow market share and if need be reduce capital and expenses to size the business commensurate with client activity equities in equities we are making a multiyear investment in people platforms and products to grow our leading franchise in both execution and financing in the last few years we have made several strategic hires to enhance our electronic execution offering includinga new chief data officer for the firm a global head of electronic execution services and a chief technology officer of electronic trading in  we added about  people focused on electronic execution including more than  engineers in terms of platforms two years ago we acquired a highperformance trading platform from pantor engineering ab which we have now rolled out to our european clients today our smart router capabilities put us among the top three providers of the fastest most comprehensive access to developed european markets at the end of  we had an important validation of our electronic capabilities announcing that we would become the exclusive execution provider for bloombergs tradebook as a result we are bringing on more than  new clients from which we expect a revenue run rate of over  million these and other investments support our initiative to serve quantitativefocused investors this is an important and growing segment of the market where we provide both execution and financing services from these and other investments we expect to increase our market share in electronic execution which will benefit allof our equities clients investment management our investment management business remains well positioned because of our breadth of asset classes products and distribution in  we had  billion in longterm feebased ltfb net inflows across the platform we have had consistent growth with about  billion of ltfb net inflows over the last five years including  billion from acquisitions in goldman sachs asset management we continue tobe a top provider to companies as they increasingly outsource the management of their pension plans and other assets currently we have over  billion in

outsourcing trend is happening withinmany insurance companies we manage or advise on another  billion from insurance clients who leverage our enhanced analytics custom asset allocation and risk management capabilities in private wealth management we saw strong longterm net inflows of  billion in  up from  billion in  wealth creation is expanding at a rapid clip and given the strength of our offering and brand we have not seen the limit to the growth of this segment of the market we currently have over  private wealth advisors and expect to grow our advisor population by approximately  percent through  in ayco we provide financial planning services to  corporate clients and  executives across corporate america however we currently cover only  percent of the fortune  at the end of we launched our digital advisory service designed for ayco corporate client employees this platform is liveat more than  companies and we expect to roll this out to an additional  companies by the end of  investing  lending our investing  lending businesses provide promising companies and other clients with the capital they needto grow  either in the form of a loan or an equity investment our funded loan portfolio was  billion at the end of   times higher since the end of  in private wealth management we have increased our lending to our existing private wealth management clients growing our funded loans balance to about  billion in  or a  percent increase yearover year lending net revenues from private wealth management clients increased about  percent compared to  through gs select we are working with thirdparty registered investment advisors to offer securitiesbased loans from goldman sachs bank usa to their private wealth management clients this digital platform is just getting started but we have already signed up some of the largest independent registered investment advisors in the us who serve clients with nearly  trillion in assets institutional lending and financing is also animportant part of our growth strategy an opportunityset driven by our special situations group a differentiated financing and investing business here dedicated teams of experienced underwriters partner primarily with middlemarket companies to finance assets improvetheir capital structure or deploy capital this business is one of the highest margin and highest return businesses in the firm by growing our loan portfolio we have increased our net revenue contribution from net interest income which makes investing  lending net revenues more stable and recurring we entered  with a  billion net interest income run rate before considering further loan growth and net interest income in the fourth quarter was up roughly  percent yearoveryear another important investing business is our merchant banking business which helps to start and grow companies merchant banking has been a source of strong riskadjusted return opportunities and a core part of the firms dna and mission weve been in this business for over  years and it constitutes as powerful a franchise as any other in our firm since the beginning of  we generated nearly billion of net revenues from our diversified portfolio of equity investments with the largest contribution from merchant banking we continue to see attractive opportunities as an active investor on behalf of both our clients and the firm where our unique global franchise is an excellent sourcing mechanism for example in the past two years we sourced over  billion in commitments to invest across our equity and credit merchant banking activities in november  we announced the cooperation fund partnering with the china investment corporation we intend to raise  billion to invest mainly in american manufacturing industrial consumer and healthcare companies among others that are developing businessin china or anticipate doing so in the future marcus marcus by goldman sachs marcus is our digital consumer financial services platform the foundation of this new business is rooted in addressing real consumer pain points by delivering value through products that are simple transparent and flexible marcus launched with single nofee

goal is to conduct philanthropy with a purpose  making meaningful contributions where our skills and leadership can make a clear difference  small businesses summit as a natural next step in our focus on small businesses we hosted in february  the  small businesses summit the big power of small business which was the largestever gathering of small business owners in the us taking place in washington dc the summit convened more than  small business owners from a diverse range of industries and geographies with a select group of business leaders industry experts and policymakers to discuss the vital role that small businesses play in the us economy from sharing strategies and tactics for hiring obtaining capital and optimizing growth to discussing policy related topics such as regulation and global competition this unique event provided an opportunity for the alumni of  small businesses to come together and share ideas discuss common challenges and elevate their collective

investments in underserved urban areas we work with local leaders and nonprofits focusing on community development and financing for socially motivated enterprises and small businesses while the investment strategy has evolved over the years the mission remains the same to make an impact in underserved areas while making a good return since its inception in  through the end of uig has committed more than  billion to underserved us communities facilitating the creation and preservation of more than  housing units  the majority of which are affordable for low to middleincome families  as well as more than  million square feet of community space and over  million square feet of commercial retail and industrial facilities as an example goldman sachs committed nearly million to the essex crossing development onthe lower east side of manhattan the project at million square feet is one of the largest developments in new york city and is reactivating a site that had sat vacant for almost  years essex crossing which was designed with the local community will include just over  apartments more than half of which are reserved for low and middleincome tenants and  square feet of commercial and community space such projects have the potential to usher in a new model for urban investment focusing on infrastructure jobs and resources that benefit the public at large looking ahead today conditions are highly supportive of a growing economy and interest rates are relatively low for where we are in the growth cycle but as managers of riskwe do our best to prepare our clients and the firm for lowprobability yet highly consequential events with the us near full employment inflation still relatively low and the end of quantitative easing there is a greater chance that excesses can build up in this vein we continue to be mindful of what can go wrong keeping a close eye on risk particularly in the context of the credit cycle cycles come and go and as we have seen in recent months markets can change course at a moments notice and often in response to factors no one can predict with any certainty still we remain optimistic and confident in our ability to grow our client franchise is strong and we are executing on our growth initiatives including making investments across our businesses to expand our franchise and to grow earnings across the firm the hard work commitment and collaboration of our people will remain cornerstones of our longterm success in the process we are confident that we can continue to generate strong relative returns and value

19,Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2018,the opportunity to lead goldman sachs is extraordinarily humbling and exciting made even more so as this year is the firms th anniversary like each of my predecessors my responsibility is to preserve the legacy of goldman sachs while remaining open to the change and innovation that best meets the needs of our clients i am privileged to be surrounded by exceptionally talented people at all levels of our firm including john waldron our president and chief operating officer and stephen scherr our chief financial officer who are also intensely focused on ensuring that clients are at the center of everything we do  and in doing so creating longterm value for our shareholders while much has changed over the course of our year history teamwork integrity adaptability and client service remain at the core of our culture the strength of our culture and client franchise was at the heart of our financial performance in  we achieved record diluted earnings per common share and attained our highest annual return on average common shareholders equity and return on average tangible common shareholders equity since  net revenues of  billion and pretax earnings of  billion were both  percent higher compared with  and the highest since  book value per common share and tangible book value per common share increased by  percent during the year to  and  respectively our strategy this performance alongside our strong levels of capital and liquidity put goldman sachs on a solid foundation as we look ahead our focus is on delivering sustainable longterm returns for our shareholders through a strategy that revolves around our clients our strategy comprises three core priorities  growing and strengthening our existing businesses by deepening our relationships with existing clients and expanding our capabilities to serve new clients  diversifying our business mix by increasing our feebased or more recurring revenues including by launching new products and services and  achieving greater operating efficiency across all areas of the firm including expenses funding costs and capital without compromising the longstanding strength of our control and risk management functions our strategy reflects the need to anticipate and adapt to the structural forces that shape economies and industries and how our clients operate within them markets financial instruments and products and different client segments are converging and competing with one another at an unprecedented pace this requires us to simultaneously invest for growth and to create better efficiencies in the way we run certain businesses i have advised companies for over three decades and the ones i have admired most are those that have managed their resources to allow for both investment and shareholder return this is particularly critical when you consider how technology is influencing the way institutions and consumers alike are transacting in various markets and products including in our industry in that context across a number of our businesses particularly our marketmaking businesses we have to achieve the scale necessary to execute transactions in the most effective way for our clients that means investing in platforms and empowering those who build them it means encouraging the innovative ideas of our people that take good products and make them great and it means looking at the revenues and expenses of businesses fronttoback so that we have a cleareyed view of where technology investments the allocation of capital and other resources will be most critical to best delivering our advice execution and risk management to our clients since last fall we have undertaken a review of eachof our major businesses and the core activities within them each review has reinforced the fact that we benefit enormously from a strong client franchise around the world at the same time we see tremendous opportunities to expand our addressable market and grow new businesses as we pursue these opportunities our focus on strong risk management and controls will be central to our ability to meet the expectations ofour clients and our shareholders over the course of the year i look forward to communicating more details on our strategic direction and priorities which will include sharing certain financial metrics and targets to which my colleagues and i will be held accountable i feel a sense of urgency and excitement about the opportunities we have identified but it isalso important to be diligent and deliberate and notrush into longterm decision making while not exhaustive i want to spend the bulk of this letter providing you with a sense of the opportunities and priorities we will be focused on in the months and years ahead  wallet share through first nine months of as fullyear data not yet available source coalition grow and strengthen our existing businesses our first strategic priority is to expand our existing businesses and we are executing on a variety of growth initiatives to that end in investment banking for example we have embarked on a broad footprint expansion strategy that includes hiring new senior bankers adding coverage for more than  new companies and creating opportunities to help more clients access equity capital and debt financing as of year end we have made significant progress having assigned coverage on approximately  percent of our targeted universe of new clients across the americas and emea across ficc and equities we have strong institutional wallet share which has improved by  and  basis points respectively since  when i talk with many of our clients it is clear that they value ficcs deep risk intermediation capabilities and expertise in addition to that focus we continue to leverage platforms that integrate execution analytics and content for our clients in equities we are growing our electronic execution business through the development of lowtouch platforms and we are working with more corporate clients in emea and asia particularly as it relates to our ability to deliver risk management solutions to them over the past five years investment management has generated organic longterm feebased net inflows of approximately  billion we see further potential in this business by growing our advisory and outsourced cio services as well as by expanding our product offering  notably our alternatives platform and etfs we are also expanding our worldclass private wealth management business by adding new private wealth advisors and increasing our collateralized lending to clients within investing  lending our merchant banking business comprises a diversified portfolio across corporate private equity and global real estate thatis managed by hundreds of investment professionalsand led by tenured senior leadership our strong track record built over the course of several decades positions us well to provide clients with additional attractive investing opportunities these various initiatives to strengthen and grow our existing businesses will be underscored by an emphasis on delivering the full value of one goldman sachs to our clients an increasing number of institutions and companies interact with different parts of our firm they dont view their relationship with goldman sachs through the prism of a product or division historically we have tended to manage our client relationships through more of a divisional lens which can sometimes limit a more holistic view of how best to identify and meet the needs of these clients who are global complex and multifaceted one of my first priorities as ceo has been to ensure that the full range of our services and skill set is more accessible comprehensive and efficiently deliveredin that vein we have formed a crossdivisional client initiative led by senior leaders in our institutional client services investment management and investment banking businesses to work with a pilot group of clients with multidimensional business needs even at this early stage i am encouraged by the feedback from our clients and what we have learned from them over time we plan to expand this initiative to a broader group of clients with the simple goal of ensuring that we are orienting our client coverage around what is most important to our clients regardless of division or product area focus diversify our business mixwith new products and servicesa second element of our strategy is a focus on more durable revenues through lending and deposit activities cash management and wealth management we have made considerable progress over the past five yearsbut there is more we can do in the years ahead in  we established marcus by goldman sachs our digital consumer financial services business we are working to connect our growing customer base  and their growing wealth  to our broader suite of services as we develop a multitiered digital wealth management offering over time we expect this will grow to be another core capability of our clientcentric multiproduct marcus platform we are pleased with our early progress we havemore than  million total customers  billion in consumer deposits in the us and the uk and nearly  billion of consumer loans we are cognizant of the risk profile of our nascent consumer lending business and will remain attentive to where we are in the cycle as we grow our business for the long term we are also developing a dynamic digital cash management and payments platform for corporate clients and the potential for goldman sachs in this space is significant the industry cash management wallet is larger than the global investment banking wallet we competefor today as the leading ma advisor globally companies already trust us to provide advice on their most significant transactions we will build on these strong relationships and forge new ones by delivering new solutions that solve customer frustrations around outdated technology and limited customization and analytics we see a real opportunity to provide clients with a modern global cash management platform that is both secure and flexible we expect this business to be accretive to our return profile and to provide a number of benefits to adjacent businesses including growing deposits and generating more client flows for our currencies franchise we are making tangible progress in building this platform and i expect that we will launch a cash management offering to clients next year achieve greater operating efficiency our third strategic priority is to ensure we are maximizing operating efficiency by investing in automation and technology that will improve the client experience and drive expense savings across our businesses for instance in ficc we are a top institutional provider and gained share in six of eight asset classes in  but the opportunity set and the global ficc wallet has declined significantly over the past decade to adapt we have made important improvements in ficcs efficiency reducing standardized riskweighted assets by  percent and expenses by more than  percent each compared to  ficc will continue to be a valuable offering for our clients and we see attractive opportunities to build scale within ficc as the market structure continues to evolve part of building scale is through improving the client experience and that means operating more efficiently positioning ourselves for growth across our businesses partially entails funding investments from realized operating leverage in our core businesses to help enforce this we are looking at our costs holistically and have improved our firmwide efficiency ratio to  percent in  down nearly  percentage points over the past two years we also are identifying ways to manage our balance sheet more efficiently we have identified deposits as a strategic focus to diversify our funding mix and lower our funding costs and have grown our deposit base by  billion over the past two years to  billion at the end of  a culture of risk management as we grow and expand our business reach bringing goldman sachs to more clients and customers weare dedicated to maintaining the primacy of the control function at the firm and upholding the highest standards in risk and operational management there are always important lessons to be learned from difficult situations and as it relates to mdb we have looked back and will continue to reflect on anythingelse the firm could have done better it remains a priority for me that our culture of integrity compliance and escalation only improves from this experience effective risk management is demanding and difficult it requires constant vigilance and we wont always get  goldman sachs  annual report it right but an unwavering cultural commitment to it lies at the heart of an effective financial institution and we believe it is a core competence that helps define goldman sachs our people i have been fortunate to have worked closely withlloyd blankfein over the years who stepped down as chairman and ceo last year throughout his  yearsof dedicated service to the firm his keen understanding of markets and risk have been invaluable to keeping the firm both nimble and resolute in the face of constant change and amidst the most turbulent days of the global financial crisis it was lloyds fortitude and leadership that steadily navigated goldman sachs and its people through one of the most difficult episodes in our history he has been a valued partner and colleague and i am grateful for his mentorship judgment and counsel in my travels and time with clients one refrain i hear time and again is that goldman sachs is different because of the quality of our people our success in delivering for our clients and on our strategic priorities depends on attracting retaining and developing talented people professionals want to be constantly learning working on important problems that have broad significance to industries economies and society and to be surrounded by diverse colleagues in my short time as ceo ive been vocal about the importance of advancing our firms diversity including with respect to gender race sexual orientation disability or whatever contributes to who we are effectively serving a broad and diverse set of clients means having an appreciation and understanding of their different experiences interests and values and we are committed to building a team capable of that critical work over the years the firms diversity and inclusion efforts have evolved from raising broader awareness and delivering an array of programs to a more deliberate datadriven and targeted strategy we have made progress in recent years and have more diverse representation on our board of directors in addition our most recent partner class had the highest percentage of women and black partners in our history and we are nearly there on the campus analyst hiring goals we established last year but we have a longer path ahead of us as it relates to our broader diversity ambitions we are working with our global diversity committee to advance specific goals and objectives we are undertaking new initiatives aimed at increasing the representation of diverse communities at all levels across the firm this includes increasing the representation of our analyst and entrylevel associate new joiners  which represents more than  percent of our annual hiring  to  percent women  percent black professionals and  percent hispaniclatino professionals in the americas and  percent black professionals in the uk fundamental change takes time but if were rigorous in our execution of incremental change we will make it happen we simply do not have a choice but to strive to be one of the most diverse and inclusive institutions in the world if we are not creative and do not take the right measures to embed a more diverse workforce across every facet of diversity we put in jeopardy our relevance to our clients and the markets we serve sustainability managing the firm responsibly is core to our goalof driving superior longterm shareholder returnswe cannot be successful over the long term for our investors unless we think broadly about the impact we have on society and our communities  and then orient ourselves toward ways we can allocate capital purposefully a dedication to service and a commitment to using our expertise and convening power to help address broader issues has long been a core element of our culture over the course of many years we have developed innovative and meaningful philanthropic programs that have improved business education and provided access to capital for thousands of women entrepreneurs and small businesses since the launch of our  women initiative in  we have invested over  million to help women entrepreneurs across  countries providing practical business education mentoring networkingand access to capital most recently we have democratized access to business education on a global scale through the introduction of online business education courses in addition this past year the women entrepreneurs opportunity facility  developed in partnership with the ifc as the first of its kind gender facility  surpassed  billion in investments to financial institutions in  countries and is well on its way to providing capital to  women through our  small businesses program launched in  we have committed  million to provide training and access to capital to small business owners looking to grow and create new jobs in their communities with compelling results to datewe have graduated  small business owners with  percent of graduates reporting revenue increases and  percent adding jobs within  months of graduation we will continue our commitment to these extraordinary programs but we see an increasing opportunity to focus on some of the other important issues that are facing society today  from the environment to health care to urban development for example our urban investment group uighas been a major investor in community development projects committing more than  billion in underserved american markets since  in  uig continued its longterm support of the brooklyn navy yardby committing  million to renovate building a squarefoot manufacturing center that will drive the creation of approximately  quality urban manufacturing jobs last year we announced launch with gs a million initiative to invest in womenled companies and investment managers through this effort we are harnessing our deep investment expertise to narrowthe gender investing gap in three ways committing firm capital in womenfounded owned or led businesses directing client capital to invest in womencentered investing firms and creating an ecosystem to help build future investment opportunities more broadly we have seen fastpaced growth in our environmental social and governance esg and impact investing platform which reached  billion in assets under supervision at the end of  this includes the launch of an esgfocused etf that provides our clients with broad exposure to us large cap companies that rank favorably based on values identified by the american public and as another example at the end of  we reached  billion in our goal to finance or invest  billion in clean energy by  we are a financial institution operating in global markets with a global client base  and we have a real opportunity through that work not only to lead by example in how we run our organization but to drive sustainable outcomes for our clients and for our communities looking ahead goldman sachs of  looks very different from the firm marcus goldman started a century and a half ago frankly it looks different from when i started here nearly  years ago one of the reasons that goldman sachs has succeeded for so long is that it reflects individuals who have been able to adapt with the changing times  from market professionals who see how the emergence of new technologies will create new price setting mechanisms to controlside professionals who react quickly to financial and regulatory changes in an effort to always maintain the firms risk profile and operational integrity what initially attracted me to goldman sachs andwhat has kept me here over the years is our timehonored culture that values teamwork excellence and problem solving it has allowed us not only to survive but thrive in an industry that is cyclical by nature as we look to the future we are building new businesses and reorienting the firm for a broader setof opportunities we have a robust approach to risk management and a strong balance sheet with the talent to deploy and protect it we are investing across our businesses to serve new and existing clients and build upon an extraordinary client franchise thats why i am very confident of goldman sachs ability to generate strong industryleading returns through the cycle

20,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2001,in  your company achieved solid financial results despite a weak economic environment and took major steps to accelerate internal growth improve business execution and focus activities ever more tightly on the needs of our customers associates accelerated work to attract retain and deepen customer relationships and to improve customer and client service throughout the companywe launched a companywide six sigmaquality and productivity program and continuedto reinvest savings in highgrowth opportunitieswe installed a new business planningprocess and a new approach to risk managementthat we believe will bring consistency and predictability to our earningswe hired teammates from different industries who brought new skills to our companywe adopted shareholder value added svaas a measurement tool to bring more financialdiscipline to our business decisions  we continued to invest aggressively inefforts to build the bank of america brand in short we are combining our heritage of ingenuity with an emerging culture based onfocus and discipline consistent execution andsustained intensity to serve customers betterwhile at the same time producing strong growth in total shareholder returns building momentum our associates hard work in  paid off as revenue increased  to  billion leading to an operating earnings increase of  to  billion both impressive figures taking into account rising credit costs and the faltering economy the lions share of earnings growth came from consumer and commercial banking which posted earnings of  billion up  from  driven mostly by gains in net interest income service charges card services and mortgage banking global corporate and investment banking earnings rose  to  billion reflecting an increase in fixedincome originations and increased market share in every major category of capitalraising transactions turmoil in the markets dampened results in the asset management group which held revenues steady but saw earnings fall  to  million due to increased investments in the busi ness equity investments recorded a loss of  million while our core businesses performed well we made a strategic decision in the third quarter to exit the subprime real estate and auto leasing busi nesses both of which tended to produce volatile earnings and did not fit our objectives for prof itability we took a  billion aftertax charge to cover the costs of exiting these businesses credit costs continued to be our greatest drag on earnings net chargeoffs excluding chargeoffs related to the exit of the subprime lending business totaled  billion or  of loans and leases compared to  billion or  the year before deteriorating credit quality was largely limited to the corporate sector in the first half of  but spread to the consumer sector as the recession deepened we expect credit costs to remain high in  the bottom line for shareholders of course is our stock price and in  we stood head and shoulders above the rest of the class in a year in which the average stock price in our peer group declined  your companys stock increased in value  two reasons for heightened investor confidence have been our disciplined approach to balance sheet management and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders throughout the company we used relationshipbanking and pricing incentives to boost deposits at the same time we reduced lowreturning corporate loans on our balance sheet the result is a loantodeposit ratio that today is lower than  which reduces inherent interest rate risk and enhances our ability to control funding costs in the future we also continued to return capital to shareholders in  nearly exhausting the stock repurchase program of  million shares that was approved by the board in  at its december   meeting the board approved further repurchases of up to  million shares over the next  months the board in october also approved a  increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to  or  annually representing a  dividend yield based on our stock price at the end of the year as we look forward to building on ourmomentum in  we are aware of the great uncertainty in our economy no one knowswhen the economy will bounce back from thecurrent recession but we believe we have positioned your company well for the future ourcapital strength and business diversity give us great confidence and were gaining strength and speed even as we fight the current economic headwinds as an expression of this confidence werecently committed to longterm financial goals operating net income of more than  annual earningspershare eps growth  return on equity roe anddoubledigit increases in sva every year the right moves in last years report iwrote that we were investing in our companysgrowth engines and reengineering business processes to improve our service to customers  in  we undertook additional initiatives todrive the organization forward one of the most dramatic changes were making is in the way we are organized in the past we organized our activities largely by geography and by line of business meaning by product or service today taking a cue from our success with corporate clients were changing reporting structures compensation and incentive plans and business processes throughout the company to reflect the customers view for example associate teams are not focused simply on products like mortgages or cards  or on a specific region or city  but on expanding relationships in a customer group such as consumer small business or premier and on providing customers in these groups consistent highquality service regardless of where they live where they happen to be when they contact us or what product or service they are inquiring about this new way of looking at our business is changing the way associates interact with customers design business processes and think of their roles in the organization instead of finding a product or a geographic label at the center of our operations we are more often finding the customer at the center and our customers are beginning to feel the difference were making two other important changes in the way we run the company to accelerate our process improvements we are implementing the six sigma quality and productivity techniques that have proven effective in manufacturing and other industries but have not been widely adopted in financial services six sigma provides our associates powerful tools to analyze business processes identify problems increase efficiency and reduce error rates a signif icant additional benef it is our ability to constantly reinvest cost savings in new revenue growth opportunities we also have implemented an integrated business planning process that brings together four key elements of corporate planning strate gic planning financial planning risk planning and associate planning each of these processes is now designed to take into account the outcomes of the others by integrating our planning we believe the work we do across the company will contribute more effectively to the bottom line we believe our new risk planning process in particular will dramatically improve the consistency of our earnings in short our goal is to make risk management a core strength of this company we are now taking a more holistic view of risk than ever before by incorporating analyses of credit market and operational risk into all strategic financial and associate plans instead of finding a product or a geographic label at the center of our operations we are more often finding the customer at the center and our customers are beginning to feel the difference executive recruiting has been another priority resultingin a number of key hires in businesscritical positionswhile some of these new teammates came from financialservices firms many came from companies in other industries such as manufacturing shipping and consumer productsthese executives joined our already strong managementteam making us even stronger they have brought skillsand knowledge to our organization that arehelping us improve revenue growth businessprocesses customer satisfaction and associate retention we will continue to recruit top talent  aggressively from all industries where execu  tives have the skills knowledge and experienceto take our performance to a higher level if fielding the right team gets us in thegame motivating our players is the way to win we are taking several steps to more closely align associate and shareholder intereststhese steps include shifting the emphasis forbonus awards toward relationshipbuilding andaway from pure sales goals shifting stock option awards from an emphasis on timebased vesting to vesting based on stock price  appreciation and giving senior executives a progressively increasing percentage of their annualincentive payment in restricted stock like measurement tools for associates theways we measure corporate performance also impact our priorities and our decisions for many years like many companies we have looked to the typical financial measure ments to gauge our progress and our success  measures like revenue and earnings growth earnings per share and return on equity these measures are widely used for good reason and we will continue to use them just as we always have that said we also are incorporating shareholder value added or sva into our decision making both at the corpo rate level and throughout the business lines sva measures returns over and above our cost of capital simply put we believe that sva as a performance measure and a decision making tool has an extremely high direct correlation to stock price performance and will help us do a better job of managing the company for the benefit of our owners finally a word about the bank of america brand we believe strongly that a worldclass company must have a worldclass brand and we have continued to invest in the advertising programs and sponsorships that build awareness of our brand across the nation perhaps more important we understand that the real strength of our brand will be determined over time by the consistency and quality of the experiences our customers have when they do business with us it is excellence in this regard to which we have all committed and through which we all will help build a strong bank of america brand for the future our opportunity and responsibility throughout this report you will read about how we are working hard to grow customer relationships as a key strategy in our efforts to grow our company of course we know that we are not the only large banking company pursuing a growth strategy based on expanding relationships the strategy alone is no great secret and by itself will not differentiate us what were focused on is execution and the impact our work is having on our progress toward becoming one of the worlds most admired companies this is the goal i set for our associates last year when i became chair man and it is a goal that all of us are pursuing with vigor and intensity i have said many times this year that the opportunity we have before us is the business opportunity of a lifetime  to take an organization that possesses the right businesses the right strategy and the right people and turn it into one of the greatest companies in the world in fact achieving this goal is more than an opportunity given who we are the position we occupy in the market and the name we do business under  bank of america  i believe that achieving our goal is a responsibility it is a responsibility not only to our shareholders but also to our customers who look to us to help them manage their financial lives

21,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2002,the theme of this report  higher standards  reflects your companys commitment to the idea that in every endeavor there is always an opportunity to raise the bar to do something better than anyone has done it before our commitment to this idea is evident in the years achievements in  your company posted strong financial results in a challenging business environment launched exciting new products and significantly improved customer satisfaction outperformed its peers and gained market share in most of its major businesses and won recognition from two major financial publications us banker and american banker as the best american banking story of the year we are fulfilling our vision for a fully integrated multiproduct financial services company and that vision has not changed we are more convinced than ever that clients of all our businesses want a financial services partner that offers unmatched convenience and expertise high service quality innovation and a variety of products and services delivered as a single relationship we also remain convinced that such a company when managed with focus discipline and intensity will produce strong growth and consistent quality returns for its owners building and preserving trust producing quality returns was as always our top priority in  but there was no denying the top story of the year in corporate america a crisis of public confidence in the ability of american corporations to govern themselves effectively and ethically when your board of directors launched an initiativetwo years ago to review redesign and formally adopt new governing principles we thought we were simply setting new standards required to become a worldclass company we had no idea how rapidly these initiatives would becomea competitive advantage two years later we have confidence in our governance systems and continue to refine our policies to ensure adequate independence control and oversight of our companys activities our governance structure enables us to manage all the major aspects of the companys business effectively through an integrated process that includes financial strategic risk and associate planning in particular we made important changes in our processes for managing risk as a financial services company we are in the business of taking risk  whether we succeed depends largely on whether we take the right risks and whether we get paid appropriately for the risks we take we define risk broadly including not only credit market and liquidity risk  the traditional concerns for banks  but also operational risk including risks related to systems processes or external events as well as legal regulatory and reputation risks in evaluating and responding to risk we employ three lines of accountability to protect shareholder value first the line of business second risk management joined by other units such as finance and legal and third our corporate audit function our management processes structures and policies help us ensure compliance with laws and regulations and provide clear lines of sight for decisionmaking and accountability but these disciplines represent only one side of governance the other side corporate culture is even more importantit is corporate culture  championed by leadership and sustained by every associate within the organization  that determines corporate ethics one way we build and protect our culture is by aggres sively promoting our companys core values to associates at all times as well as our code of ethics which we updated last fall but we also know that actions speak louder than words and so we foster a culture of openness in which healthy debate is encouraged and associates are expected to blow the whistle on improper activity we also do not hesitate to separate ourselves from individuals who violate our cultural standards and expectations regardless of performance or potential we believe results are important  but we believe how we achieve results is equally important our commitment to this principle is the key to sustaining the public trust and confidence in our company strong consistent financial results in  your companys associates produced net income of  billion on revenue of  billion compared to  billion and  billion in  while these are solid results taking into account continuing economic headwinds we are highly focused on increasing revenue in  as we pursue our longterm goal of  to  annual revenue growth earnings per share eps were  shareholder value added sva was  billion and return on equity roe was  these results compared respectively to   billion and  in the result is a stock price for your company that continues to climb in  it increased  to  at yearend a strong gain on top of a  increase of  over a threeyear period bank of america ranks number one in its peer group with a  average total shareholder return including both stock price gains and dividends returning capital to shareholders continues to be a priority in october the board approved a  increase in the quarterly dividend to  or  annually repre senting a  dividend yield based on our stock price at the end of the year in addition we repurchased  million shares of stock in  and the board authorized further repurchases of up to  million shares within  months at its january   meeting as in  our consumer and commercial banking business ccb led the way for our company with par ticularly strong growth in card income mortgage banking income and deposits our results in these businesses demonstrate the tremendous strength of ccb as a growth engine for our company ccb posted earnings of  billion up from  billion a year earlier revenue growth in ccb was  including growth of  in card income and  in mortgage banking income average deposits grew  and consumer loans increased  we also achieved significant growth in our customer base as net new checking accounts increased by more than half a million and active users of online banking surged to more than  million commercial loan levels declined  as companies paid down loan balances we also took steps this year to open new markets and to expand our customer base in the consumer and small business segments last fall we announced plans to open up to  new banking centers over the next three years including  new banking centers in chicago in the coming year banking centers continue to be the dominant channel for the creation of new banking relationships and we are opening these centers in markets that offer the best potential for new growth in december we agreed to purchase a  stake in grupo financiero santander serfin gfss the subsidiary of santander central hispano in mexico for  billion gfss is the thirdlargest and most profitable banking organization in mexico the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of  this investment was driven by our desire to better serve hispanic customers within our us franchise and to increase our presence in all our hispanic communities our relationship with gfss will enable us to better understand our hispanic customers enhance our products and services and position bank of america as the bank of choice for the mexicanamerican population in our key markets finally the investment met our stated financial hurdles and will be accretive to earnings in  our global corporate and investment banking business gcib by focusing on clients in industry sectors with high growth potential and where we have specific expertise gained market share in almost all of its major product and service categories in particular we gained ground in advisory services equity offerings convertibles highgrade debt and assetbacked securities global treasury services continued to provide a strong steady income stream for gcib with a  increase in net income investment banking fees of  billion fell only  from last year even as fees across the industry fell by double digits despite strong performance in gcib relative to our competitors lower demand in marketsensitive businesses including a significant decline in trading profits coupled with continued high credit losses resulted in net income of  billion a  decline from last year results in the asset management group amg also were deeply affected by the challenging economy generally and the doubledigit decline in the stock market specifically net income from amg fell  from a year ago to  million primarily due to weak market activity and one large credit chargeoff these results masked important accomplishments for the business our mutual funds investment results put us among the leading performers in  and assets under management remained stable at  billion while again major market indices fell sharply amg also made strong gains on its great est priority expanding distribution by increasing the number of advisors serving clients our goal was to increase our force of financial advisors by   a goal we surpassed in  our ability to add resources and capabilities in businesses like gcib and amg demonstrates a great advantage ofour diverse revenue streams during a year in which most marketsensitive businesses struggled greatly our corporate earning power enabled us to continue to invest in our investment banking and asset management businesses by adding program trading capabilities for our institutional clients and advisors in asset management we continued to position these businesses well to lead their industries when markets recover your companys financial results clearly illustrate the strength of our business mix steady earnings growth from our retail business combined with volatile but higher potential growth from our marketsensitive businesses enables usto produce consistent results through strong and weak economic cycles in fact we now have posted stable or increased earnings per share in eight consecutive quarters this is the kind of consistent predictable financial performance that makes our company increasingly attractive to investors and also enhances our ability to plan and invest strategically for the future more satisfied customers and clients as pleased as i am about our financial results i am even more encour aged by the progress in our customer and client satisfaction measures which provide the foundation for future growth last year in these pages i wrote about our organic growth strategy our intense focus on customer satisfaction and our six sigma initiatives for enterprisewide process improve ment this year i am pleased to report that our focus on quality and productivity is changing not only our culture inside the company but also the way our customers view us from outside the company for the year the number of cus tomers rating their satisfaction level a  or  on a point scale  those we refer to as delighted  rose  or  million customers across the franchise over the same period more than one million fewer customers experienced problems with bank services a decrease of  in ccb weve streamlined processes for deposits payments and problem resolution in amg associates are using six sigma to boost sales and revenue opportunities and in gcib associates designed and implemented an automated standardized client calling and pitch reporting system to enhance client relationship management and cross sales we have hundreds more projects in the pipeline and plan to more than double the number of six sigma green belt and black belt projects in  the result of all this work is more satisfied customers and clients all of whom are more likely to purchase more products and services from our company and to recommend us to friends and relatives but the benefits go further while we will continue to invest in advertising to develop and support our companys brand  we executed several very successful campaigns this year  we believe the bank of america brand is created in the millions of experi ences that customers have with our company every day every customer interaction  we have more than  per second  is an opportunity to attract retain or deepen a customer relationship and every interaction that results in a delighted customer builds the strength of our brand and our company for the future the promise of higher standards bank of america is founded on an important idea that people are at theirbest when they are striving to exceed accomplishmentsof the past in our company we have long talked about our commitment to redefining worldclass business performance and standards of operational consistency accuracy and efficiency we have long insisted on continuous improve ment and the sustained intensity that drives it promising never to settle for an industry benchmark or our own historical performance we have said our goal is nothing short of becoming the worlds most admired company this drive to excel can be summed up in two words higher standards this is our goal in everything we do higher standards for our customers who use our products and services to help manage their financial lives and achieve their dreams higher standards for our shareholders who have entrusted us with their wealth and financial future higher standards for our associates who have chosen to use their skills and talents here and who deserve every opportu nity to reach their full potential higher standards for our communities which are deeply invested in this enterprise and upon which the future prosperity of our company rests throughout our company our associates are raising the bar for performance consumer

customer and client rela tionships and delivering the financial products and services our customers need to help them achieve their dreams in regard to our focus on building relationships  the foundation of our corporate strategy  i will repeat what i wrote last year we know that we are not the only large banking company pursuing a relationshipbased strategy and that the real game is execution whats different today is the evidence from our customers and on our income statement that we are indeed executing this strategy more successfully  and on a much larger scale  than our competitors while the economic outlook remains uncertain we believe we will continue to buildon our momentum and will be wellpositioned to further separate our company from the pack when stronger economic growth returns in closing i would like to thank our board of directors for their guidance and counsel during a turbulent year in particular i greatly appreciate the service of ray holman chairman of mallinckrodt inc and peter ueberroth managing director of the contrarian group inc both of whom are retiring from the board this year on behalf of all our associ ates i also thank our customers who provide the inspiration for all we do and our shareholders whose commitment to and investment in this company make higher standards an ideal worth expecting worth demanding and worth

22,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2003,higher standards i wrote last year is a phrase that reflects your companys commitment to the idea that in every endeavor there is always an opportunity to raise the bar in  your company promisedand delivered higher standards of performance for customers share holders and the communities where we do business we produced strong revenue and net income gains in all our major lines of business demonstrating the power of scale execution and a sound organic growth strategy we achieved significant gains in customer satisfaction across our businesses and customer segments laying the foundation for accelerating organic growth in the future we responded decisively to a regulatoryinquiry into mutual fund industry practices demonstrating our commitment to strong governance ethical conduct and our core values we staked out a bold vision for the future with our agreement to acquire fleetboston financial corporation and we announced new year goals for community development banking and corporate philanthropy unprecedented in our nations history our vision and strategy for your company has not changed we are building bank of america by offering our customers unmatched convenience and expertise high service quality innovation and a variety of financial products and services delivered as a single relationship we are striving to exceed past accomplishments every day in all we do growing the business one customer at a time in  bank of america was one of six companies in the world to post earnings of more than  billion in surpassing this milestone we increased net income for the year by  revenue by  and shareholder value added by  and posted a return on equity of  beating our goal in each case our efficiency ratio for  was  close to our target of  and a small improvement from  i hope you will review our financial results in more detail on page  of this report and in the financial review beginning on page  these financial results are significant they are the product of the hard work and dedication of thousands of associates whose talent and commitment to a shared set of values give me confidence that we can continue to push our company to even greater heights in the future i am immensely proud of our teams achievement what makes me even more proud is how we got here for the past five years we have followed a disci plined organic growth strategy pursuing growth by attracting more customers and expanding our relation ships with the customers we already have the execution of this strategy has required a constant focus on the voice of the customer product and service quality and process excellence throughout the organization as those of you who have held bank of america shares for the past few years know we have sustained our focus on these priorities by institutionalizing quality and productivity tools and methods across the entire company foremost among these is six sigma which is now being used within all business lines across the com pany to measure and improve the results we produce for customers and shareholders we have been successful with this approach for sever al reasons we committed to six sigma  from the beginning made no exceptions and insisted that the result would be a fundamental and permanent change in the way we operate the company we hired accomplished veterans from outside the company to accelerate results and aggressively trained our own associates in the disci pline we pursue new metrics to gauge the impact of our work and we hold individuals accountable for results those results are impressive since launching our six sigma efforts less than three years ago weve saved hun dreds of millions of dollars in expenses cut cycle times in numerous areas of the company by half or more and improved the percentage of customers who rate their satis faction at  or  on a point scale from  to more than  an increase of almost  million customersfrom a growth perspective the benefits are clear the cost savings and efficiency gains are immediately avail able to be redeployed in growth opportunities in the market and improved customer satisfaction leads to increased revenue that also can be directed to growth opportunities we are investing in these opportunities aggressively in all our businesses from consumer and commercial banking to asset management to global corporate and investment banking you can read about some of our initiatives and the results we are achieving in the stories that follow this letter what these stories demonstrate is that better more efficient more consistent processes lead to better prod ucts and services more satisfied customers and clients more revenue and net income and finally stronger returns for shareholders the numbers are in and the conclusion is clear our strategy is working winning the right way a commitment to winning is a strong part of our corporate culture an equally strong part of our culture is a commitment to winning the right way or as we sometimes say doing the right thing last fall our company was named in a regulatory inquiry into practices within the mutual fund industry in an effort to protect our customers and shareholders and resolve the situation as quickly as possible we immedi ately took the following steps  we launched our own internal inquiry we announced that we will make appropriate restitution to shareholders of any funds that are found to have been adversely impacted the nations funds board of trustees announced the appointment of independent individuals and firms to determine any monetary impact on the funds and we dismissed several associates from the company we run our company with strict adherence to factbased principles of management in which all individuals are held accountable for their decisions and their actions i wrote at length last year about the confidence we have in our gover nance and risk management systems and processes i con tinue to believe our governance systems are among the best in the world even as we work every day to strengthen them we will continue to do whatever is necessary to main tain and build the trust and confidence of our customers associates and shareholders if we find something wrong well fix it and be better for it in the final analysis i believe we will be judged not by the actions of a few of our associates but rather by the way we responded as a team to a violation of our shared values we have no tolerance for decisions or actions that fail to put the interests of our customers associates and shareholders first our actions will reflect this stance in the future just as they have in the past new teammates new opportunities on october   chad gifford chairman and ceo of fleetboston financial and i announced our agreement to merge our companies we also announced that chad will be the chairman of the board in our new company while i will retain the role of chief executive officer this combination of two of the oldest and most successful companies in us banking presents us with a unique opportunity with this merger we are creating unrivaled distribution in americas best growth and wealth markets we will offer global reach through offices in  countries with particular strength in europe latin america and the pacific rim our company will feature increased earnings and revenue diversity creating stronger more consistent results for shareholders it will create enhanced leverage of our technology and process capabilities as well as investments like national advertising and research and development the company will have broader distribution of wealth management products and the management team will be the best in the industry all that said in my mind one of the most compelling arguments for this merger is our vision for a truly national bank that creates the opportunity for americans across the country to choose the unprecedented conven ience quality and innovation we can provide ultimately this merger is about delivering the combined capabilities of two powerful organizations to our customers shareholders and communities customers will benefit from the broadest retail franchise in the nation a shared commitment to service excellence and a full range of traditional and innovative financial products and services shareholders will benefit from our presence in the best growth and wealth markets in america and unmatched diversity of revenues and resources our communities will benefit from our shared tradition of publicprivate part nership community development banking and philan thropic investment in the communities we serve your companys expansion into the northeast marks an exciting new era in our history and the creation of what we believe will be the countrys premier financial institution a tradition of leadership i have said that after we merge with our new partners at fleet we will continue to be a leader not only for our customers and shareholders but for our communities as well this commitment follows a long tradition at bank of america of running our compa ny with a clear understanding of the vital link between the health of our businesses and the health of the communi ties in which we operate five years ago we announced a year  billion commitment to community development lending and investing at that time unprecedented in history since then we have loaned and invested more than  billion in traditionally underserved american communities put ting us on pace to exceed our goal well ahead of schedule this performance is why we recently decided to set a new even more ambitious target bank of america will raise its community development lending and investing goal to  billion over  years starting in  once again setting a higher standard for community develop ment banking in our country in addition we will set a year goal for philanthropic investmentsomething we believe no other us company has ever doneof  bil lion an average annual increase of  over the combined  philanthropy budgets of bank of america and fleet our escalating commitment to our communities is a demonstration of what we mean when we talk about the important idea upon which bank of america is founded that people are at their best when they are striving to exceed the accomplishments of the past its this spirit of constant striving that has driven our country forward since its founding and continues to drive our company for ward in our pursuit of higher standards of performance for our customers our shareholders and our communities in

suggestions ,10.81,1.0
23,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2004,two great tasks defined your companys efforts in  first we accelerated the execution of our organic growth strategy creating value for shareholders by building and expanding millions of customer and client relationships across the country second we acquired and began to integrate the operations of fleetboston financial corporation adding more than  million customers and greatly increasing our opportunities for value creation and future growth in a single stroke some observers outside the company saw strategic conflict or a kind of corporate ambivalence in these two tasks we do not in fact we view our acquisition of fleet as tightly connected to our ongoing commitment to organic growth we said from the moment our two companies came together that our goal was not just to reduce costs but to accelerate organic growth in the northeast and thats just what we have done at the same time the momentum we have been building for several years with our customers throughout the company continued to grow in our retail banking operations continuing improvements to products services and the banking center experience are driving customer delight and revenue to alltime highs in our wholesale banking businesses bankers are working together to bring a full range of investment banking products and services to more of our clients than ever before in our wealth management business we are expanding our financial advisor network and increasing market share across the nations best and fastestgrowing wealth markets while our associates are working within their lines of business to build customer relationships they also are reaching out to work with teammates across the company to create new opportunities to deliver the full power of bank of america to our customers for example investment bankers are working with commercial bankers to provide ma advice to middlemarket ceos personal financial advisors are working with teammates across the bank to help us serve more of our consumer small business commercial and corporate customers with wealth management services and last year we launched an initiative called the fixed income strategies group that enables our global capital markets and investment banking business to distribute fixedincome products through global wealth and investment managements network of financial advisors serving highnetworth and retail clients expanding the suite of product offerings available to our clients all this work is creating strong consistent financial performance for our shareholders you can read more about how our associates are working together to grow the company starting on page  of this report strategic vision financial results our associates are pursuing our vision of a nationwide universal bank for consumers and small businesses a fullservice corporate and investment bank with global capabilities for our commercial and corporate clients and a company that produces strong consistent financial returns for its shareholders by delivering higher standards of service for our customers every day our financial results are evidence that in this pursuit we are winning in the marketplace in  bank of america earned  billion was the worlds fifth most profitable company and with a market capitalization at yearend of  billion was the second most highly valued financial services company in the world our results exceeded our goals in most important financial categories including diluted earnings per share net income revenue and credit quality i hope you will review our financial results in more detail in the financial summary on page  and in the management discussion  analysis starting on page our financial results in  continued the strong returns we have posted for our shareholders over the past four years in fact we have met or exceeded the rising expectations of wall street every quarter since the beginning of  from  through  our diluted earnings per share grew at a  annual rate despite an economic slowdown and market turbulence that derailed many competitors our strong profit growth provides us multiple opportunities for capital deployment which we pursue in three broad categories investments in existing lines of business acquisitions of other companies and capital returned to shareholders our internal investments are tightly focused on areas of the company with strong longterm growth prospects prominent examples include a  million investment beginning in  in global capital markets and investment banking where growth priorities include expanding capabilities in debt sales and trading client management our equity platform and our ability to serve clients needs in europe and asia in global wealth and investment management we continue to invest in sales and relationship management capacity and in global consumer and small business banking were continuing to build out our banking center network as we move into new and fastgrowing markets our most visible acquisition last year was fleet but our acquisition of national processing corporation was a great example of an effort to build scale and capabilities in an existing business the addition of national processing to bank of america merchant services is enabling us to offer more payments solutions to our customers as payments continue to shift from paper to plastic the merchant services expansion has enabled us to strengthen our leadership position in the payments business in deploying capital we have complemented investments and acquisitions with an extremely shareholder friendly capital strategy since  bank of america has returned more than  billion in capital to shareholders through a combination of increasing dividends and the repurchase of shares our dividend has grown at an annual rate of  over the past  years from  in  to  today and our current dividend yield of almost  is among the most attractive in the industry our strategic vision and financial results have been rewarded in the marketplace over the past five years our shares have appreciated faster than our peers faster than the kbw banks index faster than the sp  and faster than the dow jones industrial average with an annualized total shareholder return including stock price apprecia tion and dividends of  from  through  bank of america has been an extremely strong investment growth in the northeast when we agreed to acquire fleet we believed that by bringing our successful retail model to the fleet franchise we could immediately start taking market share from our competitors increasing customer satisfaction and generating growth in accounts and revenue and thats exactly what has happened the results for our first nine months as one company from april  to december  confirm that we achieved what we set out to do for example net checking account growth in the northeast increased from about  in  to about  in  and savings account growth registered strong gains as well not only are customers giving us a vote of confidence with their purchase decisions theyre also telling us their satisfaction is growing which bodes well for future growth between june and december customers in the northeast who rated their experience in the banking centers a  or a  on a point scale increased from  to  we have been extremely pleased with our early results and these results have been gaining in strength since we launched the bank of america brand across the northeast between august and december of last year even so we believe our greatest growth potential in the northeast lies before us not behind us even given our strong results so far our market penetration and share of wallet in northeast markets remains low relative to potential business opportunity this is especially true in global wealth and investment management where we see significant opportuni ties to grow by capturing more of our existing customers wealth planning business the merger transition process itself has been without qualification the smoothest and fastest i have seen in my career from the beginning we planned and executed the transition and all associated projects with strict adherence to a disciplined six sigma approach improving processes driving down costs and enhancing quality and productivity along the way we continue to face significant transition challenges and opportunities in the northeast in  we will meet those challenges and seize those opportunities with the same energy enthusiasm and intensity that led to our success in  and drive toward everhigher growth goals throughout the northeast for the future smart growth to generate strong consistent sustainable organic growth in financial services achieving excellence in sales and service is half the battle the other half is developing the art and science of risk and reward management as a core competency and competitive advantage today your company is developing the skills and tools that enable us to grow by taking the right risks and by getting paid appropriately for the risks we take we are continuing to build a risk and reward management structure and culture of shared responsibility in which every associatefrom frontline bankers to risk managers to auditors is accountable for managing risks to help the business grow this structure is important in helping us manage credit risk but we also apply it to a broad view of risk including market risks and operational risks related to technology systems events or legal compliance and reputation issues we believe industryleading risk management means playing good offense as well as good defense at the beginning of this letter for example i mentioned a partnership through which we distribute fixedincome products originated by global capital markets and investment banking to the banks highnetworth and retail clients through our network of financial advisors this partnership wouldnt work without a strong culture of shared accountability effective governance controls and the active participation of risk partners and the audit group in the business the key message that our associates are embracing is that managing risk and reward is not about avoiding risk its about taking calculated risks in pursuit of growth effecting a shift in our culture that encourages every associate to understand anticipate and manage the full range of potential risks and rewards in their areawhether relating to a credit score a market or interest rate fluctuation a marketing opportunity or a regulatory issueis a fundamental part of our strategy for growth leadership past and future your company is in business for many reasonswe provide the financial capital that creates economic opportunity for individual families for businesses for the communities we serve and for the global economy as a whole as teammates we help one another grow and succeed personally and professionally and of course all our work is aimed at generating strong consistent and sustainable growth in financial returns for our shareholders playing a key role in leading your company to achieve these strategic and financial goals for the past  years has been our chief financial officer and vice chairman jim hance who retired from the company at the end of january jim has been one of the key architects of our company for the last two decades and has been a major ambassador for our company on wall street and a major force within bank of america driving for better results for all of our constituencies i could not have asked for a better partner during my time as chief executive stepping into the role of chief financial officer is marc oken who had served the company as principal finance executive since  marc has a sharp financial mind and a strong confident leadership style that will serve your company well in his new role also retiring from the company is chad gifford our chairman and my partner in the bank of americafleet merger that

first a review of our key  financial accomplishments strong financial performance in  we again set new records for revenue on a fully taxableequivalent basis  billion and net income  billion representing growth of  percent and  percent respectively over last year diluted earnings per share increased to  an  percent rise over  return on average common share holders equity rose to  percent from  percent our greatest financial challenge in  was the con tinuing flattening of the yield curve which is the difference between long and shortterm interest rates as that differ ence shrank banks which tend to price deposits based on shortterm rates were adversely affected in essence profit margins were compressed we expect the yield curve to remain relatively flat in  providing an opportunity for wellmanaged banks to differentiate themselves our strong performance has enabled us to continue our record of returning capital to shareholders  was our th consecutive year of raising our quarterly dividend which in creased by  percent to  over that time our dividend has increased at a compound annual growth rate of  percent as i have always said the bottom line on our performance is our stock price while our total shareholder returns which include our dividend were in line with our peers our stock price fell slightly this year as other stocks in our industry remained flat i believe the two factors that weighed most heavily on our stock were the impact of the yield curve which affects all banks and our acquisition strategy which has created uncertainty for some investors on the first point the yield curve is cyclical it will steepen again and net interest yields will rise accordingly in the meantime we have one of the best teams in the business at managing interest rate risk and i believe we will continue to perform well relative to our peers regardless of the interest rate environment the second point raises questions about acquisition selection price and risk we look at companies that can strengthen our position in a given market which can be defined by customers geography or product we look to acquire products technologies skills or capabilities that will enhance our value proposition with both customers and shareholders of the many opportunities we have evaluated over the past several years we believe that both fleet and mbna met our standards regarding price we start with a sound financial analysis requiring that identifiable cost savings and projected revenue gains will offset the proposed premium we also consider our longterm view of the changing marketplace the competitive landscape whether the company represents a good fit with our business model brand and culture and the benefits that we believe will accrue to our customers and shareholders over time it is in the context of all these criteria that we make an acquisition decision and our track record over the past five years demonstrates both selectiveness and discipline in our decisionmaking process while all acquisitions include elements of risk our company has demonstrated our ability to execute effective efficient and profitable merger transitions we proved this point in the fleet transition which we executed on time and with greater expense savings and revenue gains than we originally forecast i expect nothing less in the mbna transition and i am confident that we will take advantage of the growth potential our new teammates and customers from mbna bring to our company growing with our customers in december  i told investors we are changing the basic thrust of our company from acquisition and expensedriven to a more customer focused revenuedriven organization it would be easy to assume after our acquisitions of fleet and mbna that i have changed my position i have not bank of america has the vision the skills and the financial wherewithal to pursue growth opportunities when and where we find them that fact does not lessen our commitment to attracting retaining and deepening our customer relationships in fact i believe there are three characteristics that give us a particular advantage with customers and prospects operational excellence scale and scope and innovation achieving operational excellence has been a top priority for years and it is most evident in our pursuit of process excellence through our use of six sigma tools since we adopted six sigma as a core operating discipline four years ago we have achieved billions of dollars in savings and rev enue growth shortened cycle times reduced error rates and improved associate performance throughout the company scale and scope in addition to creating efficiencies for investors create a huge advantage with customers our nationwide franchise and unmatched distribution platform enable individuals and companies to do business with us when where and how they choose it also means that more customers and clients can keep their relationship with us intact even when they move their home or business it is a truism in business that real growth requires new ideas our record of in novation lets customers know we are constantly working to create value for them in our retail business last year we hadsuccess with a number ofinnovative offerings weenhanced our safesendproduct making it a freerelationshipbuildingservice that enables customers with a checkingaccount to send moneydirectly to individuals inmexico we launched ourkeep the changetm feature which helps customers save by rounding up debit card purchase amounts and moving the change to a linked sav ings account and we launched our sitekeytm online security feature which has won several awards our wealth management business introduced a new trust product for the mass affluent market last year and our investment banking group introduced a new electronic trading service platform that provides institu tional investors with automated access to diverse liquidity systems and venues while innovation often relates directly to new products and services we also are taking advantage of innovative thinking as we work in teams that span the company to create more value for customers and shareholders referred to generally as universal bank initiatives these projects require integrated planning and enterprise thinking to maximize the value of the company for example the mortgage business system is designed to enable us to originate a variety of asset classes and then move those assets into the hands of investors through our securities distribution capabilities our goal is to expand our ability to meet customers needs across all market segments and create more value for our shareholders by exploiting business opportunities that span the enterprise seizing new opportunities as i wrote above our commitment to growth by one means does not preclude our ability to take advantage of growth opportuni ties by other means in  we again demon strated our ability to act decisively and to maximize the value of the assets we acquire our top priority from the beginning of the year was to complete our transition work in the northeast related to our acquisition of fleet through the spring and summer of  we execut ed major systems conver sions across all our lines of business affecting thousands of associates and millions of customers and accounts all without a significant hitch then in june we agreed to acquire mbna the oppor tunities for growth in this acquisition are significant from product and distribution benefits for customers to revenue opportunities resulting from our combined strengths to cost savings derived from consolidating our operations for example the combination of our distribution platform and customer base with mbnas products affinity relation ships and marketing expertise creates huge opportunities for our company as the largest issuer of credit and debit cards in the country we will have the opportunity to lead in the ongo ing evolution of the payments system in the united states this leadership role will result in many benefits including greater negotiating leverage with partners in the process and the ability to develop and deploy new capabilities and technologies in the payments system also in the early summer we agreed to buy  percent of the stock of china construction bank ccb for  billion with an option to increase our stake to  percent in the future just as important we have launched a consultative effort with ccb through which we will assist in their efforts to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness and bring their financial management and governance processes in line with international standards communities and leadership as we pursue growth we take our responsibility to our shareholders very seriously and in consider ing how we grow we take our responsibility to our communities just as seri ously id like to highlight the work were doing to strengthen our communi ties in two key areas com munity development and philanthropic investment the year  wasthe first full year ofour nationwide yeargoal to lend and invest billion in communitydevelopment our investments in low to moderateincome neighborhoods across the country spur economic development and reflect our commitment to neighborhood excellence this initiative took on new meaning in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita when we

25,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2006,to our shareholders  was another demonstration of the many paths to growth available to your company and our proven ability to drive growth through the competitive advantages bank of america brings to the marketplace our ability to innovate integrate and execute to serve cus tomers needs enabled us to grow our customer relationships last year at the same time our associates again demonstrated that few of our peers are as efficient effective or profitable at integrating acquisitions to enhance shareholder value our efforts were recognized by investors as our shares appreciated  percent during the year exceeding the perfor mance of the sp  index bank of america today is one of the largest companies in the world we were the fifth most profitable company in  with a net profit of more than  billion but while we have built leading positions in many customer segments and product lines in banking our market penetration is actually small given our potential in a number of areas such as first mortgage lending small business lending capital markets and wealth management these and other areas of opportunity are discussed in this annual report our new marketing platform bank of opportunitytm reflects our vision for bank of america as a cat alyst to create opportunities for all of our constituencies from customers and associates to communities and shareholders we are building a financial services company that offers the most convenient banking network for our retail customers coasttocoast and a global capital markets platform to serve our corporate and institutional clients we are building a company that consistently leverages information and market knowledge to innovate for customers and clients that knows how to integrate its operations and businesses to create greater value for customers and share holders alike and that delivers the highest standard of service quality to consumers businesses and institutions of all sizes in sum we are building a financial services company that people and organizations throughout the united states and around the world instinctively seek out to help them create build preserve and grow the wealth they need to seize their opportunities achieve their goals and realize their dreamsin this letter i will discuss some of our strategies for ful filling this vision and i encourage you to review the articles that follow in which we connect opportunities created for customers to value created for shareholders first though id like to review some of our financial results from  strong financial performance yet again in  bank of america earned a record  billion while earnings were up  percent on a  percent rise in revenue much of that increase was driven by the addition of mbna a better mea sure of the years success was the  percent increase in diluted earnings per share adding mbnas results back into our  financial results to create an applestoapples comparison revenue was up  percent in  while we controlled expenses and achieved mergerrelated savings this strong financial performance has enabled us to continue our record of returning capital to shareholders  was our th consecutive year of raising our quarterly dividend which increased by  percent to  over that time our dividend has increased at a compound annual growth rate of  percent we also returned  billion to shareholders in  by repurchasing shares last years financial results were gratifying given external headwinds our industry faced in  in the form of a flatto inverted yield curve and rising credit costs which we will most likely continue to face in  the yield curve continues to be flat to inverted the curve represents the spread between short and longterm interest rates and is an indicator of the opportunity that banks have to generate net interest income we believe we are better positioned than many of our com petitors in this environment our revenue mix is now more than  percent fee income and this change in mix has allowed us to continue to operate within our longterm target of  to  percent annual revenue growth even as net interest income growth has been reduced to low single digits the normalization of credit costs has long been anticipated credit costs have remained historically low across most seg ments of the economy during the recent years of economic expansion as net chargeoffs and provision expense normalize bank earnings will be pressured we believe we are in a good position to weather any cred it issues we currently see on the horizon the breadth of our franchise across geographies market segments industries and asset classes makes our credit portfolio inherently diverse and granular our ability to distribute credit risk through the securitization of various asset classes adds further stabil ity and as our risk managers analyze information about our customers in ever more sophisticated ways we can grow our portfolio without significantly increasing our risk profile in fact in some parts of our business we are actually saying yes to more customers while at the same time improving the average quality of our loans operating leverage is perhaps our most important answer to both the yield curve and credit costs we have consistently demonstrated our ability to manage expenses and produce positive operating leverage  the difference between the rate of revenue growth and the rate of expense growth this per formance enables us to invest in our businesses even when revenue is under pressure the company were building at the beginning of this letter i described our vision for bank of america investors tend to ask tough questions about our strategy that deserve answers first is bank of america too big to grow at attractive rates our answer absolutely not while bank of america is large in the aggregate we com pete in markets  defined by geography product or market segment  in which our current share of the market is much smaller than the natural share we should expect given the size of our company in the retail markets that natural share is defined somewhat by our deposit share in a given geo graphic market examples of product markets in which we have plenty of room to run include mortgage home equity and small business lending i would add that the geographic markets in which we have chosen to compete are the fastest growing in the country providing more opportunity for us to grow our businesswhile our wealth management business is large and grow ing we have a huge opportunity embedded in our current client base clients who qualify for high service levels such as premier or private banking but who have not yet chosen to take their relationship with us to that level outside our existing client base the opportunity is even larger one of the most important moves we made in  to pursue growth in the wealth management business was our agreement to acquire us trust for  billion a transaction we expect to close in the third quarter of  as one of the oldest largest and most respected private banks in the coun try us trust will combine with the private bank of bank of america to create the leading private bank in the country clients of both our organizations will benefit from a more comprehensive set of products and services and access to the broadest financial services distribution network in america us trust brings to this partnership one of the strongest brands in the industry which we are looking very hard at retaining by focusing on these and other opportunities we aim to generate strong consistent organic growth across all our businesses second is bank of americas growth to be fueled primarily by acquisitions or by winning and expanding customer relationships our answer wrong question a better question would be whether bank of america is capable of generating revenue and earnings growth organically and through acquisition and our answer is an emphatic yes the strongest companies are those that have the resources knowledge judgment and skills to pursue multiple paths to growth for the past nine years we have focused primarily on generating organic growth through process improvement increasing customer satisfaction and product innovation at the same time we have taken advantage of select opportunities presented to us to enter new markets these acquisitions  fleet national processing inc mbna and us trust scheduled to close in   add customers capabilities and great new opportunities to grow the business today there is nothing more important than executing well on our current organic growth strategy every other opportu nity pales in comparison to the opportunity we have with our customers and prospects in our current markets and yet our ability to pursue multiple paths to growth is a great strength of your company and will continue to be acquisition  when the likely returns to shareholders are attractive the addition increases our potential growth and the risks are in line with the potential rewards  will always be on the table as a potential path to growth for our company third does bank of america want to be a us banking company or a global financial services companyour answer both we view wholesale financial services as global our com mercial corporate and institutional clients are doing business around the world we cannot serve these clients if we cant provide the global reach they require which is why we have corporate banking offices in  countries around the world and why we are expanding our ability to provide more products in more places retail banking markets are largely local or regional this is why we have invested in building market share within the us markets where we have chosen to compete even as we have divested foreign retail franchises where we felt our presence was too small our preference in fastgrowingforeign retail banking markets hasbeen to invest in the bestrun largebank in the local market as we didin mexico china and brazil thisstrategy enables us to participatein the growth of the market with alocal bank that brings appropriatesize and scale to the table reducesthe operational risks that come with managing a foreign banking franchise and provides the opportunity for us to develop relationships learn from our partners in the market and explore alliances that can benefit customers and share holders of both companies our acquisition of mbna has created something of a corollary to this policy in that we now own a foreign card opera tion that is no  in the united kingdom this business pre sents prospects for growth in existing and new markets and offers additional insight into international retail financial services markets finally what unique advantages does bank of america bring to the marketplace our answer many in addition to our people and our culture which taken together represent our greatest advantage we believe there are four additional key attributes that give us a unique advan tage in the marketplace the knowledge insight and understanding we gain from working with the largest customer and client base in the industry drive our ability to innovate across all our businesses we were named outstanding corporate innovator of the year by the product development  management association in recog nition of our development of products like keep the changetm free safesend business tm and affinity banking more than anything it was client knowledge and innovation that led to our  online equity tradestm which we launched in october  this product enables brokerage clients with a deposit balance of  or more to execute online equity trades with no fee the size and scale of our franchise in the united states gives us a tremendous advantage as evidenced by our sales growth across products and channels last year active online banking customers grew to  million and active online bill payers grew to  million  representing  percent of the market of online bill payers with demand deposit accounts at financial institutions in the united states first mortgage applications increased by  percent and home equity applica tions increased by  percent over  customers opened  million net new checking accounts which contributed to a net new account gain of  million a key differential for bank of america is integration our focus on integrating across the company enables us to create value that others miss we are working to serve customers needs in ways that draw on the power of all our capabilities our associates pursued many crosslineofbusiness initiatives last year but none was more successful than the partnership between global wealth  investment management gwim and global corporate  investment banking gcib by working together to integrate the delivery of financial services to clients with core relationships originated in either business associates in these groups generated more than a hundred million dollars in incremental net income proving that we can create value by work ing together on behalf of our clients execution is a core strength our history and culture of superior execution enables us to get things done right  on schedule on budget and in ways that enhance the customer experience in  we again executed a large complex merg er transition on time under budget and virtually flawlessly for our customers this year it was mbna and our card ser vices business and our capital markets  advisory services business proved itself a major player in the leveraged buyout lbo market participating in seven of the  largest lbos last year including the two largest lbos in history hospital corporation of america hca and equity office properties eop it is the combination of these attributes that is enabling us to fulfill our vision for bank of america  and that enables us to create opportunity and value uniquely for our customers and shareholders in all we do every day whats on tap for  the work we are doing in  will include hundreds of important initiatives i want to mention four broad categories of activity that cover most of them first we are continuing our intense pursuit of growth within all our businesses these efforts include crosslineof business initiatives that create value for customers by com bining capabilities across the enterprise such as a universal decision engine that will bring efficiency and consistency to the credit decision process across a number of our large retail businesses it includes investments well make in our businesses such as those highlighted in the articles that fol low this letter it includes executing our us trust merger transition flawlessly the second item on this list is the most important thing well do this year to drive growth get customer satisfaction scores moving north again regular readers of this letter will recall that in the first three years after adopting six sigma process improvement tools and methodologies across bank of america the percentage of customers rating themselves highly satisfied  or  on a point scale rose on average across the company by  percentage points from  to  percent two years later those scores have hit a plateau in response associates throughout the company worked with customers throughout  to better understand key driv ers of satisfaction and to reassess our efforts to drive satis faction up this year every business has a refreshed plan to further improve customer satisfaction the plans focus on value perception service quality operational excellence and problem resolution and are tailored to the specific needs of customers served by each business each of our major lines of business has established a goal of leading its industry in customer satisfaction within the next two to three years third bank of america has long been a leader in devel oping environmentally sustainable business practices from energy conservation and recycling programs to the financing of green

26,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2007,to our shareholders  was a disappointing year for our company while our financial performance was very strong in the first half of the year results in the second half were severely depressed by rising credit costs and the impact of the unprecedented turbulence in the financial markets despite the shortterm fallout from the socalled credit crunch i remain confident and optimistic about our competitive position and our ability to generate attractive financial results in the future our longterm growth strategy is working and has not changed we are using market insight to drive innovation that creates opportunity and value for our customers and shareholders our earnings power from our core business activities is strong and growing we are bringing innovative new products to market taking market share and expanding customer relationships across the company we plan to invest more in growth initiatives in  than we did in  and we have taken steps to build up our capital strength and liquidity enhancing our ability to be opportunistic in the future this was the first down year our company has suffered during my time as chief executive officer and although i take comfort in the fact that our diversity of income tremendous scale and efficiency will help us weather this storm better than most it has still been a difficult time for our company while the credit crunch and housing market recession in the united states have hit the entire industry hard we offer no excuses for our performance we escaped direct losses from subprime lending which we had exited years ago but we did experience large writedowns in the value of structured products backed by such loans and our trading results were poor as these issues became apparent we moved decisively to mitigate our losses and reposition our businesses for growth in october we launched a strategic review of our capital markets business the results of which i discuss below in my career i have not experienced a business cycle in which size scale revenue diversity and the ability to execute have been more important each of these attributes is a strength of our company each will play a role in determining the winners in our industry and we are leveraging each of these strengths to our greatest advantage i will review some of the ways we are pursuing our vision for bank of america in this letter and you can read in more detail about our work in the articles that follow first id like to review our financial results and the market developments that affected our performance so profoundly a challenging year the story of the  subprime mortgage meltdown and credit crunch is well docu mented so i wont recount it in great detail here suffice it to say that over the past several years a combina tion of low interest rates which helped to create excess liquidity looser home loan underwriting standards at many mortgage origination companies the rapid growth of innovative and complex financial instruments in the capital markets and ratings methodologies that often with hindsight did not reflect the true risks embedded in these securities led to rapid price inflation in us housing  a bubble that had to burst many of us had known for some time that these accelerating trends were unsustainable over the long term we took several steps in late  and the first half of  to adjust our business to evolving market trends but what we didnt know was how and when the cycle would turn fully and how the market adjustments would play out now we know  the failure of several large hedge funds in july caused the credit markets to seize up completely in august all market participants were impacted at the same time and every deal was caught as investors struggled to price risk in the market late in the year ratings agencies aggressively downgraded mortgagebacked securities that had been rated aaa which contributed to the large asset writedowns and financial losses across the industry in the fourth quarter two areas that hit banks hardest were collateralized debt obligations or cdos and structured investment vehicles or sivs both are financial instruments  assetbacked borrowings in the simplest view  that banks and investors have used to fund the mortgage markets at bank of america our exposure in cdos was significant writedowns of the value of these securities reached  billion which was one major cause of our weak fourthquarter performance our losses in sivs by comparison were relatively small the other major cause was the continued rise in credit costs which drove rapidly expanding provision expense  money we set aside to cover loan losses  as consumer credit quality has fallen from historically high levels to more normal levels affecting most market segments these factors were evident in our financial results for the year in  bank of america earned  billion down from  billion in  earnings per diluted share fell to  from  revenue fell to  billion from  billion and return on common shareholders equity fell to  percent from  percent our efficiency ratio which had been in our target range under  percent for the past two years rose to  percent provision expense rose  percent to  billion from  billion as nonperforming loans and leases and net chargeoffs rose to  percent and  percent of total loans and leases respectively the good news is that our core businesses continue to execute their growth strategies in the marketplace with precision and discipline in global consumer  small business banking revenue rose  percent for the year and noninterest income rose  percent we added more than two million net new retail checking accounts for the second year in a row opened nearly  million new card services accounts became a leading directtoconsumer mortgage and home equity originator and extended our leadership in the online banking and billpay business to lead the industry in mobile banking with more than  active new accounts in global wealth  investment management revenue was up  percent for the year as record brokerage income and a  percent increase in asset management fees produced a  percent rise in noninterest income in premier banking  investments pbi revenue rose  percent on  percent growth in investment and brokerage services and  percent growth in feebased assets in global corporate  investment banking net revenue from business lending rose  percent and average loans and leases rose  percent demonstrating that we are making progress in deepening relationships with our commercial and corporate clients it was our companys diverse earnings mix that enabled us to remain profitable despite extremely challenging conditions and it is our continued profitability liquidity and balance sheet strength that have enabled us to sustain our dividend at a time when others have not overall was our th consecutive year of raising our quarterly dividend which increased by percent to  per share over that time our dividend has increased at a compound annual rate of  percent to bolster our capital ratios in the first quarter of  we raised almost  billion in two preferred stock offerings and could have raised twice as much demonstrating investors confidence in our company bank of america will continue to be character ized by strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders tremendous liquidity and a fortress balance sheet and we are still focused on achieving our longterm financial goals including  to  percent revenue growth  to  percentage pointsin operating leverage and  percent average annual earningspershare growth strategies for growth our job in  is to manage through the current economic storm and use our advantages  size scale revenue diversity innovation integration and execution  to position the bank for rapid growth when the storm abates here are some highlights of plans and progress in our three major business lines global consumer  small business banking gcsbb i believe there are three keys to building a winning franchise in retail financial services convenience innovation and service quality convenience is a wellknown strength of bank of america no company is more ubiquitous  we have by far the largest network of banking centers and atms in the united states and we are no  in telephone banking online banking and billpay as well our products are also very easy for customers to use for example our online billpay product won the webby peoples voice award for the second year in a row based on voting by the public and bank of america was named twice on indexcreditcardscoms list of top  consumerfriendly credit cards innovation has become a great strength of our company in part because of the huge customer base that we serve with more than  customer transactions per second we know a lot about customers needs and preferences we invest in the analytical work that turns that knowledge into actionable insight which in turn helps us create new and better products and services that are attractive and meaningful to our customers examples from recent years have been keep the change free safesend and  online equity trades in  we continued to introduce new products with the launch of no fee mortgage plus which eliminates most fees on conforming mortgages mobile banking which enables customers to bank with their cell phones new risk free cd products which include high fixed rates and penaltyfree withdrawals and the new bankamericardtm which offers more rewards points no points limits and the most flexible rewards options in the industry service quality and customer satisfaction of course are critical i wrote last year that after several years of consistent gains in customer satisfaction we had reached a plateau in many of our businesses and that each business was laying new plans to push scores even higher overall scores in gcsbb faced some headwinds from the expansion of our card business  customer satisfaction in the card industry tends to be somewhat lower than in retail banking  but scores have shown a positive trend since last march banking center scores finished the year at an alltime high and overall consumer problem incidence rates from july through the end of the year were down  percent in retail financial services the result of a customer experience marked by convenience innovation and service quality is customer loyalty loyalty leads to a growing customer base and expanded relationships with existing customers  just the right recipe for the organic growth that will drive our company forward in  and beyond global wealth  investment management gwim in many respects global wealth  investment management is one of our greatest opportunities forgrowth this business includes premier banking  investments pbi which serves affluent clients through premier banking and banc of america investment services inc our brokerage us trust bank of america private wealth management which serves highnetworth clients and columbia management our asset management team in each of these groups associates top priority is client relationship expansion  by working with teammates throughout gwim and across the company premier banking serves about  clients  although more than seven million bank of america customers or households qualify for this higher level of service one of the most impor tant investments we are making is to grow our distribution and service capabilities so that we can continue to move qualifying customers from the mass consumer segment into pbi a key measure of success in serving affluent clients is whether they choose to bring us their investing business at the end of  about onethird of our premier banking clients had investment accounts with us that number grew at an annual rate of  percent in  while client balances have grown at a rate of  percent and selfdirected brokerage assets were up  percent one of our best opportunities to expand these relationships is retirement the demographics are compelling the first of the  million baby boomers turn  in  and the over population will increase by  percent by  this is where the money is  trillion in total assets and an annual profit pool of about  billion we are building our team to take advantage of this opportunity the biggest news in our private banking business in  was the acquisition of us trust corporation this acquisition creates the nations preeminent wealth management provider us trust bank of america private wealth management the group manages more than  billion in assets through offices

continue to serve corporate commercial and financialsponsor clients with debt and equity capitalraising services strategic advice and a full range of corporate banking services we will focus investment banking and global markets coverage on areas of strength leading to reduced activity in some structured products and refocusing of our international platform on debt cash management and

primary financial and strategic partner to our clients that continues to be our goal today simply put this business is important to us because we know its important to our clients the changes outlined above will enable us to grow the business profitably and will make us a leaner and tougher competitor where we know we have the advantages necessary to win even before the capital markets meltdown in the second half of the year our team in gcib was reorganizing to better serve clients one important step was to consolidate accountability within global commercial banking for all aspects of client relationship management including client revenue and profitability at the same time we consolidated credit and treasury management product delivery in a new team called global product solutions client satisfaction scores in gcib have been rising consistently  up a total of  percent over the past three years we believe the combination of meaningful organizational change with the results of the

27,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2008, was an extraordinarily difficult year for our company the economy which had struggled for most of the year hit a wall in the fourth quarter posting the largest quar terly decline in gross domestic product since  credit costs which had been rising steadily all year escalated as unemployment and underemploy ment rose sharply we expect credit costs to continue to rise this year trading results took a sharp turn for the worse as credit spreads suddenly widened in the fourth quarter trends in the credit markets are difficult to predict but we are hopeful that a move toward normalcy will allow our capital markets operations to returnto profitability in  these developments resulted in our first quarterly loss since  and a sharp drop in our profitability for the year in view of the challenging environ ment we took a number of difficult steps we cut our dividend  which had increased every year since   to  to lower our expense base we accelerated and expanded our costcutting initiatives the board accepted my recommenda tion that no members of our executive management team should receiveany bonus or incentive compensation for  and to help us close our acquisition of merrill lynch we negotiated with the us governmentto invest another  billion in bank of america in the form of preferred stock i am very aware of the financial bur den our decisions have created for our shareholders but we felt it necessary to maintain our capital strength and stability in these uncertain times despite a year with no shortage of bad news i maintain a positive and optimistic outlook for our future heres why for the full year inthe midst of the worst recession in generations we earned more than billion ranking us second amongall us financial institutions two of our three major lines of business made money global consumer  small business banking and global wealth  investment management and global corporate  investment banking which has weathered so much of the capital markets disruption this past year came very close to breaking even the point is that the potential earnings power of our company is still huge and still growing we made two key acquisitions countrywide gives us an opportunity to lead the mortgage market to a healthier and more stable future merrill lynchi believe is a tremendous longterm strategic fit for our company notwith standing the large losses they reported in the fourth quarter largely due to sharp writedowns in various capital markets instruments i discuss both of these transactions in more detail in a separate section of this letter our top priority right now as the economy continues to weaken must be to build on our capital strength so well be in a good position to continue to support customers and clientsbank of america has been a strong and stable presence in the worlds financial system since this crisis started almost two years ago the actions weve taken will help us maintain and build on that strength so that we can continue to play a leading role in the economic recovery to come much has changed and much will continue to change in our industry consolidation within and across sec tors of the financial services industry has all but stopped with the financial sector in turmoil but will accelerate when the market stabilizes and assets become easier to price old competi tors have disappeared while new ones are emerging structural and regulatory changes are slowing or reversing the evolution of the global markets we are heading toward a simpler more transparent financial services environ ment and a smaller and more humble financial services industry despite all this change  and in some ways encouraged by it  we remain committed to our core vision for this company we are working to build a global financial services company that offers our customers and clients unmatched convenience and expertise highquality service and a variety of financial products and services deliv ered as a single relationship unlike many of our competitorsin the financial services industry we are wellcapitalized depositfunded and extremely liquid we have one of the largest broadest customer bases in the industry we have a diverse collection of marketleading businesses that help support one another through economic cycles most importantwe have a long history of managing successfully through economic and business challenges i am confident we will do so again financial results the deepening recession provides the context for our financial results in  bank of america earned  billion down from  billion in  earnings after preferred dividends and available to common shareholders were  billion or  per diluted share down from  billion or  per diluted share a year earlier revenue on a fully taxableequivalent basis rose  percent to  billion from  billion in  from organic growth and the addition of us trust lasalle and countrywide return on average common share holders equity fell to  percent from  percent our efficiency ratio stayed well outside our target range under  percent at  percent provision expense rose  billion to  billion and nonperforming assets and net chargeoff ratios rose to  percent and  percent respectively there is no question that the reces sionary environment is hurting results in all our businesses and yet the news is not bad across the board the bulk of our losses in  were the result of severe market and economic impacts in three of our businesses in particular mortgage home equity  insurance services mheis capital markets  advisory services cmas and columbia management all of our other businesses were able to gener ate a profit despite the harsh eco nomic environment and two actually increased net income in  within global consumer  small business banking gcsbb deposits and student lending net income increased  percent to  billion and card services which has been bat tered by rising credit costs still man aged to post net income for the yearof  million in global corporate  investment banking gcib business lending posted net income of  billion down  percent on higher credit costs and treasury services net income increased  percent to  billion in global wealth  investment management gwim us trust earned  million down just  percentand premier banking and investments earned  million a  percent decrease due to higher credit costs the ability of our associates in these businesses to generate sub stantial profits in our current economic environment is a testament to their skill and determination and to the advantages of our broad franchise the profitability of these businesses also demonstrates why we value revenue diversity so highly in our business model in times of severe financial stress what financial institutions need more than anything is capital bank of america has for years been among the most wellcapitalized banks in the world but the fourth quarter of  tested even our ability to maintain a deep well of financial resources in early october to shore up capital levels as credit losses acceleratedwe raised nearly  billion through the sale of common stock and cut our dividend on common stock in half then in midoctober the us treasury department decided to use funds from the troubled asset relief program tarp to inject capital directly into the nations banks through purchases of preferred stock at the outset of this program we accepted an investment of  billion we also agreed at that time to accept merrill lynchs initial share of the tarp funds  billion in early january after discussions with federal govern ment officials the government agreed to provide an additional  billion in january to enable the closing of our acquisition of merrill lynch all three preferred stock invest ments will yield a dividend to the us treasury and have repayment terms for the full amount of the investment we paid our first dividend to the us trea sury department on all three tranches of the tarp investment  a total of just over  million  on february  we believe that by accepting these investments we should have the capi tal and liquidity we need to absorb merrills balance sheet and maintain our capital strength through the recession the downside is that these obligations create a significant drag on earnings as we work to pay the governments investment back which we intend to do as soon as possible countrywide and merrill lynch we made two major acquisitions in the past  months that we believe will produce positive results for our company over time we agreed to acquire countrywide in january of last year we knew that we were heading into a difficult eco nomic period in which home mortgages would be at the center of an intense economic storm we also knew that acquiring countrywide would give us the best mortgage technology platform in the business thousands of capable and experienced associates and a leading market position in the united states in home lending  the founda tional financial product for millions of american families in the most prosper ous country in the world the mortgage market needs to be reformed and we are leading the effort to build a more stable home lending industry we are leading the industry by creating new programs to mitigate foreclosures for homeowners under financial stress our decision to acquire countrywide also has put usin a great position to capitalize on the surge in this business as low interest rates bring borrowers back intothe market for home purchases and refinancings and we are expanding our capacity to process new applications all this activity is leading us toward an anticipated customer day one in late april when well begin rebranding all countrywide operations as bankof america home loans in time the housing market will come back andi believe we will benefit greatly from being a leading home loan providerin the country when it does the businesses that came to us as part of merrill lynch are fighting through a very tough environment now but we cant lose sight of their underlying power merrill lynchs wealth management business is the best in the world it has consistently outperformed its peersin revenue per financial advisor and assets managed per advisor combin ing merrills productive capacity and industryleading practices with our traditional banking capabilities and distribution network will make us a very strong competitor in this market we now serve more than  million individual and institutional clientsall over the world and manage more than  trillion in total client assets through more than  financial advisors we will work to expand relationships on the wealth manage ment side by offering the convenience and quality of our traditional banking services and we will offer our banking customers the best wealth manage ment platform in the world nothing that has happened in the past six months diminishes this opportunity the investment banking businessis obviously under a lot of strain andit is likely that many of the marketsfor complex structured assetbacked products will not come back in the foreseeable future but we are focused on serving the capital raising and invest ment banking needs of our commercial and corporate clients and we are wellpositioned to do so our combined business serves percent of the us fortune  and  percent of the fortune global  we now approach the market as an undisputed global leader in whole sale financial services providing clients with lending deposits cash management group banking wealth management debt and equity capital raising syndications mergers  acquisitions advisory services risk management products and securities sales and trading we are already seeing business activity levels beginning to pick up we now have leading positions in markets all over the world and our investment banking team is among the most tal ented and experienced in the business on the far side of the storm were in i believe there is tremendous opportunity in both of these acquisi tions and i am excited about working with our new associates to seize it managing risk and reward we are in the business of taking risk  lending to individuals and businesses to fuel the economy it is also our business to manage that risk our industry as a whole did a poor job on that front in the leadup to our current crisis the institutions that did the worst job are no longer with us those that did a better job have endured but no one i know of in this industry is crowing we all have learned  or relearned  hard lessons the challenges created by the economic and market environment do not excuse bank of americas perfor mance but they do help explain it one of the biggest issues we faced over the course of the most recent growth cycle was the speed and degree of fundamental structural changes that were happening throughout the econ omy new market participants were emerging and growing rapidly including sovereign wealth funds hedge funds and other global investors structured products thanks to advancing technol ogy grew more complex by the day the speed and volume of securities creation and trading increased expo nentially markets and risks grew ever more interconnected and the sheer volume of information in the system that needed to be tracked monitored analyzed and understood led to a grow ing opacity  the opposite of what you want when youre managing risk as we work our way through the current cycle were applying the lessons weve learned the hard way one lesson is that we must not rely too heavily on mathematical risk model ing in assessing risks the models are sophisticated but they are only as good as the assumptions of the people who create them and only as wellinformed as the data we feed into them we have to balance our risk modeling abilities with what we know at any given moment about our customers clients and portfolios a commonsense under standing of economic fundamentals and our knowledge of business cycles and we must have the courage to test the former against the latter when economic facts and risk assessments seem out of balance another lesson is that we needto return to the fundamentals in our business we are producing simpler and more transparent products to meet our customers current financial needs and developing those that will help them when the cycle turns we also are recalibrating our assessments of risk factors like customer credit worthiness portfolio concentrations and market trends to account for new economic realities and we are using new tools to manage all these risks more effectively finally weve concluded that while organizational structure can be impor tant in the way we manage risk it is not the primary determinant of success the most important factors are people and culture when we have the right people in the right assignments  people with not only intelligence and insight but also the courage to engage teammates on thorny risk issues  and when we have nurtured a risk culture that welcomes and encourages debate we usually get to the right answer many paths to growth one of the most important ideas on which weve built this company is that diversity creates strength diversity of businesses revenue streams risks ideas perspectives and people brings strength to an organization that is hard to come by any other way the same is true about growth opportunities the more paths to growth we can pursue simultaneously and in coordination with one another the more likely well be to reach our goals earlier i discussed our prospectsin home lending wealth management and corporate and investment banking we also are wellpositioned to generate growth in our other two main business lines deposits  student lending and card services we already serve half of all ameri can households and were benefitting from a flight to safety a powerful brand and rising customer satisfaction in  average retail core deposits excluding countrywide grew by nearly  billion or  percent custom ers opened nearly  million net new checking and savings accounts forthe year average balances in cds and iras were up nearly  percent and balances in money market savings accounts were up more than  percent in card services we are facing incredibly stiff headwinds in the form of rising credit costs the opportunity we have in  is to increase cus tomer loyalty for the future as we help customers work through hard economic times in  we modified nearly  credit card loans whether by lowering interest rates reducing monthly payments or eliminating fees we also continue to refer customersto debt management programs we believe our approach to helping our customers manage through hard times will pay off in retention and growth when the economy improves last year i wrote here for the first time about our  billion environ mental initiative we believe thereis tremendous growth potential for companies that stake out a leadership position in alternative energy produc tion and conservation to that pointwe signed an agreement with a green technology company that is helping us reduce our energy consumption in all our banking centers across the country by as much as  percent and were supporting ventures that we believe will lead to abundant and renewable energy sources in the future for example we coled an initial public offering for ocean power technologies a company that is engineering new technologies that will enable utilities to harvest and transport energy from ocean waves we also are continuing to support our local communities through both commu nity development lending and investing and philanthropic programs like our neighborhood excellence initiative nei through nei now in its sixth year we have provided support to hundreds of neighborhood nonprofits anchor institu tions and community leaders through unrestricted operating grants and lead ership development programs given the economic environment and the impact that the recession is having in neighborhoods across the country we are working more closely than ever with community leaders to identify the most critical needs and gaps in local assistance programs and ensure that resources are flowing to individuals and families that have been especially hardhit for example in  we announced a neighborhood preservation initiative offering grants and lowinterest loans to nonprofit community organizations that will help borrowers stay in their homes through financial education programs and other outreach activities most important we are not backing down from the goals we put in place last year to lend and invest  trillion over  years in low and moderateincome and minority neighborhoods and to give at least  billion over  years through the bank of america charitable founda tion we believe it is critically important that we support the communities on which our future prosperity depends supporting the us economy throughout  we operated with a strong belief that what is good for our communities and our country is also good for our company  and vice versa although every headline is telling us that banks arent lending we extended more than  billion in new credit during  to consumers small businesses and large corporations obviously lending volume is not what it was at the height of the boom and it shouldnt be were in a recession which means that demand for credit is lower and credit standards are tighter but that doesnt mean banks arent lending in fact were out there in the marketplace making every good loan we can growing our relationships with existing customers and creating new ones we also have been a leader in fore closure mitigation and loan modifica tions as we work to help individuals and families stay in their homes in  bank of america and country wide modified approximately  home loans to avoid foreclosures representing approximately  billion in mortgage financing and we have committed to offer loan modifications for as many as  customers representing up to  billion in financing to help people keep their savings secure weve opened millions of retirement accounts cds and savings accounts all these activities are helping to provide support to the economy aswe work our way toward recovery they also are helping bank of america increase our market share across all our businesses create relationships with new customers and strengthen the loyalty of longtime customers we are taking action to grow our business  and we are doing our part to support our customers ease the credit crunch and stimulate the economy at the same time how we got here  andwhere were goingthe financial services industry has undergone transformative wrenching change over the past  months in the blink of an eye weve seen the demise of the independent investment banking business model on wall street the failure or acquisition of many of the largest thrifts and mortgage lendersin the country and to a great extent the disappearance of some parts of the securitization industry for whathas now been more than a year the industry that emerges from this crisis will look much different it will have accelerated toward the barbell weve been predicting for years a handful of very large diversified global firms on one end and thousandsof small local community banks onthe other credit markets will feature simpler more transparent products we will be a smaller industry with fewer overall employees and claiming a smaller portion of national income and gross national product and regula tion and oversight of the industry will be tighter and more conservative especially in sectors of the industry that were lightly regulated before eg mortgage lending hedge funds credit markets nonbank consumer finance the story of how we got here is the story of every great economic bubble in history every group of participants in the economy  lenders borrowers regulators policy makers appraisers rating agencies investors investment bankers  had a motive to pushthe cycle forward and most did the institutions that gave in completely to the frenzy around them and engaged in the worst lending practices are no longer with us those that balanced the need to compete with the need to maintain prudent lending standards  like bank of america  survive today and have provided a stabilizing effect in an otherwise unstable financial services industry one of the greatest challenges our industry now faces is helping consum ers deleverage their household balance sheets for an industry that became too dependent on interest income to produce profits the prospect of significantly lower consumer borrowing levels can be sobering the answer in my view is for financial institutions to diversify their business models creating a balanced revenue stream that includes both interest and non interest income from a wide range of financial products and services that enable customers not only to borrow but also to save and invest bank of americas diversified business model should be a model for the industry because we offer a wide range of savings and investment products as well as credit products we are not captive to an ever increas ing need for interest income theres great credibility in being able to tell customers you want to help them achieve financial balance and finan cial health when you have the product set to back it up diversification also will be helpful as the regulatory environment changes in the wake of our current crisis a diversified revenue stream naturally exerts a stabilizing influence on earn ings over time which reassures those charged with overseeing the strength and stability of the industry and diversification also protects against changes in the profitability of individual financial sectors due to changing rules and regulations the universal bank model has come under a lot of fire over the past year but my firm belief is that when properly executed the universal model will grow in favor as the strongestand most viable in the industry the successful universal bank will be one that achieves leading positions in the markets in which it competes inte grates operations to create value for customers and creates a strong bind ing culture across the enterprise that supports the institutional mission this is the strategy weve followed at bank of america throughout my tenure as ceo i continue to believe it is the strategy that will enable us to outperform our competitors when the economy finally strengthens looking toward the future successfully executing our strategy and managing through one of the worst economic environments in our nations history will require an extremely capable experienced and tightknit leadership team to that point idlike to review some of the leadership changes weve had over the past year barbara desoer a longtime bank of america leader has moved to calaba sas california where she is leading the team that is hard at work reinventing the home lending industry barbaras experience leading our consumer products and global technology  operations divisions in recent years has prepared her well for this challenge bruce hammonds one of the driving forces behind the evolution of the card industry over the past three decades retired at the end of  bruce successfully led our card services business since our acquisi tion of mbna in  he has been succeeded by ric struthers who helped create mbna in  rics deep knowledge and experience in the card industry will be critical to our suc cess as we reposition that business in a changing economic environment brian moynihan who led our global corporate  investment banking business during  has taken responsibility for global banking  wealth management including commercial and corporate banking and global product solutions brian who led the rapid growth of our wealth management business for several years is now focused on pulling together our teams from across bank of america and merrill lynch as we build a leading presence in these businesses tom montag who joined merrill lynch in  as head of global sales  trading will lead our global markets businesses before joining merrill tom spent  years in a number of senior roles with goldman sachs toms expe rience in securities markets all over the world makes him an ideal leader for our team as we work to build this business we also have welcomed three former members of the merrill lynch board of directors to our board charles o rossotti is a senior advisor at the carlyle group and a former irs com missioner virgis w colbert is a senior advisor to the millercoors company retired admiral joseph prueher is a consulting professor at stanford univer sitys institute of international studies and formerly served as us ambassa dor to the peoples republic of chinai look forward to their leadership and contributions to our company we will have one departure from our board this year meredith r spangler a director since  will retire at our annual meeting when meredith joined our board we were a regional bank called ncnb that operated in just a handful of southern states over the past  years she has helped guide our growth through at least a halfdozen transformative mergers and several business cycles as a member of our corporate governance committee she has been instrumental in guiding the development of the standards and protocols through which we govern the company and she has provided valued advice and counsel to both hugh mccoll our former chairman andceo and me in good times and bad in short during her time on our board meredith spangler has beena constant source of strength and wisdom to this company and its leaders we are positioned to survive this economic crisis and be a global force in our industry in part because of her leadership her presence will be sorely missed and we wish her only the best in all her future endeavors  was one of the most challeng ing years in our companys history  will be a great challenge as well but this is not the first time this company has faced and successfully managed through economic or business crises we have a year history of persevering during hard times and positioning ourselves to be even stronger when economic growth returns despite the severity of our current challenges i remain undeterred i believe that our combination of strong businesses leading market positions diverse earnings power and talented associates will see us through and that we will emerge as one of the strongest and best financial institu tions in the world in conclusion i would like to thank every shareholder for your patience and continued confidence in our team and our company every associate at bank of america is working together towarda common goal restoring this company to a position of financial and competi tive strength i look forward to reporting to you over the course of the year on our progress and as always i

28,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2009,a tough year  was a difficult year by almost every measure as the largest lender in the united states during the worst recession in  years we knew  would be a stern test  and it was for the full year we reported net income of  billion  a good overall result given the eco nomic environment after accounting for preferred dividends and the cost of exiting the federal governments troubled asset relief program tarp we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of  billion or a loss of  per diluted share tarp and other actions by public officials stabilized our financial system and were grateful to us taxpayers for making these funds available we repaid the treasury the full  billion for the tarp preferred stock investment in december government support of our company and the industry also carried a heavy cost for our shareholders in  dividends and fees associated with government support programs reduced our net income available to you our shareholders by  billion at the same time we faced high credit costs in  as provision expense for the year totaled  billion while credit costs will continue to be high in  most credit quality metrics have begun to improve net chargeoffs fell in the fourth quarter for the first time in more than four years we think the economy will gain strength through the year so we expect credit costs to improve despite the many challenges we faced in  we came through the worst year for banks in several generations with net income up more than  over  we strengthened our capital through a series of actions that increased tier  common capital by  billion and we moved ahead on our merger integrations  lasalle is complete countrywide is close and the merrill lynch transition is progressing on schedule and under budget bringing these projects to a successful close is critical as we look forward to putting all of our focus on customer and client satisfaction this year and beyond leadership in a changing industry early in this crisis it became clear that consumers across all our markets were frustrated with their banking experience they wanted clarity consistency transparency and simplicity in their financial products and services weve responded with clarity commitment documents in our home loans and credit card businesses that explain in plain english the terms of each product or service with limited and simplified fee structures in our deposits business and with other changes that make it easier for our customers to manage their finances in our capital markets businesses were working with policy leaders on reforms for derivatives trading securitization and other sectors that aim to improve transparency and accountability we are working to ensure that reforms balance safety and soundness with innovation and allow us to deliver the products our clients need to run their businesses while we have always had a pay for performance culture we have made important changes to our compensation practices to more closely align pay with longterm financial performance and enable the company to recover funds when risks go bad we also have adopted an improved approach to risk management each year the management team will recommend and the board of directors will approve an aggregate risk appetite for the company that management will then allocate across the lines of business weve clari fied risk management roles and responsibilities were putting in place management routines that will foster more open debate on riskrelated issues and were taking action based on those debates before and during the recent crisis many of our collective business judgments missed the mark we believe the changes were making now will put us in a much better position to see and respond to macroeconomic risks in the future we are moving ahead and making changes we believe are responsive to our customers and clients needs and we are urging constructive dialogue with policymakers to make sure well be able to continue to meet the needs of our clients while at the same time protecting the future of our industry growing the right way there is nothing more important to our more than  bank of america teammates and me than our belief that theres a right way to do business  an approach that balances our responsibilities to all our stakeholders this belief has guided our efforts as weve worked to help customers clients and communities ride out the economic storm clearly the most urgent need has been loan modifications to help families and businesses manage their monthly cash flow to get through the crisis weve reported regularly on our efforts to ease the crisis in home foreclosures and we continue to accelerate our work to match the growing need we lead the

investment bank a wealth management firm a brokerage or a private bank we serve them on an integrated customerfocused basis thats our strategy deliver leading core financial products and services to these three groups of customers do that repeatedly leave nothing to chance develop broad deep long term profitable relationships and deliver longterm value to you operating principles to move us forward so we have a vision and a strategy to execute our strategy we have outlined six operating principles that will help guide our activities and focus our resources be a customerdriven company what does it mean to be a customerdriven company it simply means this we are making business decisions by listening to our customers and responding to their needs and preferences retail customers have told us that they want and will pay for value they can see and understand they value clarity choice and a healthy sense of security and control in their banking services we have taken a number of important steps to help customers take control we eliminated overdraft fees for debit cards at the point of sale we created clarity commitmentstate ments that spell out in plain english key benefits and obligations of certain products we offer depositimage atms and online and mobile banking technologies to provide customers with more detailed and timely information our new merrill edgeaccount enables customers to manage their banking and investing activities through an integrated platform and we have developed employee incentive reward and recognition programs that align with our customer experience goals these are important steps as we build a consumer business driven by profitable relation ships some of these actions have cost us revenue in the short term but we also are working to mitigate revenue losses whether due to our own decisions or regulatory and legislative changes and we are seeing immediate improvements in customer satisfaction problem resolution and willingness to broaden and deepen relationships in serving businesses  from our millions of small business customers to our largest corporate clients  the idea is the same we believe we can create more value by pursuing broad deep and longlasting relationships one very promising area involves our work to integrate the way we deliver wealth management products and services with the work we do for commercial corporate and investment banking clients many of our business clients need employee benefits management for example or access to global capital markets and wealth management solutions these efforts are paying off clients consistently tell me how much more they know we can do for them than our competitors as a result they are giving us more opportunities and we are seeing a steady increase in successful customer referrals across our major lines of business in focusing on expanding relationships we exited several businesses that were not driven by the core financial needs of our customers and clients overall we divested assets valued at more than  billion strengthening our capital and liquidity position and allowing us to sharpen our focus on serving customers build a fortress balance sheet maintaining a fortress balance sheet through economic cycles entails strong liquidity and credit reserve positions good asset quality sufficient capital and a diverse mix of core businesses we have been improving in all these areas although we held assets relatively flat last year we significantly reduced riskweighted assets while also taking down longterm debt growing deposits and strengthening global excess liquidity to more than  billion most important we improved tangible common equity by more than  percent to more than  billion and also significantly improved our loan loss coverage ratios a key goal is to strengthen our capital base to meet new regulatory requirements without having to issue additional shares through the next economic cycle basel iii rules as currently proposed will require a common equity tier  ratio of at least  percent by  a threshold we are confident we will exceed pursue operational excellence and manage risk well an important element in our strategy is achieving operational excellence throughout the organization this is where the oppor tunity to build deeper relationships begins getting it right for customers every time is how we build customer loyalty with merger transition work largely completed we now are free to focus resources on driving operational excellence for our customers by upgrading tech nology increasing training and improving effectiveness and efficiency in all the companys core functions operational excellence in risk management is especially important as we continue to build on our work to institute new rigorous risk management controls and procedures through out the organization in combination with the improving economy this work is contributing to our improving credit quality results deliver on our shareholder return model our shareholder return model is not complicated  but it requires consistent and disciplined execution it begins with the fortress balance sheet the next steps are achieving reasonable and sustainable revenue growth from our core consumer businesses in the us faster growth in our corporate and investment banking and wealth management businesses in the us and internationally and tight expense control we believe that consistently executing these steps will lead to less volatile earnings per share growth and steady capital generation the end result we believe will be attractive growth in tangible book value per share and support for a higher multiple for the stock we also believe that the implementation of this model will enable us to put in place a prudent capital management strategy in the near future that pending regulatory approvals includesa higher dividend and stock repurchases clean up legacy issues related to the economic downturn primarily in the mortgage business the recession took a great toll on millions of families while growth has returned we continue to work through issues related to the downturn  primarily delinquent mortgages we are making progress bank of america including countrywide prior to the acquisition has completed nearly  mortgage modifications since january of  to help customers remain in their homes we reached agreements at the end of last year with freddie mac and fannie mae to resolve many of their repurchase claims on mortgages originated by countrywide before we acquired that company we continue to work toward an appropriate resolution of repurchase claims held by private investors and monoline insurers it is important to the economic recovery that the housing market stabilizes that will require moving through the modification and foreclosure process quickly but carefully we tookan important step in this direction in creating a new legacy asset servicing group which includes responsibility for residential mortgage repurchase claims and management of default servicing this change will clear the way for leaders in our home loans business to focus on building the leading mortgage origination business in the country in addition to mitigating mortgage issues we also reduced certain capital markets risk expo sures that were originated prior to the downturn to  billion in  be the best place for people to work we want to be the best place for our teammates to achieve their professional goals while helping build the worlds finest financial services company for our customers and shareholders to meet this goal we are aligning our training reward and recognition programs to our customer strategy we made changes to our benefits programs to make health care cover age more affordable for most of our employees and we continued to strengthen our leading diversity and inclusion programs to ensure that every member of our team can achieve his or her potential we also conducted a companywide employee survey  percent of our employees participated that led to valuable feedback about what we can do to build an even more engaging workplace focused on the future our  results show that while we have made progress in strengthening the balance sheet and focusing our capital to support core capabilities for customers the overhang of issues related to recent acquisitions and regulatory changes remained significant excluding two noncash nontax deductible goodwill impairment charges we earned  billion for the full year including these charges we posted a net loss of  billion even so the underlying results show the strength and promise of the company credit costs fell resulting in a reduction of provision expense to  billion from  billion in  deposit balances reached a record  trillion at the end of the year showing that customers continue to see our company as a trusted and stable partner and referrals among our businesses are increasing demonstrating the power of our relationshipbased customercentered strategy as i wrote above our company is much stronger today than it was a year ago as we made tough decisions in  aimed at putting issues related to the recession behind us we have the number one or number two market position in almost every business in which we choose to compete we serve millions of consumers businesses and institutional investors eachof which provides an opportunity for us to expand our relationship with them we are leaving nothing to chance in our efforts to pursue these opportunities for your

30,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2011,to our shareholders in  in the face of significant challenges we made great strides in transforming our company we streamlined our businesses built capital and liquidity and most important maintained or builton marketleading capabilities to serve our customers and clients core financial services needs our com pany has reduced risk and is less complex as a stronger more straightforward company we are building deeper relationships with our customers and clients and are doing what we can to help restore confidence and strength to our economy in  we established a clear goal  to be the finest financial services firm in the world in the eyes of our custom ers our employees and each of you as shareholders there is ample evidence that we are making progress on the course we set our focus and strategy are clear we deliver to three groups of customers and clients the leading capabilities they need to manage their financial lives and businesses simply put we can do more for people companies and institutional investors than any other financial services company and day after day we are proving it in the marketplace our financial results for  show both the progress we have made and the challenges that remain for the full year the company reported net income of  billion or  per diluted share compared with a net loss of  billion or  per diluted share in  revenue net of interest expense on an fte basis declined  percentto  billion reflecting among other things increased reserves for mortgagerelated matters obviously our stock price does not yet reflect the work we are doing to strengthen capital reduce risk and attract more business from our customers there are many issues weighing not only on us but on the entire financial services industry these include concerns about the global economy a sustained period of nearrecord low interest rates the implementation of new regulations and capital requirements how these new rules may affect our ability to deliver for our customers and clients and the time it will take to resolve mortgage issues there is more work to do but today we are better organized to serve our customers and clients to offer customers more reasons to do more business with us to earn the profits our shareholders expect and to contribute to economic growth in all of the communities we serve continue to build a fortress balance sheet when we set out to transform our company two years ago our first urgent challenge was to strengthen our foundation  the balance sheet we focused on selling noncore assets increasing capital ratios building liquidity and reducing risk let me highlight a few examples of our progress on december   our tier  common capital ratio was  percent up  basis points from the end of  and double the level in  as we headed into the economic crisis during  we increased our global excess liquidity sources by  billion to  billion and we improved our timeto required funding which measures the length of time that our parent company could pay all unsecured contractual obligations without tapping external sources of funds to  months from  months we also reduced our risk in  by decreasing risk weighted assets by  billion to  trillion including reducing legacy risk exposures in our global banking  markets business by  percent to  billion the result is a stronger leaner company better prepared to handle economic uncertainty the second urgent challenge we addressed was resolving issues related to the mortgage crisis in january  we announced agreements with fannie mae and freddie mac to resolve representations and warranties repurchase claims involving certain residential mortgageloans sold to them by entities related to countrywide in april we announced an agreement with assured guaranty ltd to resolve all of the monoline insurers outstanding and potential repurchase claims involving  first and secondlien residen tial mortgagebacked securitization rmbs trusts where assured guaranty provided financial guarantee insurance in june we announced an agreement to resolve nearly all of our countrywideissued firstlien rmbs repurchase exposure with respect to  trusts with an original principal balance of  billion and in march  we joined with the four other largest us mortgage servicers in reaching global settlements to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination servicing and foreclosure practices the progress weve made on these issues covers a significant portion of our exposure to issues related to the mortgage crisis and housing downturn and while we still have more work to do on these exposures and other mortgagerelated matters we ended  with almost  billion in reserves to handle the costs of mortgagerelated representations and warranties claims resolving these and other claims will take time but we are moving through these issues aggressively and resolving them in the best interest of our shareholders  settling when appropriate and contesting them when we believe that is the right course there is considerable disclosure on our mortgage exposure in the financial review section of this report and i encourage all shareholders to review this section having made so much progress on the two urgent challenges of balance sheet strength and mortgage issues our company is now better positioned to deliver on all our operating principles as we move forward in  being customerfocused being customerfocused in the broadest sense simply means being responsive to the needs of customers and clients  providing the products and services they want when how and where they want them to do this more effectively we conducted an important reorganization of our company in  when we namedtwo executives to newly created roles as cochief operating officers the intent of this reorganization was to better align our operating units to serve our three groups of customers david darnell a year veteran of the company who has led many of our businesses during his tenure is responsible for those businesses that serve retail customers wealthy clients and small businesses in the us tom montag who has led global wholesale financial businesses for more than  years is responsible for all of our businesses that serve medium sized to large companies and institutional investors worldwide retail customers put a premium on convenience clarity choice and value over the past two years we have overhauled the design of our products and services to emphasize these attributes our customers have responded average deposit balances across our retail businesses grew by  billion in  to nearly  billion and we continued to see growth in consumer spending in our credit and debit card businesses we also continued to help distressed mortgage customers either by modifying loans to create sustainable longterm solutions or by helping them through a dignified transitionto new housing we have now modified more than  million mortgage loans since the beginning of  and bank of america is now responsible for about one in three mortgage modifications in the country this work is helping individual borrowers and supporting the recovery of the housing markets and the broader us economy we originated  billion in small business loans and commit ments in  and we hired more than  new small business bankers during the year to further support small business customers we expect to reach our goal this year of adding  small business bankers to serve these customers and help our economy keep growing we provided our affluent clients with a full set of investment management brokerage banking retirement wealth structur ing and trust services through our merrill lynch global wealth management us trust and merrill edge businesses in  we continued to invest in these businesses to ensure we meet our clients needs with the addition of more than  wealth advisors to our team our longterm flows of assets

well risk management is an integral part of our business opera tions our goal is to set a tone and create a risk management culture in which every employee is empowered to raise an issue or express a

businesses this includes seven major categories credit risk market risk operational risk compliance risk liquidity risk strategic risk and reputational risk we are putting specific emphasis on improving operational risk awareness and execution throughout the company this year finally we are clear about accountability  all employees understand their obligation to speak up if they have a

evaluations will conclude this april deliver on our shareholder return model ultimately we will be judged by our ability to generate profits and by our stock price which as ive said clearly does not yet reflect much of the work we are doing or the progress we have made one important measure of our progress is tangible book value which at  per share at the end of  held steady over the course of the year even as we significantly added to our reserves for mortgagerelated exposures looking ahead while our results in  were lower than we would expect in a more normal environment we are making progress in rebuilding profitability in all our core businesses with the economy slowly but steadily improving we believe this trend should continue in  this year will bring its own mix of successes and challenges but our direction is clear we will continue to focus intently on what we can control providing our customers and clients with the best service and most comprehensive financial services solutions in the market managing our costs and doing our part to keep the economy moving forward our longterm value will come through when we do that as we proceed i would like to thank our employees

31,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2012,to our shareholders three years ago we started ona path to make bank of america a less complex and stronger company at the heart of our plan was a strategy to focus on the three groups of customers we serve  people companies and institutional investors  and to become their primary financial services partner doing so required that we focus along two fronts we had to strengthen our foundation and work through the issues that arose aer the economic downturn of  and were obscuring the promise and potential of our company at the same time we established a clear strategy to only do what is core for the customers and clients we serve to be the best in those areas and drive growth in addressing those issues and executing our strategy we have transformed our company a strong foundation we built a fortress balance sheet that gives us the platform to accelerate business growth we reduced longterm debt by nearly  billion from the end of  while maintain ing significant excess liquidity of  billion our capital is at industryleading levels we ended theyear with a tier  common capital ratio under basel  of  percent a more than  percentage point improvement from three years ago although the industry has until  to meet the more stringent requirements of the basel  standards our estimated tier  common capital ratio under those standards today exceeds the minimum requirement  six years before full implementation we have simplified our company and we have more than adequate capital to support our strategic plans we are well positioned to return excess capital to our shareholders and we believe that buying back common shares is the best way to continue to drive valuefor our shareholders we have narrowed our focus to concentrate on the busi nesses and services that matter most to our customers and clients we divested more than  billion of assets in non core activities with no meaningful impact to core earnings and large improvements to capital ratios and liquidity we continue to reduce risk throughout the company while maintaining a strong risk management culture credit risk measurements continued to improve in  loss rates were at their lowest levels in several years reflecting improvements in credit quality across major consumer and commercial portfolios two years ago we began a program we call new bac to solicit thousands of ideas from our own employees on how to streamline the company be more efficient in our opera tions reduce the red tape amongst ourselves and with our customers and ultimately to decrease our expenses that work is well under way in addition we are focused on reducing expenses in our legacy assets  servicing business we have made significant progress reducing the number of delinquent mortgage loans and helping more than  million customers avoid foreclosure with modifications short sales and other programs in  the number of  day delinquent loans declined by  percent to

servicing as we reduce costs we are investing in many areas of the company  including our industryleading online and mobile banking platforms and in growth areas such as small business mortgage and

geopolitical uncertainties continued to surface causing markets companies investors and consumers to respond to volatility almost at a moments notice and our industry continued to face increasing demands for higher capital and liquidity as well as changes to our business models we started to address many of these issues five years ago  we trimmed hundreds of billions of dollars in assets from our balance sheet eliminated dozens of noncore businesses and increased our capital and liquidity so we could survive and operate in whatever crisis may arise we also made tremendous progress on rightsizing our cost base for the revenue environment and managed risk well also we settled most of the remaining issues related to the financial crisis particularly in the mortgage space several issues continue to dominate the discussion around our industry including too big to fail questions about resolution plans and new regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity in addition the need

customer does with us the more value we can provide them this has been very successful in terms of assets gathered but also in terms of improved customer satisfaction at the same time we continue to simplify our consumer business this includes fewer but better offerings overdraft policies and products that are fair and helpful to our customers and our own improvements in efficiency last year we reduced our consumer operating costs to a new low of less than  percent of total deposits compared with about  percent a few years ago alongside the simplification work we are investing in additional sales capacity to make it easier for our customers to interact with us and ensure were making all of our capabilities readily available weve added thousands of sales specialists over the past several years and invested in new technologies including tablet technology to help them serve our customers weve also invested in new retirement and financial planning capabilities and additional atms with teller assist all of this allows for better service and more automation we are expanding our retail and preferred businesses to markets we havent served principally because a predecessor institution did not serve them we opened our first financial center in denver in  and we are opening one in minneapolis soon we had a wellestablished presence in those markets already serving clients in our other businesses merrill lynch us trust business banking global commercial banking and global corporate and investment banking as well as retail customers with a mortgage or credit card for many years having financial centers in these markets lets us better serve our customers and clients from wellintegrated modern branches equipped with the best technology and a welltrained sales force merrill lynch and us trust our global wealth and investment management businesses had another strong year in  the team produced record revenue of  billion and net income of  billion with strong margins client satisfaction continues to improve and advisor attrition remains very low together these businesses have  trillion in customer assets up  percent from the prior year we had record asset management fees strong client and market flows and increased loan balances these businesses continue to both provide and derive value through their affiliation with our broader company we see examples of this everywhere for instance about percent of new household clients that merrill lynch gained this year came as referrals from our other business lines this shows the power of connecting our businesses and were just beginning serving businesses from the smallestto the worlds largest companiesmoving to the businesses that serve companies of all sizes we see continued progress we serve these clients through three lines of business business banking global commercial banking and global corporate and investment banking business banking clients are smaller companies operating primarily in the us while clients in global commercial banking operate in theus and globally more on that below global corporate and investment banking clients are companies we serve globally together these businesses reported as global banking in our segment reporting accounted for about  billion in revenue nearly  percent of our total and  billion in net income a word about how these clients are changing in general a significantly higher number of companies we serve are operating globally than in previous times while global corporate and investment banking clients have been active around the world for many years we are seeing more of our us middlemarket clients in our global commercial banking business doing so were even seeing global activity among the smaller companies our business banking teams support some of these companies are looking to access capabilities and resources outside the us others are establishing manufacturing facilities nearer to the countries where they are selling their products reducing the cost of delivery of their goods to overseas markets others are accessing more markets for their americanmade products serving these increasingly global small and mediumsized companies takes global capabilities  cash management or with our sales and trading capabilities helping these companies protect against currency fluctuations and counterparty risk our approach to serving these companies is the same as our approach to the individuals we serve  connect all of our capabilities to help them achieve their goals being able to do that globally puts our company at a competitive advantage with these clients our businesses that serve these clients provide great earnings stability to you as shareholders as we use our balance sheet to help clients prosper and benefit the economies in which they operate lending and cash management services provide strong returns our global markets capabilities also serve these clients by helping them raise capital efficiently and effectively in the us and around the world as ill discuss we have sized our capital markets capabilities to serve clients not to take outsized proprietary trading positions those capabilities provide direct benefit to companies of all sizes helping them access markets and grow this is an efficient method of contributing to global economic growth we also continue to invest and help business clients by offering the best means of managing their capital and making it easier for them to transact with their own customers with our cashpro online payment application we have created a better more efficient experience for our clients and lowered our own costs by retiring aging payment technology this is just one example of the focus we have to be simpler and to drive operational excellence the results of these investments are seen in many ways including recognition by global finance magazine as best bank for cash management in north america for the fifth consecutive year our integrated approach makes it more convenient for business clients to do more with us in the work we do for our larger global corporate and investment banking clients our teams advised on three of the top five global mergers in  other indications of greater activity with these clients are seen in higher average loan balances which increased  billion last year to  billion and higher average deposit balances which grew  billion last year to  billion also we are doing more for our business clients throughour merrill lynch and us trust teammates working withour commercial bankers for example the number of funded institutional retirement plans purchased by companies we serve grew by  percent last year generating assets of nearly  billion in addition we have had thousands of commercial and corporate clients bring their private assets into ourglobal wealth and investment management businessesour teams serving business clients are collaborating across our franchise to deliver all of our industryleading products and services as i said above this work is just beginning balanced global markets capabilities serving institutional investorsalongside the progress we are making in serving individuals and companies our third group of clients  institutional investors  continues to benefit from the investment we are making in our sales and trading team and in our research platform of  analysts for the fourth consecutive year bank of america merrill lynch was ranked the no  research firm in the world by institutional investor magazine we have reduced risk in global markets sales and trading operations over the past several years at the time of the bank of america merger with merrill lynch the markets business had assets of nearly  trillion and at the end of the year we were below  billion all measures of risk in the business were low in  and down significantly from a few years ago our mix of activities has changed too most importantly our focus is on enabling our investor clients to provide the capital and liquidity to companies and markets around the world not taking our own trading positions we do this by serving as the intermediary between our issuer clients companies issuing debt or equity and our investor clients pension and retirement funds for example looking for growth and overall returns we also see synergy with our wealth management clients in the research we provide to help them make investment decisions these industryleading platforms  providing ideas and analysis for investors executing transactions in markets around the world and helping companies raise capital and grow  drive the real economy in the us and globally all the while the team continues to reduce risk simplify the business and produce higherquality revenue and profits our goal is simple we do not need to be the largest in the business but we want to be the best for the clients we serve a final thought on global markets some years ago we decided to report the results each quarter in global markets as itsown segment we did this because we knew as we limited its size and scope relative to the rest of our company investors in our company need to see that it remains a stable and solid performer even after applying the postcrisis rules and regulations to our operations reporting global marketsresults separately also helps to highlight the seasonality and marketrelated changes in earnings that can affect this business from quarter to quarter as we reduced the scope of activity in this business and aligned the business more closely to our client activities we also brought our operating costs to a fundamentally lower level this helps us to achieve acceptable returns in the business even at lower revenue levels finally isolating the results in the global markets business allows shareholders a clearer perspective on the steady consistent nature of the returns we see in our wealth management and commercial or corporate banking businesses which derive synergies from the capabilities in global markets as described above quite apart from the volatility in the sales and trading businesses in global markets a strong company making steady progress in addition to the increased customer and client activity we are seeing in all eight of our lines of business we continue to focus on the fundamentals balance sheet  we strengthened an already strong andliquid balance sheet in  ending the year with record capital and liquidity levels last year we increased our common stock dividend for the first time since  and on march  we announced plans to return additional capital to our shareholders expenses  we completed the industrys largest costsavings program achieving  billion of annualized savings we continued to reduce expenses in our mortgage servicing unit noninterest expense excluding litigation declined  billion last year to  billion we know we have more work ahead credit quality  credit costs ended the year at a decadelow level net chargeoffs declined  percent to  billion and the provision for credit losses declined  percent to  billion we have achieved this through highquality underwriting as you review this annual report id like to leave you with a few final thoughts we have built a company with leading market positions across every core customer segment served by our eight lines of business we built disciplined processes to ensure we are connecting our customers and clients with all the things we can do to help them live their financial lives  getting more from the whole than is achievable from the parts and we are mindful of managing our expenses tightly to create the operating leverage we need to keep investing in our businesses and to return excess capital to shareholders over time finally through such innovations as green bonds social impact investing products and safebalance banking which helps customers avoid overdrafting we are guided by the principles of simplicity transparency and fairness in our business practices this focus on businessdriven corporate social responsibility helps to maintain the trust of our communities and customers delivering responsible growth with this progress we are well positioned to continuebuilding our responsible growth platform into  andbeyond responsible growth has several key tenets basedon the premise that we know we must continue to win inthe market by meeting the core financial services needs ofour customers and clients we will ensure that our growth is customerdriven and is connecting them to the real economyin the markets where we operate responsible growth also means that we must continue to operate within the appropriate risk parameters and finally responsible growth must come from activities that are sustainable meaning we have built the scale and the processes to ensure operational excellence and continued innovation in how we deliver services to our customers and clients before closing i would like to note the retirement from our board of chad holliday chad joined our board in  and became chairman in  he guided the board during a transformation of our company i thank him for his service and dedication to our company on behalf of my more than  teammates here at bank of america thank you for your investment in our company i look forward to reporting our progress to you throughout the year ,5.52,0.0
34,Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2015,to our shareholders thank you for investing inbank of america in  your company earned nearly  billion and returned nearly  billionin capital this progress is the result of continued strong business performance no longer clouded over by heavy mortgage and crisisrelated litigation and operating costs over the past several years weve followed a strategy to simplify the company rebuild our capital and liquidity invest in our company and our capabilities and pursue a straightforward model focused on responsible growth at the core of our strategy is the commitment we made to a clear purpose to make financial lives better by connecting those we serve to the resources and expertise they need to achieve their goals this is what drives usbefore reviewing our progress i want to highlight a couple of important points our board of directors regularly reviews our strategy the environment in which we are operating and the progress we are making toward the goals we set our lead independent director jack bovender discusses this in his letter to shareholders on the previous page and in our  proxy statement you may also read more about our company in our business standards report which discusses in further detail how we live our purpose and the approach we take to fulfilling our responsibilities in the areas of environmental social and governance esg in  your investment in the company measured by tangible book value per share was at a record  that figure has increased in each of the past five years and is up  percent in that period  and that is after nearly  billion of stock repurchases and dividends paid our return on assets roa was  percent our longerterm target is  percent the gap shows we still have work to do however our target is realistic driven by continued loan growth and good core expense management expenses excluding the large drop in litigation were down nearly  billion last year and we expect expenses to decline again in  in december we saw the first increase in shortterm interest rates in nearly a decade and while interest rates are still a long way from normal this move reflects a steadily improving us economy which has continued into early  we see consumers spending and businesses growing and its our job to help them we will continue to drive the core business growth even in a belowtrend economic environment in the us and around the world the  billion we earned in  reflected progress acrossa range of measures loan growth business activity capital liquidity credit improvement and cost management here are just a few examples of how our team supported customers and clients your company grew core loan balances by  billion and deposit balances by  billion issued nearly  million new credit cards and saw consumer spending on credit cards rise  percent funded  billion in residential home loans helping more than  families buy or refinance a home extended more than  billion in new credit to small business owners increased loans to the midsize companies we serve by  percent to  billion raised  billion of capital to help companies grow none of these accomplishments would have been possible without a strong financial foundation we ended  with record liquidity of more than halfatrillion dollars what does that mean in a time of financial stress we could fund our company for more than three years without tapping the markets we also have strong capital at the end of  our common equity tier  ratio on a basel  fully phasedin basis was  percent meaning we are well on our way to meeting the  percent requirement that goes into effect in  partof that requirement is a buffer enacted this year that is equivalent to holding  billion of our  billion in capital to ensure we make it through any downturn that is a strong insurance policy in the meantime we continue to improve the qualitative and quantitative measures the federal reserve evaluates during its annual stress test which determines the pace at which we can continue increasing the return of capital to shareholders another focus has been on managing expenses which were down  billion in  mostly due to lower litigation costs and lower operating costs in legacy assets and servicing las even excluding those items our core expenses keep coming down due to our efficiency efforts at the same time we have been steadily investing in technology expanding our sales force and making other infrastructure improvements that are helping us better serve our clients and grow our business responsible growth when we look at where we stand today our company is stronger simpler and better positioned to deliver longterm value to our shareholders thanks to the straightforward way in which we serve our customers and clients the path forward is clearly one of responsible growth responsible growth has four pillars we must grow and win in the market  no excuses we must grow with our customerfocused strategy we arent going to grow by buying assets where we do not have an underlying relationship with the customer such as mortgages originated by another company our growth will come through knowing our customers and clients and being able to do more for them we must grow within our risk framework this is the foundation of everything we do we must grow in a sustainable manner this means havingthe right business model which sustains investments in growth and innovation while producing good consistent returns sustainable also means having rigorous governance practices and making decisions that are right for the customer strengthen the brand and treat our employees well we must grow and win in the market as weve discussed before we serve three groups of customers people companies and institutional investors in the us we serve all three customer groups and outside the us we serve larger companies and institutional investors this approach has helped simplify our operations and reduce our risk profile our  results demonstrate that we grew across all our businesses for the people we serve this is the best consumer and wealth management franchise in the country we serve  million households and every week we interact with customers more than  million times in the time it takes you to read this letter we will have had more than  contacts with customers your company is a highly efficient depositgathering franchise with the largest retail deposit share in the us no  in home equity lending no  in investment asset growth with merrill edge no  in digital sales functionality and we have the no  online and mobile banking platform within the consumer banking and wealth management businesses deposits grew by  billion or  percent from  that is up more than  billion since the end of  and that deposit growth alone is equal to a midsized usbank weve introduced more ways that customers can interact with us and made it more convenient for them we have more than  million digital customers and mobile banking continues to grow with more than  million users why do we drive these capabilities why do we continue to invest in digital banking why are we tripling our investment in  it is simply because this is how customers want to do business with us our customers deposit  checks a day through their mobile devices reflecting  percent of consumer deposit transactions we would need an additional  financial centers to handle the deposit activity that is currently being done on those mobile devices in addition over  billion in payments are sent by our mobile banking customers each week and  billion is sent via online banking to assist customers facetoface we still have more than  teammates who handle our  million financial center visits a week this includes a growing specialized sales force to help customers with more complex transactions in the past year we added more than  financial solutions advisors mortgage loan officers and small business bankers as we optimized our branch network for relationshipdeepening opportunities our ability to meet our customers needs the way they wantis resulting in strong organic growth across every consumer business category  checking credit cards mortgages auto loans and depositsand we are growing faster than the market even as we continue to reduce costs customer satisfaction is increasing because we are doing business the way they want us to turning to wealth management merrill lynch and us trust are two of the best brands in the wealth management business and have the no  market position across assets deposits and loans as of yearend  our clients had entrusted us with  trillion of their money to steward for them for the year our wealth management business had record loan levels with loan growth of  percent and significantly higher deposit levels our financial advisors continued to broaden and deepen client relationships providing them strong investment advising capabilities along with full financial planning total client balance flows in global wealth and investment management were  billion for the year these businesses continue to integrate the broad capabilities of our company to meet client needs and we continued to invest here increasing our number of financial advisors by  percent last year for the companies we serve our global banking business works with virtually every company in the sp  in many products and geographies global banking has greater market share than our consumer business delivering solid and recurring profitability in  we had strong loan growth of  percent for our commercial and corporate clients and strong deposit growth we also raised  billion in capital for our clients last year these loans and capital help fuel the real economy in theus and around the world helping small medium and large businesses grow add jobs and help families prosper recognizing these businesses we serve are the engines of the economy we bring the broadest array of solutions both domestic and international to our clients  capital raising lending cash management trade financing currency risk hedging lending in local currencies and more this helps companies grow improve cash flow and invest for the future we remain wellpositioned for growth and continue to expand and invest in our teams to develop new clients and build new relationships finally turning to the institutional investors our company serves our global markets business is one of the most capable platforms in the world this business provides capital to companies necessary for growth and serves many of the worlds largest institutional investors who manage savings and investments through pension and retirement funds our presence and global reach in fixed income and equity products allow us to provide them access to investment opportunities we offer these clients our expertise backed by your award winning global research team which has been ranked no  in the world by institutional investor magazine for five consecutive years with competitors exiting parts of this business and capital markets and trading revenue down industrywide the question is posed why have a markets business we have it first and foremost because our clients need our help to raise capital in addition our investors need to find opportunities to put their capital to work the key then is to have a sales and trading and capital markets business that focuses on those missions and avoids the proprietary activities that got the industry in trouble in the last crisis we have reshaped this business to do that it is balanced and its narrower scope of activities enables it to weather market volatility well having those capabilities inside of a large well capitalized diverse company like ours also is safer for our clients and because of our relative position in the business serving clients in the largest fee pools in the world we are able to operate the business quite profitably in all of  there were only four days when our trading business was not profitable the fact remains there are only a handful of banks around the world that can handle the global needs of corporate clients and your bank is one of those so this business is key to our customers its risk has been reduced and it makes money in almost all circumstances helping our clients raise funds to grow and prosper and our investor clients make money for their investors the saversof america by showing them the trends in the markets and providing access to the companies that are issuing debt or equity this relationship between companies and investors that we help create is key to making american and global capitalism work and growing the real economy as we look across our businesses and the clients they serve we have a leading set of capabilities in every area where we operate that is the power of your company that is the strength of the model and the balance we are striking to ensure we are doing all we can for our customers and clients while optimizing our balance sheet to perform efficiently with the postcrisis regulations we must follow we must grow with our customerfocused strategy we have a simple goal we need to do more with our customers by bringing them everything they need to live their financial lives i am often asked why dont you just go out and buy loans and grow faster we wont do that because we want to save our balance sheet as strong and big as it is to serve our customers and clients the relationships we work so hard to develop in addition one of the lessons we learned during the crisis was that a substantial portion of our legacy issues came from loans we acquired that were originated elsewhere one of the ways we drive our customerfocused strategy is through our business integration work several years ago we embraced a local marketdriven approach we organized the country into roughly  market coverage areas at the local market level our teams are working together to look at every customer and client relationship in their market and ask  are we doing all we can for them we have seen dramatic growth in the way we are referring existing clients to other teammates who may not yet havea relationship with those particular clients from nearly  referrals five years ago to roughly  million in  we believe this is a competitive differentiator and we are driving it this approach not only gets us the referrals and the business but also creates a unique brand it creates a global company that feels local last fall after a visit to meet with customers and my teammates in portland maine i received a note from a client that to me was one of the highest compliments our firm could receive he shared how over the last year or so he had seen big feeling small starting to happen somehow bank of america feels like a small bank albeit with incredible solutions for business clients we must grow within our risk framework as a financial services company our business is to take risk in a responsible manner that serves our clients and helps the economy grow whether investing in a small business making a credit decision or preventing fraud nearly every aspect of our work calls for sound judgment and a commitment to doing whats rightfor our customers and shareholders our culture emphasizes that we are one team and we have a shared responsibility to manage risk act responsibly have an ownership mindset and escalate issues so they can be addressed proactively over the past several years weve reduced risk significantly  whether trading operating or credit risk for example net chargeoffs nonperforming assets and delinquencies all improved again in  chargeoffs were the lowest they have been in a decade whats important here is how we did it  by focusing our efforts on core creditworthy customers this is at the heart of our approach to responsible growth to understand our customers and clients well and do more with them at lower risk our risk framework is crucial to our ability to manage risk run our business and grow responsibly the risk framework is not a concept it is a deep set of metrics against which we measure our teams to ensure that we maintain strong risk management discipline we have invested heavily to improve our risk management practices and we are committed to having bestinclass risk management capabilities because we know that managing risk well is foundational to everything else we do we must grow in a sustainable manner building a sustainable company is about how at the core of everything we do we are guided by our principles to make the right decisions that will hold us in good stead today and in the future we think about this in a variety of ways first its important to maintain focus on operational excellence and on the momentum weve built managing expenses we have made significant improvement in decreasing our operating expenses if you strip out expenses for litigation and las which alone are down nearly  billion over the past four years expenses for  decreased more than  billion since  and we expect them to fall again this year this progress is enabled by the investments we make in efficiency for example over the last five years we have reduced our real estate footprint by  percent or  million square feetto put that in context the empire state building is roughly  million square feet weve also reduced our financial centers by nearly  as weve optimized our footprint one example on the technology front is the work we have done to reduce the number of server models we use we started with nearly  different models and are reducing that down when this and other technology infrastructure efficiency efforts are completed in  we will save more than  million in annual costswe continue to identify and pursue this type of simplification and efficiency every day throughout the company importantly we have done all this work while investing in growth initiatives and increasing our sales force we spend  billion each year on developing new technology initiatives this is not to run the platform this is all new development sustainability is also about trust as a company we are rebuilding trust that was impacted during the financial crisis that comes down to everything from how we do business to how we govern our company to how we invest in our communities and to how we treat our employees we made progress in all these areas in the past year in terms of how we govern the company we have a diverse and experienced board of directors that provides independent oversight our board constantly looks for ways to ensure its diversity and strength and monitors corporate governance best practices to adapt and improve when necessary in fulfilling the boards oversight responsibilities our independent directors appointed a lead independent director with responsibilities that exceed what governance experts have identified as the best practices for that position you can review the proxy for more information about board governance another way we think about sustainability is the work we do to strengthen our local economies invest in our communities and be a great place to work for our employees in  this included increasing our environmental business initiative to  billion  one of the largest commitments to finance new energy  through lending investing capital raising and developing financial solutions for clients our company continues to support the us military through home donations job skills training and hiring last year we hired more than  veterans as part of our commitment to hire  veterans and in a tribute to their service of the  homes we have donated nearly  were donated to help returning veterans and their families what makes this special is the volunteer work our teammates put in to cleaning up and getting the homes ready for the new families to support our communities we also invested more than  million in philanthropic investments and our employees donated nearly  million hours of volunteer service to the causes they care about around the world sustainability gives us the opportunity to apply the size and scale we have to do big things and as a global company we have a role in finding sustainable solutions to some of societys biggest challenges one example is the work our team has done with redtm to help end mothertochild transmission of aids in africa we partnered with red because we saw an opportunity to use our size and scale to tackle the challenge and weve been able to do so by giving our employees and customers an opportunity to get involved which is something they tell us is important to them finally and most importantly being a sustainable company means we value our people and give all employees the support they need to build a career achieve their goals and have the resources they need to improve their lives and the lives of their families all that we are and all that we achieve is because of our employees and i want to thank them for all they do we have a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflectsthe diversity of the customers clients and communities we serve in more than  countries around the world to help employees develop in their careers we provide resources and strategies no matter where they are in their career through our recruitment programs and partnerships we are investing in the future by bringing the best and brightest to work at bank of america our campus recruiting has increased over the last several years and last years recruiting class was more than  percent diverse weve also made changes to our benefits increasing our wellness offerings and other family support programs to reflect the needs of our workforce as we think about all the ways we pursue sustainability our size and scale give us tremendous resources to bring to a task  whether supporting the economy partnering in the fight against aids protecting the financial infrastructure or building a great place to work our focus is to use our size and scale in ways that contribute positively to our communities create opportunity for our customers and grow our company responsibly conclusion as we take stock of where bank of america stands today we can see the tangible results of hard work as weve simplified strengthened and transformed our company we have a strong foundation we have a strategy focused on the customers we serve and all the capabilities we possess have come together as an engine for responsible growth that is producing stronger financial results and momentum all of this is made possible by more than  teammates who come to work every day to serve clients and improve our communities together we will continue to take the company forward and deliver more value to those we serve and to our shareholders

percent tangible book value per share which measures the value we are creating for you increased  percent in to  in  we will continue to drive this company further toward our goals we drove these results in part through operational excellence working hard to manage expenses and reinvest in our capabilities we reduced expenses by  billion last year and while we have more work to do expenses are down  billion or nearly  percent from their peak of  billion in  its important to note that we did this while growing the business this created the operating leverage we need to invest for the future we also accomplished this in a slowgrowth us and global economy however as us interest rates begin to rise i am encouraged by what this signifies an improvingus economy marked by low unemployment and increasing consumer and business confidence its our job to nurture this growth and help drive the real economy in the us and around the world committed to capital returns i want to focus on what our results mean for long term shareholder value but a little backgroundis necessary in  we earned the most in our history  billion we had  billion shares outstanding meaning our diluted earnings per share was  we also paid a common stock dividend of  per share or  percent of our earnings now compare this to our  results earnings were  billion but because we had more than twice as many shares outstanding our eps was  per diluted share and our common stock dividend was  per share or  percent of earnings the biggest difference between the two periodsis the increase in common shares and a reduction in the dividend both were necessary to stabilize the company after the worst economic crisis since the great depression and now that our company is stronger we are focused on reducing the dilution and increasing the dividend our shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis peaked at  billion we issued more than billion common shares during the crisis we funded acquisitions strengthened our balance sheet to meet higher capital requirements and repaid the governments tarp investment within  months we are working the share count down at year end we were at  billion shares the market value of our company remains strong as i write this letter our market capitalization on a fully diluted basis is at an alltime high of more than  billion we are also focused on increasing the dividend last june we increased the quarterly common stock dividend by  percent made possible by all the work weve done to simplify the company strengthen the balance sheet and rebuild capital what are the lessons we learned from this first we must grow organically acquisitions are not part of our strategy so we dont have to issue shares second our businesses generate more than sufficient capital to fund their growth we have shed noncore businesses and we have everything we need to serve our clients so we can focus on building stronger relationships with them and optimizing returns third we need to continue to reduce the number of shares outstanding this is essential if we want our stock price to exceed the record highs we have achieved in our market capitalization and in our tangible book value per share and because our stock is trading at a price that is close to our book value repurchasing shares now creates longterm value for remaining shareholders when we buy from the selling shareholders at this level finally by staying focused on these things and executing our strategy of responsible growth we can deliver the returns that you expect from us and continue to return excess capital to you through dividends and common stock repurchases responsible growth is working we will remain on the path that led us to nearrecord earnings in  responsible growth means remaining steadfast in delivering on our purpose to help our customers and clients live their financial lives by connecting them to all of our capabilities this strategy has four tenets grow and win in the

days last year despite the volatility caused by macroeconomic events including the united kingdom vote to leave the european union and the us elections a differentiator for us is our global research

markets business corporate banking and our wealth management clients managing risk well is central to everything we do in addition to keeping a clear focus on customers and clientsour responsible growth strategy includes growing within a clear risk framework so that we can maintain our balanced stable and financially strong platform this means understanding the risk and reward in everything we do and empowering our teammates to share their opinions and ideas so we make better decisions in the last quarter of  we had the lowest chargeoff ratio in our companys history for all of  we grew core loan balances by  percent yet chargeoffs declined by  percent which demonstrates our focus on growing the right way in this report chief risk officer geoff greener discusses how we continue to

that means we must adhere to rigorous standards of corporate governance we must invest in our communities and we must strive to be the best place to work by helping our  teammates achieve their goals and aspirations our environmental social and governance esg practices are cen tral to growing in a sustainable manner a special esg supplement enclosed in our annual report mailing this year provides additional details there is also an extended discussion of our esg practices in the proxy statement let me highlight a few key elements we are committed to best practices in corporate governance including a strong independent board of directors and other measures the board oversees our responsible growth strategy to deliver longterm value for you our shareholders also the board has empowered a lead independent director whose duties and responsibilities meet or exceed corporate best practices you can learn more about how the board discharges its responsibilities in the qa with lead independent director jack bovender in this report and in the  proxy statement we also view the nearly  million in philanthropic investments we make in communi ties around the world and the nearly  million volunteer hours our teammates commit to the causes they care about as critical to creating the conditions for longterm sustainable growth also critical to fostering sustainable growth is the way we invest in our workforce and create an environment where they can thrive as of early  weve increased our minimum wage so that all employ ees earn more than  an hour we will continue to adjust that as we have regularly for several years now in  we also increased our fully paid parental leave from  to  weeks for all new parents we create sustainable results through our simplify and improve sim program as well driven by thousands of ideas generated by our own teammates sim is our ongoing process of simplifying our company eliminating or streamlining our internal and external pro cesses and reducing costs so we can reinvest in future growth its the hard work of our team that makes everything we are sharing with you on these pages possible and its our duty to create an environment that reflects and honors the diversity they represent promotes inclusiveness and the sharing of different viewpoints and provides benefits and career development opportunities so they can continue to grow and thrive helping to drive the economy to continue the strong performance we saw in  we remain focused on executing our responsible growth strategy therewill be external impacts from changes in the markets driven by political and economic factors that we cannot predict we may see changes to banking laws or to how regulations are implemented in the united states and in other jurisdictions where we operate reasonable regulation is important for the safety and soundness of our financial system and we support a review by policymakers and elected officials to ensure they strike the right balance to drive responsible economic growth as always we must be agile and adaptive but what will not change are the principles upon which we run our company in both the near term and for the long term given the current regulatory environment and because of the way we rebuilt our balance sheet and how we are executing our responsible growth strategy we will have excess capital to put to work driving the economy we are lending and we will continue returning capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases there is a discussionin some quarters about perceived tradeoffs between those important objectives but we can do both while growing the company we will continue investing in our business our people and our communities because we understand that when our customers communities and employees succeed we all succeed thank you for investing in bank of america ,17.82,1.0

rapid adoption of zelle enhances the customer experience and also helps us reduce the costs and risks associated with paper checks and cash transactions let me take a moment to explain why digital technology is so important to our future for years we have focused on redefining retail banking and improving the customer experience both in our financial centers and through our digital platforms we call this approach hightouch hightech because it describes how we are following customer behavior to combine improvements in our  financial centers and new digital capabilities to enhance the overall customer experience however customers choose to engage with us in addition to advances in our digital and mobile capabilities which have resulted in digital sales comprising  percent of total sales we are investing to refresh those centers and atms and we are opening new financial centers in areas where we are serving customers and clients but have no retail presence or too few centers in the map

observations about how we operate this business we serve clients around the world who want to raise capital and hedge risks when markets are volatile and clients are trying to manage their business they turn to us for help when markets are stable and there is less client activity or volatility our revenues may be lower as we saw in  we have positioned this business to deliver steady and sustainable returns in either sce nario while taking less risk over the years our performance bears that out in  total sales and trading revenue excluding debit valuation adjustments was  billion down  percent from the prior year however across the past five years and with all of the vol atility in markets and trading activities during that period global markets has delivered sales and trading revenue within a range of  billion and  billion this relative sta bility reflects our leadership positions across multiple products and our ability to maintain the appropriate business mix during

days responsible growth that is sustainable looking at our  business results you can see that we remained true to our responsible growth strategy we grew by focusing on serving our customers and

in philanthropic giving also our teammates spent  million hours supporting and volunteering with local organizationsand chapters it gives me great pride to see what the teams are doing in all our markets you can read more about how we are supporting communities throughout this report including the fourpage feature beginning on page  sustainability has an element of opera tional excellence continuing to improve our company and reinvesting those savings into future capabilities through prior initiatives including our new bac work in  and our ongoing simplify and improve sim program we have simplified our company and made it easier for our teammates to serve customers and clients we have unlocked savings that we have invested back into the company to innovate and improve our capabilities an example of this is the addition of specialists in our financial centers and more commercial and corporate bankers to serve local markets which i discussed earlier as we have continued to invest in oper ational excellence we have reduced the amount we spend each year by  billion since  in  we set a target of approximately  billion in annualized expenses for  which we have reached at the same time our customer satisfac tion scores are at precrisis levels and improving investing in our team to be a great place to work another component of being sustainable is our commitment to be a great place to work in  we demonstrated that commitment in several ways at the beginning of  we reachedthe  per hour starting compensation level after years of regular increases for us teammates im pleased to see that other companies have followed suit more recently influenced by the passage of the tax act in the united states we will continue to review and adjust our start ing wage as part of our commitment to fair and equitable compensation for all of our teammates please look for additional discussion in this report from sheri bronstein global human resources executive about our compensation and benefits including career development and learning and other initiatives to help our teammates see bank of america as a great place to work sheris note also describes our industryleading work on health care and wellness for our team sharing the benefits of us tax reform earlier i mentioned that there was a onetime charge to our  earnings from the tax act however there are many benefits from tax reform that i want to discuss these benefits impact how we will invest in the future and deliver returns to you the backdrop for this discussion is the solid economic growth our experts expect in  as i write this letter our economists expect about percent growth in the us economy with the unemployment rate hovering at  percent or perhaps even lower the driver continues to be the consumer and so far in  we see healthy consumer activity with bank of america credit and debit card spending up strongly so far this year our business clients are showing confidence in a more stable and predictable regulatory environment than in recent years when i think about the impact of the tax act it starts with the broader benefits to the us economy by lowering the corporate rate to  percent from  percent and by creating a territorial tax system where corporate earnings are taxed at the rate of the jurisdiction in which they are earned the tax act allows companies to make business decisions less dependent on the tax considerations necessitated by the prior imbalance in rates between the united states and the rest of the world this levels the playing field for us companies and impacts their decisions in discussions with clients who are ceos of companies headquartered abroad ive been struck by a common theme the united states is an attractive market for them with solid consumer demand highly skilled workers stable rule of law plentiful and predictable energy availability and other factors even so prior to the tax act reforms these clients had no choice but to base investment decisions on the tax effects of different rates around the world with the us corporate rate better aligned with that of other countries these ceos now are considering how to invest in manufacturing and production in the us where the final demand for their products remains so strong because the us consumer economy is so healthy were seeing other economic benefits from tax reform as well hundredsof us companies have provided bonuses wage increases and increased matches to retirement savings plans to millions of american workers at bank of america more than  percent of employees have received a one time payment as a direct result of us tax reform impacting about  teammates in the us and overseas in addition we will continue to invest in our company in a balanced way that focuses on improving our connection with customers while increasing our competitiveness and sustainabilitywe are expanding our financial center presence as i discussed earlier we are investing in new technology and innovation across all our businesses all these investments create jobs too we will look to these and other areas as we continue to grow and the benefits of tax reform play out as these benefits are realized it is also important that we retain our longterm focus on addressing the federal debt and ensuring the us remains a fiscally strong competitive global leader committed to strong corporate governance let me conclude by discussing how the man agement team and the board of directors work together to advance your investmentin bank of america effective corporate gov ernance is a tenet for sustaining responsible growth you are represented by a strong independent board our lead independent director jack bovender and the other directors meet regularly with management regulators

same inflation and cost challenges all employers do eg benefit increases wage increases real estate cost increases more investment we managed through them we achieved our  expense target of approximately  billion we set that goal in mid when our annual expense run rate was  billion managing expenses well has contributed to four straight years of positive operative leverage and allowed us to grow pretax earnings at  percent in   all while investing in the company i have mentioned some of the areas in which we are investing adding relationship managers for our global banking clients continuing to improve on our leading digital and mobile capabilities for all client segments and for our teammates investing in health and wellness benefits for employees our philanthropy increase and the shared success bonuses we paid to  percent of our teammates in  since  we have invested roughly  billion in new technology initiatives this includes reworking effectively all of our major systems and adding innovative capabilities while also building an internal cloud and software architec ture for maximum efficiency and speed to market technology investments are directed at innovation across our company perhaps that is most apparent in the invest ments we continue to make in our industryleading online consumer platform and stateoftheart branch network ericatm is one example our virtual banking assistant that combines interactive communications and artificial intelli gence ai to learn and anticipate client needs is unique in the industry since we introduced erica in spring  more than

expenses to remain flat even while we are making these investments that makes our growth sustainable so we wont have to pull back in times of slower economic growth committed to strong governance please read the letter from jack bovender our lead inde pendent director for a description of how the board of directors supports and oversees our strategy jack and our directors continue their practice of systematic investor engagement in  we met with shareholders holding more than  percent of our shares jack discusses this in further detail in his letter on the next page we were pleased to welcome back to the board last yeardr clayton s rose who served as a director of our company from  until  clayton was named president of bowdoin college in brunswick maine in  he was able to rejoin our board last year and offers terrific perspective we benefit from his insight on a range of issues operating at scale to addressimportant societal prioritiesearlier i referenced challenges related to affordable housing clean water education health care renewable energy energy efficiency and other critical areas outlined in the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs the way i think of this is that in effect we asked the world through the efforts of the united nations what would you like the power to do and the world spoke society would like to see timely progress in addressing these priorities the issues are of course a concern to policymakers and elected officials at every level of government but they are also a concern to our teammates our customers and clients the communities we serve and our shareholders at bank of america we realize there is a significant gap between the capital that must be applied to these global challenges and the amount that is currently being spent credible estimates of what is needed to address the un sdgs is about  trillion per year the current annual funding gap is as much as half that government alone cant solve these challenges the us government with the largest economy in the world will spend more than  trillion this year but almost twothirds of those total expenditures are committed to nondiscretionary needs funding the social safety net servicing us debt and other commitments the discretionary elements of the budget include national security education health care and other priorities the same is true for other governments and econ omies around the world the government budgets are fully committed and in many cases in difficult shape so counting on governments to spend more is not a likely solution charitable giving alone also cannot fill the need annual giving from individuals foundations and corporations is spread across many worthy causes and even in the aggregate falls short the us is the largest philanthropic giver in the world as a percentage of gdp total giving to charitable organiza tions overall in the world was around  billion in  and  billion in the us primarily from individuals assets by foundations in the world are estimated at about  trillion nearly half of that is held by foundations in the us at  billion again even if we spent all that money in a single year it would be insufficient to close the gap we operate in nearly  cities towns and communities consolidated into  distinct markets in the united states and in three dozen countries around the world we arepart of the fabric of those communities where our  teammates live work and raise their families public companies that employ and invest at the scale thatwe and others do are wellpositioned to address income inequality clean energy health care and affordable housing through thought leadership investment innovation mobili zation of capital and in other ways privatesector leadership is necessary because solutions involving capitalism are inher ently sustainable and the returns will bring continued and increasing investment but as the great student of business and author jim collins has said we have to embrace the genius of the and we have to do our part to achieve strong and timely progress on the sustainable development goals and we have to deliver strong returns to you our shareholders as we do so this enables us to keep addressing these important priorities we are doing this and we are committed to doing more how does bank of america do this first we continue to align our expense base and our balance sheet to find every business opportunity to provide good returns and to make progress toward our goals we do this by financing new energy sources by financing affordable housing and by financing other types of development these financing opportunities provide a return for investors while making progress on the goals second we bring thought leadership to the discussion our research team has demonstrated that companies adhering to sound environment social and governance esg practices will avoid serious issues in fact their research shows that investors could have avoided almost all of the bankruptcies of the last several years by avoiding companies that do not have good metrics on esg increasingly investors are looking for that kind of adherence in making investment decisions this is driving more privatesector investment capital from institutional investors toward companies that are addressing these priorities we also see this in our wealth management businesses where we are meeting client demandsto construct portfolios focused on companies that meet standards consistent with progress toward the sustainable development goals the practice is growing by harnessing private capital in this manner the alignment we create can help fill the gap left by limitations in government and phil anthropic spending by bringing more resources capital and expense to the task in addition we can be a catalyst for others to act our expertise credibility and ability to assess the opportunities can help others who have the desire but may lack the expertise to deploy capital third we contribute in the ways we manage our own activities we are more than halfway through our year  billion environmental business initiative supporting clients and others who are helping create a sustainable energy future we also focus on our own sustainable facilities management and improved energy efficiency for instance we have set a goal to be carbon neutral by the end of  we also run your company to provide great opportunities for teammates we hire from a diverse range of locations and  customers come each day to talk with a relation ship or product specialist for the financial advice products and services they need in  we announced our plans to renovate our financial centers and upgrade our atms nationwide to better serve our clients expand our consumer and small business services into new markets and grow our presence in existing markets i provided an update last year including our intention to expand our financial center presence in nine new markets to offer retail banking lending small business and investment services today we cover more than  percent of the us population with our retail branch footprint with the sched uled investments we will cover more than  percent we continued to execute this plan in  we expanded our presence in  markets including our newest  denver minneapolis and indianapolis we also entered the pittsburgh market in  and will be opening our first financial center in salt lake city in early  in addition to opening  new financial centers last year we completed renovations on  others we are redesigning more than  financial centers by  to make it easier for clients to access our banking and investing professionals for advice on their life priorities and financial goals adding financial centers also helps drive local employment as we have added teammates across the new centers look for a more detailed discussion of our hightech hightouch capabilities with dean athanasia president of consumer and small business on page  of this report while our investments may be most apparent in the consumer and small business segment we are investing and innovating to better serve all of our clients we have extended our mobile consumer experience intoour commercial banking digital platform with capabili ties that enable treasurers of companies both large and small to transact with the same mobile convenience this innovation benefits the clients whom we assist with marketsrelated services and activities such as electronic trading algorithms analytical capabilities systems and data management and counterparty risk management and backgrounds and provide opportunities for teammates to pursue their own path and excel that kind of opportunity for success allows a teammate to join us for instance from a low or moderate income neighborhood as did more than percent of our consumer and small business external hires last year and move into future openings throughout our company based on their own merit and desire fourth our own esg work makes a direct impact the direct investments we make the volunteer efforts of our teammates our philanthropic worksall of this helps address the challenges while our own esg work through giving and volunteerism cannot solve the challenges as we have relayed we are proud of what our teammates directly do to help make progress on these priorities let me give some examples of the different types of activities set forth above bank of america committed more than  billion last year in lending investing and philanthropy to deploy capital toward the sdgs in fall  we createda special  million blended finance catalyst pool to encourage more compa nies to participate in addressing those priorities our blended finance initiative combines different sources of capital for a targeted objective in order to accom modate different risk tolerances and rates of return as this approach expands over time we can create the capacity to mobilize vast amounts of capital and achieve the scale necessary to fundamentally address global challenges driven by the force of privatesector capital returns in one of the first commitments of our catalyst pool we joined with two other financial services companies in our headquarter city of charlotte north carolina to extend more than  million to fund lowincome housing developments most of that amount will be lowinterest loans to private developers building incomerestricted housing we believe it is not only possible but it is the desired outcome for bank of america as a public company to simultaneously serve our clients deliver forour shareholders and address these local national and global social priorities delivering on both aspects of the and is the way to ensure that we can continue to channel the capital from others and from our company that is needed to fund societal needs we all have to provide great returns while delivering on the goals our teammates are called upon in every community where they live and work to lead efforts that promote economic and social development and i am proud of how they step in to help we welcome the continued interest of elected officials in these efforts and engage them across the cities towns and communities we serve our commitment is a core element of responsible gr,28.15,1.0
38,Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2000,it is with a great deal of pride and plea sure that i take this opportunity to tell you about the tremendous success our company achieved in the year  first our financial performance was superb setting a new standard in the history of chevron operationally our performance was much improved as we set several records for safety reliability and production we continued to build increased organizational capability in the key drivers of business success and we announced plans to merge with texaco to build a stronger company for the long term the most historic achievement of  was our net income of  billion by far the highest in the companys year his tory that performance benefited from sustained high prices for crude oil and natural gas combined with strong refining mar gins particularly in the united states underlying these results however was solid operating performance for example we increased our oil and gas production  percent from the year before thereby taking advantage of high prices improved reliability at our refineries resulted in higher pro duction of valueadded products improving our profits while meeting our customers needs when supplies were tight in every operation employees focused on improving safety and reliability while at the same time continuing their focus on reducing costs for example improved processes for global procurement of goods and services saved more than  million during  in oper ating expenses and capital expenditures the result of strong industry conditions and improved oper ating performance was a return on capital employed of  per cent excluding special items an achievement that ranked no among our industry peers worldwide while these were important accomplishments during  we also took several steps to strengthen the company for the long term by replacing more than  percent of the oil and gas we produced in  through new discoveries acquisitions and other additions  the eighth consecutive year the com pany has added more reserves than it has produced reducing our debt ratio to  percent the lowest since our  merger with gulf implementing a  billion capital and exploratory spend ing plan for  focused on our strategic priority to profitably grow our upstream exploration and production business repurchasing  billion of common shares through a stock buyback program strengthening our chemicals business by forming a world class joint venture with phillips petroleum company last year we set two challenging goals for the fiveyear pe riod from  through   to be no in total stockholder return stock price appreciation plus dividends relative to our peers and to achieve a minimum of  percent return on capital employed while continuing to grow the company we said that achieving our goals would require superior performance in four key areas  operational excellence cost reduc tion capital stewardship and profitable growth  and that build ing organizational capability in each would be critical to achieving our financial goals we call these priorities  plus  id liketo update you on our progress which has been very good to date in  and  we are focusing initially on building worldclass organizational capability in two of those areas  operational excellence and capital stewardship weve already achieved demonstrable progress in operational excellence which entails safe reliable efficient and environmen tally sound performance companywide for example in the up stream our oil production operations at the tengiz field in kazakhstan have attained  million hours without a losttime incident while also achieving new production records in the downstream refining and marketing our north american refin eries have had their best safety performance ever these and other accomplishments are detailed elsewhere in this annual report despite our progress it is essential that we continue to im prove in safety reliability efficiency and environmental performance we are building our capability through better work processes enhanced training and certification more rapid sharing of lessons learned and increased focus on recognition and accountability the other area for enhanced organizational capability is capi tal stewardship wisely investing our money  a key element for a company our size with a capital and exploratory budget of  bil lion weve been seeing improvements in capital efficiency as our decision and execution processes are more widely deployed and lessons learned are shared across the organization we are increasing our organizational skills by providing project teams with improved decisionmaking tools and by con tinuing a rigorous analysis of completed projects so that lessons learned can be incorporated into the decisions and execution of future projects for example in the international upstream these techniques have been applied in areas ranging from the north sea and angola to australia and canada  and they have led to important progress in shortening the time from discovery to first oil production in the design construction and startup of pro duction facilities and in overall project cost you can be proud of chevrons talented work force and the progress employees have made in these areas as well as their aspi rations to be worldclass in each as i write this letter in february were making excellent progress in our proposed merger with texaco chevrontexaco corporation will have toptier upstream positions with reserves of  billion barrels of oil equivalent production of  million barrels per day and excellent exploration opportunities an integrated worldwide refining and marketing business a global chemicals business and significant growth plat forms in natural gas and power industryleading skills in technology innovation the merger will bring together two leading energy compa nies to form a global enterprise that working from  billion in assets is highly competitive across all energy sectors is pro jected to achieve at least  billion in annual cost savings and is well positioned for growth in short everything weve learned since the merger announce ment in october has reinforced a positive outlook for the pro posed new company thats especially true in one very important way as the two companies begin to work together to make the merger a success were already seeing evidence of a shared vision and teamwork that are at the heart of any successful venture and we share common values including protecting the environment partnering with the communities where we operate and promot ing diversity and opportunity in our work force our strong base business our progress in developing a top notch organization and our proposed merger with texaco position us to prosper in a world where energy in all its forms is central to economic and social progress energy vital to economic growth concerns about global oil prices and availability as well as regional natural gas and electricity supply and prices have been very much in the news events of the past year have heightened the publics awareness of how much our wellbeing depends on sufficient supplies of affordable energy efficiently utilized energy is a key input to a healthy economy that is increas ingly global interdependent and dynamic  with enormous potential for improving the lives of people everywhere the united states has a special responsibility to support energy progress as the largest economy in the world inextrica bly linked to the global economy our nation should take a lead ership role in developing a longterm strategy to ensure that energy supplies are sufficient to support growth we at chevron are committed to doing our part to responsi bly develop energy supplies and services when we complete our proposed merger with texaco the new chevrontexaco corpora tion will be even better positioned to fulfill that role we will have the assets financial strength and people to make a difference chevron will be a vital partner in creating the energy that fuels progress by doing so we will serve our customers the com munities in which we operate and our stockholders im very positive about the outlook for our company and very proud of the commitment and performance of the many thousands of chevron people who have contributed to our success ,7.727,1.0
39,Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2001,last octobers creation of chevrontexaco corporation on time and as planned was a major achievement that were proud of the tragic events of september  however overshadowed the merger and tempered our sense of celebration the terrorist attacks were a reminder  a terrible one  of how interconnected the world has become this interdependence can and should be a force for positive change  all the more reason for those of us in the global energy industry to work with renewed intensity when we do a good job of providing communities around the world with the energy they need for economic growth and an improved quality of life we also create value for our stockholders the intent of uniting chevron and texaco is to better equip us to do that job we can already see an interlocking of strengths in the rapid integration of our busi nesses and increased scope of our operations we expect to be realizing  billion in annual synergies by the second quarter  and were raising our sights higher still now active in more than  countries and doing business on a much larger scale we intend to be a leader and innovator wherever we operate the true measure of success however is not whether we have grown bigger but whether we have become better and how that translates into improved results we are confident that we can achieve these results staying focused even as the nuts and bolts of the merger were being fitted some important achieve ments to further strengthen the company were being realized we replaced  percent of the oil and gas we produced in   through discov eries acquisitions and other additions that marked the ninth consecutive year the company has added more reserves than it has produced we successfully started up a number of oil and gas operations typhoon began operations in the deepwater gulf of mexico the hamaca oil field in venezuela is off to a good start as are north nemba right and a new phase of kuito both off shore angola in addition the malampaya gas project in the philippines began production collectively these projects will contribute an average of more than  net oilequivalent barrels a day in  many of our historically strong oilproducing regions continued to perform exceptionally well north sea production averaged more than  barrels of net oilequivalent a day and the shelf area of the gulf of mexico averaged more than  barrels per day we successfully began operations of the caspian pipeline connecting the huge tengiz oil field to the russian port city of novorossiysk earlier in the year we increased to  percent our interest in tengizchevroil our joint venture with the republic of kazakhstan us refining and marketing had outstanding earnings in  reflecting improved margins higher refinery utilization and improved product yield and reliability we have begun implementing a  billion capital and exploratory program for  this is lower than the combined companies  expenditures and represents a focus on highimpact longterm exploration and production growth projects the sale of texacos interests in the us refining and marketing joint ventures equilon and motiva was completed in february  with the company realizing  billion in cash our  operating earnings were a solid  billion onetime merger costs and spe cial items reduced net income to  billion special charges coupled with weak mar ket fundamentals at yearend led to a disappointing fourth quarter theres no reason however for a single quarters weak results to cloud our view going forward as with any temporary downturn we are staying focused on executing our plans to create value for our stockholders our main business objective is to be no among our peers in total stockholder return for the period  through  we were no for the twoyear period  through  and were moving aggressively to retain that position vision and values during the merger planning process one of the early tasks of the new leadership team was to agree on a vision our consensus was to aim high to be the global energy company most admired for its people partnership and performance we then developed a document built on our vision called the chevrontexaco wayit is a statement of who we are and what we believe it includes our performance goals our ambitions and how we plan to conduct business the chevrontexaco way empha sizes not only financial and operating results but our commitment to achieving them with integrity accountability and open and honest communications the first pillar of our vision is people the chevrontexaco work force is truly globaland diverse and that is an enormous strength together we have one of the best teams in t he business  not just because of our collective skills but because we place a pre mium on values every day in communities around the world we demonstrate that what counts is not just whether we get results but how we get them the first companywide communication effort following the merger was about the chevrontexaco way and the importance of our shared values by early  in hun dreds of meetings around the world we had brought together virtually all employees to discuss and understand them it has been thrilling to see what happens when you unite people with different busi ness cultural and geographic backgrounds the surfacing of new ideas the sharing of best practices and fresh perspectives a vitality even greater than i had imagined we are creating a new culture from the very best of chevron texaco and caltex the second pillar of our vision is partnership simply put we strive to be the partnerof choice the people of chevrontexaco have an unrivaled reputation for establishing productive partnerships with governments other companies and communities we have a proven ability to build lasting business relationships that reach deep into the communities where we work a commitment to partnership is embedded deeply in our culture dating back some years its exemplified in the earliest oil discoveries in saudi arabia and indonesia in the creation of caltex and more recently in our successful developments in kazakh stan and the greater caspian region the third pillar of our vision is performance sustained worldclass performance is a requirement to create superior value for our stockholders we call this ambition  we believe that chevrontexaco must be worldclass in four key areas operational excellence through safe reliable efficient and environmentally sound operations cost reduction by lowering unit costs through innovation and technology capital stewardship by investing in the best project opportunities and executing them successfully safer faster at lower cost profitable growth through leadership in developing new business opportunities in both existing and new markets success in these four key areas will be achieved by building worldclass organizational capability the plus  during the merger process we continued our focus on two key areas of  building organizational capability in operational excellence and capital stewardship hundreds of leaders have been and are being trained in the key elements of both and that effort is paying off last year was our best ever for safety we also achieved worldclass ranking in a benchmark study of the efficiency of our us refining systems capital spending and our energy efficiency has improved steadily we now use  per cent less energy per unit of output than we did a decade ago building capability is the key to sustained performance improvement  is our road map to get there prepared for the future sufficient energy supplies delivered in an environmentally sound manner will always be critical to economic growth and prosperity around the world we are committed to providing that energy and with our increased scale and scope are better able to fill that important role regardless of industry conditions i believe we have the strategic focus and the opportunities to be the top performer in the business my belief rests on our talented and dedicated work force and their disciplined approach to managing assets building a strong portfolio and expanding partnerships im excited about our future and grateful for the tremendous work of all chevrontexaco employees around the world their commitment effort and enthusiasm make it possible for our new company to move forward on a solid footing im confident that working together we will deliver superior sustained performance and meet the high expectations of our customers the communities in which we operate and you our stockholders ,3.288,0.0
40,Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2002,chevrontexaco ended its first year following the merger with many notable achievements but with a clear challenge to improve the companys financial performance net income for  was down more than  percent compared with the previous year likewise the value of our companys stock  as with that of others in the energy industry and the broader market  experienced a sharp downturn we are not satisfied with these results and we are working aggressively to achieve substantial and sustainable improvement in the performance of all our businesses as we improve we are building on a solid foundation including a strong balance sheet and excellent investment opportunities that the merger completed in late  provided today we have the size scope and financial capabilities to create greater value for our stockholders the merger also has enabled us to deliver major cost savings by the end of the first quarter of  the company will have achieved an annual synergy capture rate of  billion  far higher than the  billion we had estimated at the outset strategies for success our most immediate challenge is to improve the returns on our invested capital our strategies to accomplish this are focused on improving the performance of our existing assets developing new assets that can deliver superior returns and exiting those assets that do not offer the longterm potential to create value for you our stockholders in the upstream business we have leading posi tions in some of the most promising regions of the world including eurasia west africa latin america australia and the us deep water gulf of mexico we have a portfolio of major projects that will come onstream during the next five years contributing significantly to production and reserves we also intend to build a profitable global natural gas business based on our large developed and undevel oped gas positions in north america africa and australia in downstream operations we are focusing on improving the performance of our refining and marketing businesses by capitalizing on our larger scale to lower costs and competi tively leveraging our enhanced market and supply positions throughout our worldwide operations we continue to focus on building organizational capability in two areas that are critical to our success  capital stewardship and operational excellence in capital stewardship we have been working to improve decision quality and project execution and we are seeing measur able progress for example at  billion our  capital and exploratory budget is  per cent lower than the combined budget of the premerger companies yet it fully satisfies our strategic priorities we also are making strides in operational excel lence which means running our businesses safely reliably and efficiently  was the safest year ever for employees and contractors a notable achievement that occurred during a period of major transition at the same time our worldwide refinery utilization rate increased to  percent and we have set targets for increased reliability in all our businesses if you take only one message from this annual report it should be that chevrontexaco is indeed up to the challenge of improving its financial performance by aggressively imple menting our strategies we intend to deliver strong results and overcome the challenges that negatively affected our performance in  financial performance review weak global economies restrained demand for petroleum products and lower production all took a toll on  earnings for the year chevrontexaco reported net income of  bil lion compared with  billion in  the companys financial results were hurt by  billion of charges from special items about  billion of these charges were related to our  percent ownership of dynegy inc an energy trading company that saw a dramatic decline in its market value due to the near col lapse of the energy merchant sector exploration and production income of  bil lion was about  percent higher than in  reflecting lower asset writedowns which were offset partially by a decline in oilequivalent production and weaker us natural gas prices refining marketing and transportation posted a loss of nearly  million in  compared with income of  billion the previous year the poor  results reflected weak margins for refined products which early in the year fell to their lowest levels in more than a decade in chemicals the combined income of chevron oronite which produces additives for fuels and lubricants and our  percentowned chevron phillips chemical company llc was  mil lion compared with a  million loss the previous year although results improved the commodity chemicals industry continues to be affected by weak demand and excess manu facturing capacity a year of progress and positive change despite many challenges  was a year of progress and positive change perhaps the most important achievement was the success ful integration of the operations organizations and people of chevron and texaco through out our global enterprise we came together as a unified company with shared values and a common vision we also marked several other milestones during the year our exploration program benefited from the best technology processes and practices of the premerger companies some of our most notable successes were achieved in the deep waters of west africa and the us gulf of mexico including the usan and aparo dis coveries offshore nigeria the gabela and negage discoveries offshore angola and the tahiti and great white discoveries in the gulf of mexico for the th consecutive year we added more oilequivalent proved reserves than we pro duced through discoveries acquisitions and other additions we replaced  percent of our  production we added significant amounts of proved reserves to our natural gas resource base and made progress on several major projects for example chevrontexaco and five other par ticipants in australias north west shelf venture signed a conditional year contract with the peoples republic of china to supply up to  million metric tons a year of liquefied natural gas lng for the proposed guangdong lng project in southern china  in the caspian region we moved forward to improve both our production and trans portation systems our tengizchevroil tco partnership increased production for the ninth consecutive year also in the second half of the year tco was able to transport all its crude oil through the more costeffective caspian pipeline consortiums mile kilo meter pipeline to novorossiysk a russian port on the black sea in  we expect to com plete a second pipeline which will link our  percentowned karachaganak field to the caspian pipeline  the companys annual dividend payment increased for the th consecutive year reflect ing our commitment to provide a superior return on our stockholders investment up to the challenge i am proud of the progress we made in our first year as chevrontexaco as we look to the future we are facing the uncertainty of a struggling global economy yet there are extraordinary opportunities for a company with our capabilities chevrontexaco is a major player in the global energy industry and we are focused on our most important financial objective  to be no  among our largest global competitors in total stockholder return for the period  through  we have an active independent board of directors that brings a wealth of experience to this important role  including expertise in government education industrial manu facturing consumer products and high technology the integrity knowledge and perspectives of our board are invaluableto chevrontexaco as we make decisions that will enable us to achieve our ambitious goals our company values too are essential as we pursue our objectives in everything we do we are guided by our commitment to conduct our business in a responsible and ethical manner we respect the law support universal human rights protect the environment and benefit the communities in which we operate by holding firm to our values we are moving toward our vision of being the global energy company most admired for its people partner ship and performance it is no accident that people are listed first in our vision statement our diverse global work force is the most important factor in our success and i applaud the  employeesof chevrontexaco for their contributions itis through their work that the company is wel comed around the world and has become a partner of choice in some of the most impor tant projects in

kazakhstan nigeria and venezuela establishing a global natural gas business and achieving milestones in the commercialization of our vast australian and west african gas resources significantly improving performance in refining and marketing our strategies  stepping up the pace our global upstream strategy is to grow profitability in our core areas and build new legacy positions we are well positioned to do both our crude oil and natural gas production is located in large basins around the globe where we have existing infrastructure and are typically one of the top three producers we have a queue of projects that will add to production throughout the decade and beyond we hold exploratory acreage in some of the most promising regions of the world and we are confident we can build on an already successful exploratory program in  we established a business development group responsible for identifying and developing new largescale resource opportunities throughout the world our global natural gas strategy is to commercialize our large equity resource base by targeting the rapidly growing north american and asian markets in the atlantic basin we are pursuing several liquefied natural gas lng projects that would supply the first offshore lng regasification terminal in the united states in the pacific basin we are expanding our successful lng business in australia to supply markets in north america and asia we also are moving forward on a gastoliquids project in nigeria our global downstream strategy is to improve future returns by focusing on areas of market and supply

for delivery to north american and asian markets in downstream our strategic priority is to enhance returns by focusing on areas of market and supply strength oil demand has been stronger than predicted and spare capacity has been reduced with almost  percent of our production in crude oil we are well positioned to benefit from higher prices at the same time refining margins have been particularly strong in asia and the us west coast and sun belt where the company has a majority of its refining capacity strong focus execution growth while the industry benefited from high commodity prices this past year chevrontexacos per formance was enhanced by strong execution against its strategic objectives specific achievements included strong exploration results with potentially significant new crude oil and natural gas dis coveries in north america europe australia africa and latin america we also continued our portfolio rationalization through the sale of nonstrategic production assets at a time when we could take advantage of high market prices in  our downstream operations were aligned functionally across the globe this resulted in operating and efficiency gains

57,Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2000,halliburton initiated significant changes during  as we restructured the company to profit from growing opportunities in the worldwide energy industry these changes included the decision to divest the dresser equipment group and the formation of our energy services and engineering and construction groups halliburton also experienced a transition in senior management dick cheney retired as our chairman in august to run for vice president of the united states and i was elected chairman and chief executive officer in addition to my job as president dicks tenure was marked by a period of extraordinary growth for halliburton in five years halliburton has grown from a  billion company to its present  billion size at the same time we have become a more closely knit organization with a more focused and unified strategy were grateful for dicks service and commitment to halliburton and wish him well in his new role in public life in  the demand for energy services was particularly strong in the us as both crude oil and natural gas prices rose substantially and oil and gas companies increased their expenditures for exploration and production ep projects however historically twothirds of halliburtons energy services business comes from outside the us and demand for energy services in international areas has been slower to accelerate as exploration and development increases overseas in  we are in an excellent position to continue to grow our revenues and earnings in the upstream oil and gas sector overall oil and gas company ep spending was up by more than  percent in  early estimates for  are for additional spending growth of around  percent the demand for engineering  construction ec projects however did not mirror that for energy services in  higher prices for oil and gas had not yet translated to increased spending by our customers on e  c projects in the liquefied natural gas lng refining and petrochemical industries this lack of market opportunities along with a consolidating customer base and a fiercely competitive environment contributed to my decision to restructure the ec group this change will help us gain operating efficiencies and provide a stronger platform for consistent profitability with improved operating margins current and projected strength in the energy services markets in the us and overseas should be followed by increased spending in the ec sector we expect this to begin in late  and  halliburtons  revenues from continuing operations were  billion net income for the year including discontinued operations was  million and  million from continuing operations earnings per diluted share were  compared with  per share for  discontinued operations are those of the dresser equipment group which is in the process of being sold the energy services group includes our business units providing services and products to the upstream oil and gas business the groups  revenues were  billion compared to  billion in  while operating income more than doubled to  million in  compared to  million in  this dramatic improvement came from stronger demand for energy services in north america the ec groups revenues were  billion compared to  billion in  and operating income was  million compared to  million in  this decline was a reflection of the lack of new downstream projects and intense compe tition for the few available opportunities our third business segment dresser equipment group was reclassified as discontinued operations after we decided to sell the business the group is performing well but their lines of business do not closely fit our core business and our longterm goals and objectives this move will bring a sharper focus on our core business activities the estimated  billion net proceeds will be used for working capital and to repay debt which will leave us in an even stronger financial position to pursue strategic acquisitions and internal invest ment opportunities we expect a pretax profit of about  million from the sale and expect it to be completed in the sec ond quarter of  halliburton will retain a  percent equity stake the changes in our energy services and ec groups have been driven by the same strategic goals to improve the competitive position of our product lines to bring a new intensity and focus to our commitment to the energy industry and to improve profitability in the energy services group this means a renewed focus on optimizing the value of our individual product lines  turning their brand name capital and strong market position into higher profit margins this will be the focus of the energy services management in  at the same time in order to make our ec organization flatter and simpler i combined all our engineering and construction operations into one company all engineering construction fabrication and project management are now part of kellogg brown  root kbr the restructuring has achieved a reduction in the number of executives in the company and a flatter more responsive management structure in both business segments this organization will both strengthen our individual discrete product and service lines and at the same time give us a more effective framework for developing integrated technology products and for pursuing large integrated projects the most significant application for integrated technologies over the next several years is in deepwater exploration and production projects we estimate there will be about  billion committed annually to deepwater projects by  up from  billion in  winning these projects requires project management skills the ability to match the subsurface and surface work to perform and integrate services during the project and to develop new enabling technologies  all halliburton strengths and weve proven our ability to compete by winning the engineering procurement and construction epc contract for the  billion barracudacaratinga offshore project in brazil our organization and our technology strategy  the focus of this annual report  are designed to position halliburton to win large projects and continue our worldwide leadership in providing discrete energy services i would like to thank all of our employees who are executing the business strategies which will drive future success for the company and our shareholders ,0.501,1.0
58,Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2001,dear fellow shareholders employee motivation has a direct bearing on financial results with billion in revenue  was a good year for halliburton and id like to thank the management team and our highly motivated workforce for their contributions that help continue to position halliburton as one of the best most focused and innovative service companies in the world our energy services group ended  with record operating income while our engineering  construction group halliburton kbr exceeded its revenue and margin commitments and continues to be awarded quality jobs on terms that should enhance future returns on capital within the energy services group both landmark graphics and halliburton energy services had excellent results despite the decline in rig activity in the united states toward the end of the year both businesses benefited from their strong international presence and broad suite of products and services the pressures facing halliburtons customers are among our biggest challenges what drives the oil and gas industry is the same today as it will always be our customers have to find and replace the oil and gas they produce every year they have to do it from increasingly remote and hostile locations and they have to bring it to market at a cost thats commercially and politically acceptable the future performance of halliburton strongly depends on technology in  halliburton spent just under  million on technologies aimed at our existing businesses and product lines we plan to continue our technology spending at approximately this rate in  in addition we are prepared to make equity investments in technologies that are attractive in the marketplace to either expand our current portfolio or to create entirely new businesses this type of investment is not new to our company halliburton has spent almost  million on external technology over the past three years these types of opportunities do not come along every day continuing this pace of external investment depends on our ability to identify and acquire new technologies that will create value to our shareholders halliburtons technology investment will ensure that we increase production increase reserves decrease capital and operating costs reduce uncertainty and improve productivity for our customers the technology challenge for our industry is immense most of the promising reservoirs our customers pursue today are in deeper and deeper water today we are drilling wells more than  feet into the earth in over  feet of water developing oiland gas resources in deep water requires extraordinary technology as well as investing in deepwater and datamanagement technologies were strengthening our focus on real time reservoir solutionssm rtrs this means dramatically improving the speed and quality of decisions needed to develop the reservoir we do this by providing accurate instant information from wells and surfaceproduction systems teams observing the data use it to make timely reservoir management decisions during operations this is changing the way our customers manage production geology engineering and facilities design processes are becoming integrated customers will be able to manage their facilities their maintenance and their safety and environmental compliance from operational control centers specialists will be able to monitor and direct wellsite operations for multiple fields from a visualization room mounted on a single platform so halliburton is investing in the future we will have the substantial technological prowess needed for the industrys longerterm challengesfor several years the finding and development costs of the global energy industry were declining now theyre on the rise again our technology is changing the business processes in well construction well production and asset management within a short time we believe our technologies will help cut well construction costs by  percent also of fundamental importance to our prosperity is management of the halliburton brand if our brand is more trusted relied upon and stronger than the competitions we will generate superior results in the fourth quarter of  we launched a brand alignment and positioning program this followed a comprehensive globally researched brand identity program carried out to effectively position halliburton for the future despite the emotion felt in different parts of the organization this was an important evolution for the company the name halliburton is synonymous with quality trust integrity and technology the initiative enhances those qualities while respecting the rich heritage of our founding fathers erle p halliburton george and herman brown solomon dresser and morris w kellogg our success in business also requiresa commitment to social citizenship business ethics and corporate perspective this includes having respect for the environment concern for employee safety and welfare and giving back to the communities in which we work i cant overemphasize the importance of health safety  environment hseto our companys operations the health and safety of employees and thosewe work with is vital hse is one of our core values and it will never be sacrificed in the name of profits investing in the future means different things in different parts of the world in developing countries it may mean providing opportunities for training and employment or employees volunteering time to help build schools and hospitals it certainly includes a willingness to balance the demand for shortterm profits with the resources we need for success in the future as ceo of halliburton i believe one of my responsibilities is to set the tone for our companys commitment to the right social responsibility and to help us find a way to balance these obligations with the demands of our shareholders one of the most wonderful aspects of our company and one of our great challenges is our diversity with  employees working in about  locations in more than  countries when i walk the corridors of any halliburton facility i am pleased to see employees of every race culture and religion and hear the languages of almost every nation i also see the pride and the connection our employees have to their country to our company customers and partners the terrorist attacks on the united states in september  touched us all in different ways i am very proud of the way halliburton employees around the world rallied in support of the victims the impact of  on the corporate world has been huge in the short term but i believe longterm prospects for the worldwide economy remain bright particularly for our industry sectorthe halliburton stock price dropped precipitously toward the end of the year there were several reasons for the drop first there was overall uneasiness about the us and global economies and the negative impact on oil and gas prices and the tragic events of  heightened those concerns but the main reason was reaction to several sizable asbestos related jury verdicts against the company the lawsuits relate mainly to products manufactured by various divisions of dresser inc and past operations of brown  root the largest category of claims relates to harbisonwalker a refractory company that dresser spun off in  although weve worked hard to explain our strategy its likely that the investment community will continue to express concern about our asbestos related activities in the face of softening fundamentals in the oilfield services industry we take the issue very seriously and understand the concerns our shareholders have asbestos litigation is a us national problem  many companies are affected  and the civil justice system is producing uneven and inequitable results we believe asbestos litigation needs serious review by congress in the meantime the company has substantial insurance we continue to pursue what i believe is the right litigation strategy and we are conducting a vigorous defense of asbestos lawsuits while these issues have had a negative impact on our share price in the near term we will continue to work through this problem without losing sight of our strong global market position and our underlying corporate strategy we will continue to invest in the people equipment and technologies that we believe will make us successful our businesses are strong and healthy and our financial disclosure is accurate and complete while the global economic slowdown has hurt the demand for hydrocarbons the fundamental nature of our industry has not changed we are driven by supply and demand energy prices are cyclical our business is cyclical and we have to deal with the current downturn as best we can halliburton has a strong history of performance that helps us ride through weak periods we continue to introduce new technologies that will give us a competitive advantage even in the face of soft demand were always looking for innovative business relationships that will keep us working and keep our customers developing in spite of shortterm price fluctuations steering a course through price swings is one of the great management challenges in our business how well we succeed is an indicator of our overall management quality we can count on one thing our industry will always be affected by world events and economics none of our technologies will change that and none of them are shortterm solutions they require heavy investment and they demand that we change the way we think and work we must pursue the technologies that are best for our company and our industry tomorrow next year and for the next generation by most measures and certainlyin light of current industry conditions we have completed an excellent year the full years earnings from continuing operations exceed all prior years combined since the dresser mergerwe are very well positioned for through the cycle revenues and earningswith almost  billion in backlog and industryleading people technology products and services ,0.809,1.0
59,Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2002,dear fellow shareholders in  real time technology began transforming halliburton into a faster smarter more responsive service company this year we took the next step and made service quality a companywide campaign at halliburton weve always prided ourselves on our ability to perform under the most extreme conditions or constraints but with the economy laboring under the strain of geopolitical tensions and uncertainties the market place demands even more we believe that service quality or knowing what customers expect and delivering it right the first time will give us the edge companies that can consistently deliver exceptional service quality will win on every front  customer satisfaction employee motivation and shareholder value throughout these pages youre going to see and read stories of halliburton people achieving service quality beyond expectations youll see them on job sites in remote and demanding places in laboratories and manufactur ing facilities around the world youll meet teams individuals old hands and newcomers and what youre going to notice is how much pride they have in what they do they are excited about where they work and howhard they work theyre proud of their years of experience and their loyalty to the company they are halliburton and it is through their efforts and the efforts of thousands more like them that halliburton has achieved good financial performance in   even during a difficult environment looking back  gave rise to a new and frightening world with fear of terrorism the war in afghanistan a global recession and growing geopoliti cal instability that atmosphere has persisted making many companies hesitant to increase their investments because of concerns of what might happen in the future yet despite all this and the cloud of asbestos litiga tion  was a very good year for halliburton while revenues were down slightly for the year we are very pleased with our performance relative to our peers in this very difficult environment id like to thank the management team and hardworking halliburton people everywhere certainly one of the biggest news items for halliburton this year has been the progress we have made toward resolving our asbestos litigation problem we still have a long way to go and may not get there but we are working toward a resolution that we believe will result in a fair and equitable settlement with the asbestos claimants and free us to concentrate on the future overall we had solid results from the energy services group following a record year for the energy services group in  reduced drilling activity in the united states and canada and increased pricing pressures in  resulted in a  percent drop in revenues for the energy services group yet in spite of the decline in rig activity sperrysun had record revenues of  billion and landmark graphics again had excellent revenues and operating income increases higher revenues on the engineering  construction side of the business offset the energy services groups decreased revenues the engineering  construction groups onshore and offshore business revenues increased by  percent or more while the infrastructure business experienced a  percent rise with large contract wins in algeria egypt and nigeria kbr continues to perform extremely well in the liquefied natural gas lng market government services also experienced significant successes including a site support serv ices contract with the us department of energys los alamos national laboratory in new mexico and a designbuild contract for the new us embassy compound in kabul afghanistan a continuing bright spot for both business groups was the international market halliburtons international revenues increased in  to  percent of total revenues from  percenta year ago another positive wasthe dispositions of noncore business assets that bolstered our liquidity last year our message was of transformation the transformation continues sweeping through every part of the company there have been major organizational changes as the energy servicesgroup esg and engineering  construction group kbr became two independent business units in  there were many reasons for this restructuring liquidity pressures in a more difficult global business environment competitive pressures to have the best possible cost structure pressure on the stock price due to asbestos litigation and the increasingly different business drivers business cycles and customers of the energy services group and engineering  construction group but the overriding reason restructuring will enable both companies to strengthen their busi nesses and go headtohead with our most powerful competitors many of them companies that have an emphasis on one core competency this will in turn position halliburton to achieve sustained growth and profitability  there have been management changes edgar ortiz the chief executive officer of the esg retired dec  after a distinguished year career in the industry and halliburton energy services president john gibson succeeded him kbr continues under the leadership of randy harl doug foshee is now our chief operating officer and c christopher gaut has joined us as chief financial officer  there have been fundamental business changes with the engineering  construction group making a bold move in deciding it will no longer pursue lumpsum engineering procurement installation and com missioning epic projects for the offshore oil and gas industry until and unless the current business model improves to allow for reasonable profits at reasonable risks the oil and gas industry is historically boom or bust since the collapse in prices in late  oil prices have been even more unstable than in past decades the tight energy supplyanddemand balance in the industry these days means that even small shifts can lead to large swings in prices clearly we are at a point in time where we must redesign our company for short commodity price cycles and position ourselves technologically operationally and culturally to respond as the energy industry is evolving that means looking beyond what will make us successful this year and for ward into the next  years were working hard to increase our productivity so that we can accomplish more with a smaller core group programs that align employee perform ance and compensation with our busi ness objectives are an important first step our intense service quality focus will produce more efficiencies as well as a competitive advantage were also finding ways to work with our customers to improve overall efficiency this could mean a restruc turing of traditional relationships or it could mean collaborative relation ships yielding more focused effective products and services at halliburton different times call for fresh thinking innovation is the means by which companies exploit change as an oppor tunity for growth and technology will continue to be a major thrust of our strategy over the past five years halliburton has invested more than billion developing gamechanging technologies in almost every product line instead of designing products to compete headtohead with others in the market our aim is to create products that optimize assets solve problems and deliver longterm value for ourselves and our customers today at the esg new technology accounts for more than  percent of our total revenues but innovation can also be achieved by integrating existing technologies to provide new or improved offerings and we are pursuing opportuni ties to do this at the same time we are shifting our economic resources into areas of higher productivity and greater yields the energy services group and engineering  construction group currently hold the no  or no  positions in most of their product lines the energy services group derives more than  percent of its revenue today from product service lines where it holds a no  or no  position in the months ahead you will see us developing strategies and investing to sustain and grow those positions in all of our product lines because thats what will generate the profitability to sustain us boom or bust ive said before how important health safety and environment hse is to halliburton respect for the environment and for the health and safety of our employees and others that we work with is a core value and we are a leader in this arena hse is really about good business practices take for instance companymandated driver safety initiatives theres a clear correlation between not wearing seat belts and cell phone use while driving and the quantity and severity of incidentsthat impact the health and safety of our employees adverse incidents have a negative impact on insurance rates and worker productivity which increase our cost of operations a zero incidents objective is not just a good idea its good business protecting the environment as we go forward in the next decades is another good business practice  management of environmental risks saves money today and demonstrates our commitment to a better environment halliburton is developing new technologies that will help our customers address some of their most pressing environmental needs for instance halliburton developed the sea emerald burner for well testing which produces a  percent clean burn back in  its still considered the industry standard but as good as it is the result is still significant ther mal releases that are suspected to add to global warming now were working on technologies that will eliminate flaring altogether such as openhole test techniques formation testing while drilling and underbalanced drilling methods that enable us to evaluate the reservoir in real time while drilling all of these technologies are environ mentally responsible but none of them will be truly successful unless they are more costefficient and effective its entirely achievable too as we learned from developing our new accoladetm drilling fluid system designed to conform to stricter regulatory standards in the gulf of mexico accolade dramatically increased the rate of penetration over traditional fluids while significantly reducing fluid losses from as many as  barrels to a few hundred barrels its a great example of how creativity within guidelines resulted in cost and performance breakthroughs as we look into the future we can see that challenges abound in every area of our industry our industrys workforce in north america and europe is aging and few young people are entering the ranks but halliburton is finding and training talented young professionals at our locations around the world engineers from countries like malaysia angola russia and the caspian sea region are bringing fresh perspectives and drive they are welcome additions to the halliburton family the next  years will require diligence and imagination and despite current industry conditions i am very encour aged we are transforming our internal processes were improving our execution and our products everywhere you look the energy services group and engineering  construction group are being reenergized were evolving in our industry from having value in fixed assets to having value in intellectual capital which makes us very rich indeed because halliburton people are the finest that the industry has to offer as i walk the hallways and visit job sites the feeling i get from managers to field personnel is that we are entering the most exciting period in our history they are pleased to be here at this point in time with all its risks and opportunities because for the companies that can think clearly and act quickly the rewards will be great id like to thank the people of halliburton for their spirit dedication and sense of adventure im proud to work with you ,-0.998,0.0
60,Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2003,dear fellow shareholders halliburton was started in  in the oil fields of texas by one man with a homemade cement mixer and a borrowed pump today we are a world leader in oilfield services engineering and construction with over  employees and operations in more than  countries throughout the course of our history we have experienced great transitions and every kind of business cycle more times than we can count we have been here this long and come this far because of our ability to adapt to change that ability has been tested over the past few years but as i look back on our accomplishments in  im extremely proud and optimistic about the future we have made significant progress toward resolving our asbestos liability that has consumed so much of our resources despite some pretty big challenges including a sluggish us economy our energy services group esg and kbr our engineering and construction group have both had a successful year posting significantly improved revenues one day i believe we will look back on  as a watershed year when we took steps to become a leaner tougher organization and continued to put ourselves in position to win in the years ahead we reorganized the esg into four pl divisions addressing four core customer needs in addition four new regional and  subregional organizations have been established centered around natural geographic markets and aimed at further extending the esgs global growth for the first time we have broken out the esgs financials by divisions and regions to provide greater transparency to the financial community and this move is being hailed by many analysts as a model for the industry in three of the esgs divisions  fluids landmark and production optimization  the esg maintains a leading presence about  percent of its revenues are being generated from product lines where it holds a no  or no  market share one of our biggest success stories of  has been within the drilling and formation evaluation division with a product that holds the no  position in its market in last years annual report we introduced you to geopilot pointthebit rotary steerable technology the product was deployed in  and by  our market share went from  percent to  percent during  our market share jumped to  percent and is still growing we have also seen growth in our international revenues across all of our businesses there has been solid progress on the engineering construction and services side of halliburtons busi ness as well since kbr made the decision in  to no longer enter into undifferentiated offshore lumpsum turnkey engineering procurement installation and commissioning epic contracts we have continued to rebalance our portfolio by drawing upon kbrs centers of excellenceor core business strengths to grow the services and program management part of the business the strategy is already yielding significant contract wins including the kashagan oilfield development project management contract pmc for offshore and onshore kazakhstan and the reimbursable engineering procurement and construction management epcm contract for a major floating production offloading and storage vessel offshore angola kbr was also awarded the program management contract to restructure and modernize the uk national health services information technology systems most of the major international oil companies have targeted cleanburning natural gas as a key area of their growth strategies kbr continues to hold a leading market position in constructing plants for liquefied natural gas lng and is responsible for building  percent of the worlds lng capacity over the last  years as worldwide demand for lng continues to increase more than doubling current levels by  kbr will be right there developing new technology building on its knowhow and delivering the projects that customers need kbr also has much to be proud of for the workit is doing in support of various military troops in locations across the globe kbr was recently awarded a contract by the us army corps of engineers to support military operations federal agencies and governments throughout the us central commands country region that extends from the horn of africa to central asia as part of its competitively bid logistics civil augmentation program iii logcap iii contract with the us army kbr employees are providing the logistical support and infrastructure for army bases in iraq uzbekistan afghanistan kuwait djibouti jordan the republic of georgia and turkey kbr provides everything from food beds and mail service to laundry sanitation and utilities under a separate contract for the us army corps of engineers known as restore iraqi oil rio kbr with assistance from esg reservoir and data management experts has restored the countrys oil production to prewar levels working with the iraqi ministry of oil the work in southern iraq was competitivelybid and a new contract has been awarded for two years with three oneyear optional extensionswe will provide a range of services and support  from extinguishing oil well fires and providing environmental assessments and cleanup at oil sites to supplying design and construction of infrastructure and technical assistance as well as consulting services to the iraqi oil companies  that will help iraq build a sustainable future for its people were assisting iraqis in their daily lives too by importing and delivering massive amounts of fuel for driving cooking and heating these are tough demanding assignments in a dangerous region just  hours after the first troops entered iraq kbr followed with water and meals our people have been under fire and some have lost their lives to all of the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to get the job done i give my thanks and sincerest admiration what it takes to be successful in the st century is different than it was even a decade ago the continuing consolidation of the super majors the growing power of the national oil companies cost cutting issues and globalization are challenges that all of us face we are no longer accountable only to local or national interests we are a citizen of the world thats not a new concept for halliburton throughout our year history we have contributed to the economic development of communities around the planet by assisting in delivering oil and gas revenues to host governments building roads tracks tunnels and bridges for moving freight and providing local employment and trade our commitment to real time technology has createda new way of working that allows us to maximize limited resources  whether its hydrocarbon resources or human ones our commitment to service quality along with health safety and environment hse is elimi nating health safety and environmental incidentsat the job site as well as the waste of precious resources and capital the technologies weve devel oped are helping customers develop their assets in less time for lower costs and with fewer risks were participating with many of our customers and host governments to create global solutions to energy problems recently we posted a representative to a twoyear assignment with the world bank to work on the global gas flaring reduction team and to help it develop alternatives for harmful gas flaring practices encouraging the use of saved gas as a cheap and clean fuel for local communities since the earliest times a long and prosperous future has been the hope of almost everyone on this planet the secret of longevity is one of humankinds greatest quests building a sustainable future is a process that requires everyone in the organization working together to improve efficiencies it requires our will and the courage

61,Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2004,dear fellow shareholders for  years halliburton has weathered every sort of challenge to our company but i think we will remember  as the year we overcame extreme adversity unprecedented asbestos claims dangerous work with the armed forces in iraq public cynicism about large corporations a us vice president with past ties to our company  all of these issues converged in an election year as some tried to turn the proud old name halliburton into a political symbol today as we stand on the brink of a bright and exciting future i am proud to report that not only has halliburton survived some of the greatest challenges ever faced by any company but we have emerged stronger than ever look at our financial position our revenue and operating income increased in  and our stock climbed steadily through the year although the charges we took to resolve our asbestos liabilities the barracudacaratinga project and other outstanding issues in kbr depressed our bottomline financial results our liquidity remains strong and i believe that both the energy services group esg and kbr are positioned for profitability in  for any who doubted the strength and integrity of our company i think the continuing support of our shareholders and customers speaks for itself i want to thank you for standing behind us one of our most daunting tasks this year was concluding the largest and most complex prepackaged bankruptcy that has ever been accomplished resolving our asbestos and silica liability i deeply appreciate the members of our team who worked to achieve a fair solution for those who were impaired by asbestos exposure  a resolution that many said would never be possible the value of the settlement included a cash contribution of  billion to fund a trust for current claimantswe also issued  million shares of halliburton common stock for the benefit of future asbestos claimants this has been somewhat offset by insurance collections from more than  insurance companies which i view as a monumental achievement so far we have collected more than  billion from these companies and we expect to collect about  million more halliburton achieved another significant milestone in  when the barracuda floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel produced first oil in december barracudas sister ship caratinga also achieved first oil in february  our  billion contract  which included converting two oil tankers into fpso vessels and developing the well barracuda and caratinga oil fields in offshore brazil  was the largest engineering procurement installation and construction epic contract ever undertaken by a single contractor since then we have moved away from lump sum off shore contracts and have had good success with our new costreimbursable approach to this type of work the political rhetoric we faced in the united states has subsided since election day  but not without a price in the months leading up to the election the false misleading and unfair allegations about halliburton seemed to multiply exponentially simply because the nations vice president once held my job we worked tirelessly to address these relentless accusations to cooperate with every investigation and to challenge and correct misinformation now that we have overcome these difficulties it is time to look beyond  beyond asbestos beyond barracuda caratinga beyond the politics  to the immense potential of halliburton in  i look forward to spending my time on more constructive endeavors growing the busi ness and pursuing my vision for the companys future we have a worldclass leadership team in place to help us move forward upon the retirement of the former kbr chairman and the departure from the company of the esg president and ceo i eliminated those positions to create a flatter more streamlined reporting structure now the senior vice presidents of all kbr and esg operating segments will report directly to andrew lane whom i appointed chief operating officer i am profoundly grateful for our talented thoughtful and dedicated leadership team members who have supported me this year  andy cris gaut our chief financial officer and bert cornelison our general counsel in the coming year we will continue to review our full portfolio including the future of kbr the positive value potential that kbr brings has not been reflected in halliburtons stock price therefore we intend to separate kbr from the company this separation could take a number of forms including a spinoff or splitoff an initial public offering or the sale of kbr however i believe that in order to maximize kbrs value for our shareholders it may be necessary to establish a track record of positive earnings for several quarters and to resolve government investigations and outstanding disputes during that time we will investigate our options and determine the best value terms and structure for a transaction we have reorgan ized kbr into two segments energy  chemicals and government  infrastructure to support this effort halliburtons most remarkable asset now and alwaysis its people in  they had to defend their honorable work while their every action was examined as if they were under a magnifying glass yet even in the darkest moments their support never wavered i am proud of our employees their passionate commitment gritty determination and unswerving faith in our company have been my greatest source of pride and inspiration as i write this letter more than  kbr employees and contractors  the largest civilian force ever assembled  are working alongside us troops in iraq far from their homes and their families this is demanding dangerous work sixty of our employees and subcontractors have been killed  have been wounded and one is still missing as difficult as this is to accept it has been made even harder by those who seek to politicize the work of these brave men and women one of the brightest moments we shared this year happened when we welcomed tommy hamill home tommy was kidnapped when the truck convoy he commanded was ambushed by iraqi militants his courage in escaping his captors not once but twice exemplifies the can do attitude of the halliburton employees who have volunteered for these positions this ethic traces its origins back to our founders erle p halliburton and the brown brothers whose legendary determination to get the job done no matter what made them industry icons heartened by the amazing spirit of halliburton people we will honor our commitment to our customer the us government and continue supporting our troops its the right thing to do this year in our television commercials we told the public its not who we know its what we knowthe truth of this statement is evident in the many government and infrastructure contracts kbr won this year through competitive bidding  including two important construction contracts to support us navy facilities as well as a logistics support contract with the uk ministry of defence nobody is better than kbr at what we do worldwide kbr is wellpositioned to benefit from increased demand for unconventional sources of gas kbr has built a large portion of the worlds lng capacity and this year was part of a joint venture team that received the engineering procurement and construction contract to build another train for nigeria lng limited  the fourth this company has awarded us kbr is also part of a joint venture selected for design work on a grassroots lng facility in western australia in addition kbr is pioneering innovative gastoliquids gtl technology that will help the world bring its remote gas reser ves to market kbr is par t of a joint venture that was selected to provide front end engineering and design services for shells gtl project in qatar in the esg business is thriving we established annual records in revenue and operating income for three ofthe four esg segments in  and the total esg group posted record revenue in the fourth quarter i attribute this outstanding performance in revenue to our customers increased spending levels and also to improved pricing as capacity tightened operating margins benefited from the improved pricing as well but also from the esgs focus on capital discipline and improved cost structure we expect activity in the oil and gas industry to remain robust through  like kbr the esg has also enjoyed the staunch support of its customers during this difficult year one of our strengths is the ability to integrate our services across all product lines for an

62,Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2005,to our fellow shareholders we the members of the senior management team are very proud of the results halliburton delivered in  and we are equally excited about the prospects for  we anticipate continuing growth in oilfield services revenue and operating income as well as further quality additions to kbrs project backlog most of this report is devoted to bringing you the details of our financial performance but there is much more tothe halliburton story we also want to draw your attention to what drives the numbers  the organization the strategy and the people while strong demand for halliburtons services certainly played a role in our robust returns halliburton has also performed well relative to the competition the fundamental drivers to our success are our investment in technology equipment and people especially people a handful of senior managers in houston dont produce results like these it takes the combined creativity and expertise of more than  halliburton people worldwide our organization has transformed in recent years in order to be profitable at every division and to empower our people at all levels our  success and our bright prospects for  are in large measure the result of that transformation our company is organized into six divisions  four in the energy services group esg and two in kbr  each with a distinct mission and a unique business niche to provide a picture of the accomplishments challenges and personality of each division we have asked the division leaders to supplement this letter with their own reports their sections will give investors a new depth of understanding about halliburtons business and it will also provide a sense of the high quality of our management team halliburton has an exceptional global presence we have a strong oilfield services position in north america where our customers spending is most concentrated we also have a large presence outside north america which accounted for over  percent of the esg growth in revenue in  growing this international business is a strategic priority esg management focuses on working with customers around the world to ensure we have the appropriate infrastructure equipment and people to grow with their needs and to deliver superior performance worldwide for the year  esg posted revenue growth of  percent and operating income growth of  percent our operating margins were nearly  percent compared to  percent in  we believe esgs ability to sustain growth in revenue operating income and margin is indicated by our customers plans to increase spending on exploration and development and by their demonstrated confidence in the quality and value of our services continued demand growth for oilfield services should also allow for further price increases for our services in  in addition all four divisions are doing an excellent job of controlling costs in a growth market and we are increasing our capital budget for esg by nearly  percent to meet the anticipated growth in demand kbr delivered four profitable quarters in  posting  million in operating income the energy and chemicals division moved from executing the final stages of difficult legacy projects to newly awarded projects in liquefied natural gas lng liquefaction plants and the emerging gastoliquids market which we collectively refer to as gas monetization in  kbr won major gas monetization projects in angola australia indonesia nigeria qatar and yemen and we expect more awards for  these projects helped the division produce operating margins in excess of  percent an unprecedented figure the government and infrastructure division also posted operating income and margin gains as our work in the middle east received high grades from our customer reflecting the quality of our services we achieved several important goals that contributed to our strong performance working capital management and efficient deployment of our assets helped grow our overall return on capital employed to more than  percent in  we had also set a goal of achieving a debt to total capitalization ratio below  percent by mid as we had incurred significant debt in prior years to fund our asbestos and silica settlements we beat that deadline with a ratio of  percent at the end of  our strong cash flow will help us continue to grow through increased capital spending and acquisitions we also recently announced our intention to directly return more cash to our shareholders with a  percent increase in our quarterly dividend and through the introduction of a share repurchase program there are many more individuals who deserve recognition than there is space available to mention them here we want to emphasize the central point of this letter we are celebrating our most successful year ever because we have been able to empower the talents initiative and spirit of halliburton people from diverse backgrounds this has been the goal of our recruiting training and organizational structure we have invested heavily in our people and we will continue to do so one focus of our recruitment is nationalization  having a staff primarily from the region where they work our experience has shown the effectiveness of this approach in building longterm relationships with customers and communities a measure of success is the way our customers relate to frontline halliburton employees  the men and women who design the job deliver the services and create the value they are the frac crew working in the rockies the mud logger on a platform offshore west africa and the people providing hot meals and clean laundry to uniformed personnel in the middle east halliburtons frontline representatives have always been the source of our competitive advantage because they inspire confidence and trust from the people they serve thats why the sight of a red truck coming over the horizon is welcomed around the world and halliburton people have been good neighbors in the hundreds of communities where we live and work was a year of great challenges in disaster relief and our employees met those needs with their own initiative in country after country they volunteered their time to travel to areas in asia affected by the tsunami so they could help people there they also responded immediately after the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico with donations and services and when an earthquake struck pakistan halliburton employees from around the world pitched in to help provide relief we strive to be good stewards of halliburtons brand name and the financial capital that shareholders have placed with us and this report will show what we have done we are grateful for the confidence that our customers and investors have placed in halliburton and we look forward to reporting on a successful  next year ,2.358,1.0

economic uncertainty halliburton rose to the challenge and increased the strength of its global franchise in response to the global recession demand for oil and natural gas weakened reducing global drilling activity and causing customers to change their priorities north america experienced a shift in the resource mix for the first time the number of horizontal wells exceeded the number of vertical wells drilled as operators focused on unconventional basins such as tight natural gas and shale reservoirs operators have increased their production rates by leveraging fitforpurpose technology to drill longer horizontal laterals and increase stimulation intensity international drilling activity experienced an average  percent decline as the economic slowdown increased the amount of spare capacity discouraging investment in new upstream projects in contrast deepwater markets were resilient due to their larger scale and longterm capital commitments globally operators migrated from focusing on individual supplier costs toward reducing total project execution costs to achieve this objective customers purchased large packages of services spanning well construction and completion activities our broad portfolio of offerings and our ability to deliver integrated services make us uniquely qualified to meet this increased demand for comprehensive solutions a differentiated strategy while shortterm activity declined we continued our focus on positioning for growth and generating superior returns we maintained our investment in capital equipment and

67,Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2010,to our shareholders when we say that outstanding performance is a part of our dna at halliburton we have the results to stand behind that statement we uniquely delivered superior growth margins and shareholder returns compared to our primary competitors during  halliburton achieved revenue growth of  percent operating income expanded  percent over  and the company generated marketleading returns on capital employed of  percent this performance is notable in light of the moderated recovery of the broad economy from the recent global recession north america experienced a dramatic recovery in activity international markets commenced a gradual ascent as large customers rationalized spending and deferred project startups as we look toward the coming year we anticipate that our international markets will continue to repair led by the revival of offshore and deepwater activity we believe the industry is on the verge of another upcycle and halliburton is positioned with the right technology in the right markets to capitalize on this growth our  results reflect the successful execution of our strategy to utilize our broad global capabilities to enhance our market share position going forward we will focus on the worlds fastest growing oil service market segments including unconventional reservoirs deepwater and mature fields unconventional opportunity led by opportunities in oil and liquidsrich basins north america experi enced a resurgence of activity with a  percent increase in the united states land rig count oil and gas operators continued to explore and develop unconventional reservoirs in areas such as the haynesville bakken eagle ford and marcellus plays leading to a  percent increase in horizontal drilling activity yearoveryear the us domestic market experienced a structural shift away from natural gas activity and toward oildirected activity which increased  percent yearoveryear halliburton has become the leader in the development of unconventional reservoirs through the provision of its innovative proprietary technologies to the market along with improved process efficiencies and expert reservoir knowledge a superior delivery platform is another key element of the halliburton dna our ability to execute in these complex basins provides better economics for our customers by leveraging our reservoir knowledge we created lifeofthewell solutions to drive down drilling and completion times and to increase operational efficiency for example in the bakken play we were the leader in developing a hybrid completion solution combining conventional methods with slidingsleeve completion tools resulting in our ability to complete fracture stages  percent faster delivering this kind of innovation and efficiency is what sets our solutions apart our strategy in leading the north american unconventional market is to provide the services and technologies that allow us to deliver the lowest cost per unit of production for our customers with this in mind we are reinventing our service delivery model for well stimulation services we are developing technology to dramatically increase the reliability of our equipment and reduce maintenance costs in addition advances in modeling have united the pet rophysical domain and field operations making production enhancement at halliburton a multidisciplinary applied science that only a fully integrated company can deliver through the use of microseismic reservoir modeling and a proprietary complex fracture model we can assist our customers in delivering the most effective completions for a given well and also predict how to increase production from an entire field unconventional resources have changed the landscape of the north american market but going forward we see an even greater opportunity in the international unconventional markets only  percent of the worlds unconventional reserves are located in north america the remaining  percent of these resources lie in international markets china australia poland saudi arabia argentina colombia and russia are emerging unconventional markets that will become new frontiers for customers looking to build on their success in north america we are well positioned to support them in the development of their global assets deepwater innovation during the last two years  successful deepwater exploratory wells were drilled marking a significant expansion into new basins  many in areas where there had been limited previous exploration activity including ghana the philippines and mozambique as a result of these successes capital spending on deepwater projects is forecast to grow at approximately  percent over the next three years with projects expanding into relatively untapped markets such as australia southeast asia east africa the mediterranean and the black sea in all regions customers are drilling deeper and in more challenging environments which translates into growing levels of service intensity in the future deepwater wells will become significantly deeper with increased geologic complexity that requires more sophisticated and differentiated technology halliburton will play a valuable role in developing new technological innovations and best practices to help customers operate safely and efficiently in these challenging environments this year we commercialized several key innovations for the deepwater market landmark software and services released decisionspace desktop technology which is the nextgeneration software

estmztm enhanced singletrip multizone gravel pack system has no equal an extremely efficient sandcontrol solution for subsalt deepwater projects it can potentially decrease the time to complete a deepwater well by  days saving customers up to  million in rig time another industry first thats particularly relevant in highcost deepwater environments is the geotap ids sensor which enables customers to take fluid samples in real time during the drilling process to enhance reservoir characterization with significant time and cost savings impacting the decline curve the oil service industry has historically focused much of its energy on the front end of the exploration and production value chain including exploration appraisal and primary development with insufficient attention paid to assisting our customers in managing production declines in older fields we believe many older more mature fields offer economical opportunities for redevelopment the solution to impacting the decline curve depends on efficiency and economy customers will look to service providers that have the broad capabilities to deliver increased production from these fields  and that can add value to their asset portfolios there are currently  million producing wells on the planet with another  wells drilled every year the average well needs to be worked over every three to five years to maintain acceptable levels of production this creates significant opportunities for halliburton as many of these mature fields were devel oped with yesterdays technology today access to a greater amount of geological geophysical and production data combined with current technology enables us to significantly improve the overall economics of these fields stateowned and international oil companies alike

77,QUALCOMM,QCOM,Info Tech,2002,to our stockholders we are pleased with the substantial progress achieved this year in each of our businesses qualcomm has outperformed most communications technology companies largely because of the strong acceptance of cdma by cdma operators and their customers we continue to lead the industry in the devel opment and delivery of digital wireless solutions based on cdma including cdma and wcdma both based on the innovative technology we pioneered over a decade ago based on results to date for operators in south korea japan and north america thirdgeneration g features are proving very pop ular with customers and enterprises resulting in an increase in average revenue per user arpu cdma was first envisioned as a new way to make wireless voice calls more efficient and reliable it has rapidly evolved into a new way for people to learn play navigate and work users are finding that their alwayson wireless con nection to the internetsupporting a growing number of applications and content makes life safer and easier more productive and just plain fun qualcomm was firsttomarket with the best highspeed wireless data solutions for enabling these new services the third generation is here g cdma technology is now in commercial operation with  operators in  countries new systems are being installed in countries such as india and indonesia and existing systems are being upgraded from secondgeneration cdmaone to thirdgeneration cdma x and xevdo qualcomm has a highly focused business strategy that has enabled our company to strengthen its position in the marketplace this year even though the telecom sector continued to feel the impact of a struggling economy a key reason for this rapid acceptance is the economic benefit that cdma provides to wireless carriers they can upgrade their existing networks increasing voice and data capacity coverage and quality with moderate expen ditures for infrastructure equipment with chips and software supplied by qualcomm the upgrade for phones and infrastructure is relatively easy and lowcost and is backwardscompatible allowing subscribers to use both old and new phones and to roam seamlessly among cdma networks with our newest generation of chips and software roaming will be extended to most second and thirdgeneration networks including gsm new networks qualcomm has a highly focused business strategy that has enabled our company to strengthen its position in the marketplace this year even though the telecom sector continued to feel the impact of a struggling economy secondgeneration network rollouts were scaled back and subscriber growth slowed down as many operators found it difficult to raise the capital they needed to invest in new equipment for their networks this was in stark contrast to what is happening with qualcomm and cdma technology the primary cdma markets in south korea japan and the americas have per formed very well and we saw evidence of that this year with the launch of new networks and the introduction of many new phone models and other devices based on g cdma technology we also made substantial progress this year in cementing relationships that will ensure continued growth for our company in many key new markets including china india latin america throughout asia and hopefully soon in europe as part of our ongoing effort

84,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2001,a massive shift is under way in our industry you may think i mean the transition to a networked world after all ibm was one of the first to recognize this change and the impact it would have and make no mistake we are experiencing an explosion of technological innovation that will lead to permanent changes in business government education health care and every other area of human endeavor as every significant institution every product and service as well as billions of people become permanently connected but thats not the shift im talking about the revolution im describing is that customers are finally driving the direction of the information technology industry technologists talking to technologists the first  years of this industrys history consisted of the technology inventors inside it companies talking to the technology implementers inside businesses and institutions for most of that era the applications of the technology were fairly limited focused on the automation of backoffice processes like accounting and payroll or desktop applications such as word processing and email then starting in the early s businesspeople began to understand the importance of information technology to everything they wanted to do its gotten to the point where its almost impossible to distinguish between the business strategy and the it strategy of any successful enterprise approximately half of the investments that customers make in it are now driven by lineofbusiness managers not chief information officers this is a remarkable shift in just five or six years not that cios have become unimportant they now sit at the table where technology is translated into business value and their traditional bailiwick of infrastructure too has been transformed by the networked world but theres no question that business strategy now sets the technology agenda not the other way around prior to joining ibm my career as a management consultant and executive took me inside the inner workings of many industries so i was surprised on entering this one to learn that the computer industry had been able to get away with inventing new things and just throwing them over the wall leaving customers to figure out how to integrate and apply them that wasnt easy for those customers for a lot of reasons one was the absence of common standards the industry model was designed around a variety of proprietary architectures which to be candid technology providers were using to control customers this came as quite a shock to me since all my prior experience had taught me that you either give the customer what he or she wants or the customer walks well guess what customers have finally put on their walking shoes theyve made it emphatically clear to this industry that they will no longer cede control to the makers of the technology that means customers are demanding integration and refusing to accept piece parts that arent designed and delivered to work together it means they are demanding solutions not speeds and feeds and it means they insist that the technology adapt itself to the needs of their business and help them gain some tangible competitive advantageto squeeze cost from their supply chains to create lasting relationships with customers to empower their key constituencies internal and external with tools and knowledge a tale of two revolutions so the past decade hasnt seen just one major shift its seen two for ibm this was good news even in the depths of our decline in  it was obvious that no other company had both the technical expertise to win product battles against competitors and the business knowledge to become a trusted partner for its customers contrary to the conventional wisdom of pundits analysts the media and of course our rivals ibm still had a raison dtre of course we had to unlock both capabilities and in fact make them feed each other that goalcreating a business model that uniquely combines technical and business innovation a company with one foot in the lab and one in the boardroomunderpins the new ibm we set out to build thus the big decision we made early on to reverse the thencurrent plan to break up the company and commit instead to making all of ibms parts work togetherwas a fairly easy one it didnt involve a lot of research or market analysis the real question in my mind was not should ibm exist but rather can we become what this new era demands put another way could we aspire to lead again i cant think of many companies in any industry that have led two eras but i can tell you now that even in the dark days we began believing that we could defy history of course thats like deciding to climb mount everest you still have to climb the mountain! and we werent starting our trek from an elevated base camp or even from sea level this annual report captures a sense of the sheer range of what was involved to pull it off through it all our guiding light came down to two words customer focus it has proved both galvanizing and clarifying serving as the criterion for reexamining a whole lot of dogma and for resolving many of our seemingly intractable internal debates was it okay for ibm global services to recommend competitors hardware or software should the ibm software business develop solutions for sun or hp servers how about letting our hardware units support oracle or microsoft products in every case the answer was well do what customers want once we started really listening to customers its striking how many aspects of our business improved and not just on the marketfacing side but also in procurement with our suppliers and even in technology where the quality and quantity of our output have benefited enormously from exposure to the marketplace this is important the relationship between business and technology isnt oneway technology itself isnt some force of nature that we simply direct or use it too is the product of human intentionality and choice so yes we apply technology to solve customer problems and we also apply marketplace knowledge to help shape our research agendawhether its the direction of the economy or growth opportunities or emerging forms of governance and education or demographic and social trends or discoveries in other fields such as life sciences a decade ago the two were disconnectedand one of them was running amok technology was being pursued forits own sake and was either buried in labs in the case of ibm or generating premature visions of business triumph in the build it and they will come fantasies of the dotcom paper billionaires and new economy moguls we needed to reassert a proper balance and that led in ibm to a handful of strategic bets on the future drivers of our industry i would highlight four  the new industry model innovate or integrate to survive you have to do one or the other really well to lead you have to do both the vertical integration of the technology industry in the s and s had given way by the early s to a dizzying array of pure play companies specialists in pcs databases application software and the like this explosion of entrepreneurial and technical creativity was on the one hand a testament to our industrys enduring power its a well that will never run dry businesses however desperately needed someone to help them make sense of this chaos hence the emergence over the past several years of technology integrators and the rush of traditional professional services companies into ebusiness consulting as it moves out of the back office and into the executive suite value and growth in our industry are driven less than they used to be by technical innovation or product excellence as necessary as those remain what matters most today is the ability to integrate technology into the lifeblood of business the people who help customers apply technology to transform their businesses have increasing influence over everything from architecture and standards to hardware and software choices and partners  the new business model servicesled a lot of people now understand the lead role played by it services however building up the requisite skill base not to mention an appropriately sophisticated management system is nontrivial you cant buy your way into it or just go out and hire a lot of smart people you need a certain scale and range of disciplines also you cant just layer one kind of expertise on top of another this isnt just filling up two beakers one labeled customer and the other labeled technology it takes years and a lot of knowledge to be able to mix those elements properly plus services is rapidly expanding and evolving in some surprising ways it now encompasses not just laborintensive consulting but also the utilitylike delivery of computingfrom applications to processing to storage we see the beginnings of this trend in web hosting and our own ebusiness on demand offerings where customers dont buy computers but acquire computing services over the net on a payforuse basis to play here as well as in the globally booming strategic outsourcing arena you have to be willing and able to use your balance sheet to support growth ibm of course had deep experience in it services but in our old business model it was buried inside a revenue stream dependent on selling hardware we had to extract our service operations and turn them into a profit center in their own right that involved a lot of trial and error but today ibm global services has evolved into the worlds largest and most innovative consultancy systems integrator and strategic outsourcing leader  the new computing model infrastructure plus ubiquity it became clear to some of us in the mids that the pcdriven clientserver computing model had run its course and was being replaced by networkbased distributed computing this meant that on one end of the scale the workload was moving back to the infrastructure to industrialstrength servers storage databases and transactionmanagement systems on the client end it has spawned a proliferation of networkconnected devices of all kinds pdas cell phones videogame systems settop boxes and beyond to the whole pervasivecomputing world of embedded components in everything from household appliances to medical devices to cars and tying it all together was an emerging category of software with a wonderfully descriptive name which hardly anybody had heard of five years agomiddleware it stood to reason that in a distributed model profitability would be distributed too so we zeroed in on three sweet spots of the new computing stack enterprise systems integrating middleware and the specialized highvalue components such as custom chips that turn every sort of device into a computer this is anything but a portfolio approach were not just hedging our bets and were certainly not trying to be all things to all people our choices have been about both what businesses to pursue aggressively and what ones to exit such as enterprise application software and networking hardware  in enterprise systems we retooled our storage family and entirely revamped and consolidated our server lines and let the record note we didnt accept another piece of conventional wisdom we didnt give up on the mainframe like ibm its back transformed more powerful and doing quite nicely  in software through acquisition and internal development we built the biggest middleware business in the world thats fortunate because middlewarewhich helps customers integrate their applications and processes has emerged as the fastestgrowing sector of the software industry as a development platform its becoming more important than operating systems and that in turn has helped ibm software to become more deeply integrated into the wider software industry than ever before much better positioned to share in its future growth  in component technology what began as a search for a new revenue stream to support our rd expenses turned into a significant growth engine in its own rightour oem or original equipment manufacturer business yes that part of ibm has been hit by the general downturn in technology purchasing but we remain confident in the longterm future of the business which is based on exactly the kinds of specialized components for which demand will be greatest in a postpc world of course we are no longer alone in drawing this new computing model but while pretty much everyone now agrees on the outlines there is much disagreement about the approach basically it comes down to whether you believe in interoperability and common standards or not we have certainly placed our bet  the new marketplace model an open playing field a lot of companies  including many of our leading competitorsstill dont acknowledge or fully understand that common standards are essential in a networkedworld and that no one will ever again control customers through proprietary technology we can certainly appreciate their struggle weve had to turn a company that long ago made its fortune from proprietary technologies into one that saw the benefits of openness maybe its precisely because we were so acutely aware of the siren call of proprietary control that we have learned to resist it but one thing is apparent in a customerdriven world open architectures and common standards are inevitable today we are focusing all our technical expertise and marketing energy previously devoted to creating and marketing selfsufficient systemstoward reimagining and rebuilding them for open platforms we now share our emerging software products with the developer community license our technology and patents and champion common standards at all levels from linux to java to web services most important of all was the work we undertook to open up our technical architectures absolutely every piece of ibm hardware and software today is a fundamentally different beast and a more socialized one than it was ten years ago we know what its like to be on the wrong side of history the future wont be kind to those who ignore this lesson  put these models together and you see a changed competitive landscape with very new dynamics there will be a different lineup of winners and losers and at the head of the pack we will see the emergence of a new type of enterprise with a whole new type of corporate culture weve been building such a company for nearly a decade big but fast entrepreneurial and disciplined at once scientific and marketdriven able to create intellectual capital on a worldwide scale and to deliver it to a customer of one this new breed continually learns changes and renews itself it is tough and focusedbut open to new ideas it abhors bureaucracy dissembling and politicking it rewards results above all it covets talent and passion for everything it does its hard workthe hardest any business can undertake in my viewbut were making good progress from a changed approach to hiring and performancebased compensation to groundbreaking work on distance learning to providing the tools opportunities and flexibility for employees to control their own worklife balance we are creating not just the theory but also the practice and the mindsetof a true ebusiness this is a very different place from the one i joined nine years ago in many ways that are obvious even to the casual observerand in some that arent even to the observant insider it is smarter more unified and much much faster instead of consistently resisting change more ibmers now lead it our employee population is as skilled and comfortable collaborating onlineacross geographies functions roles as any ive seen and we are even learning to make a virtue of our size and complexity becoming more adept at working the matrix to get things done farewell nine years! as must be obvious by now i am not exactly ready for retirement and i would love nothing better than to help drive and learn from all that i see happening in the laboratories of ibm and the work were doing withcustomerseverything from smart dust to esourcing from global elearning to egovernment from life sciences to grid computing what a world is hurtling toward us! however a decade or so is long enough to be the leader of a large complex company like ibm to win in this industry youve got to get out in front of the big shifts that come along about every ten years you need fresh thinking and the courage to lead wrenching change with ebusiness we caught the wave early we bet the company on the networked world and that will serve ibm well for years but im sure that sam will face during his long and illustrious career another major shift when it comes i hope he throws out everything gerstner ever did adjusting to the markets evolution is why ibm is now succeeding  just as an inability to do so was once ibms fundamental failure we see fascinating hints already of the company ibm will become i am confident that with sam palmisanos leadership the best is yet to come as chairman of the board for the remainder of this year i will continue to be involved in any way that sam desires but my time as ibms leader is over it has been an enormously exhilarating run and i have learned more much more than i ever expected i dont comfortably express my deepest feelings in public so let me just say to all my colleagues all our loyal customers all our invaluable partners and to my friend and worthy successorthank you thanks to the ibm customers who rooted for us to come back from the brink thanks to our shareholders who took the time to understand what was happening in ibm against the backdrop of industry change thanks to a smart committed board of directors who provided wisdom guidance and support for an agenda full of risktaking change thanks to the many ibm executives who gave me a chance who helped me learn and supported me in the early days when they could very easily have been antibodies resisting this invader from outside and thanks  thanksto all my colleagues in this magnificent company no matter what the challenge from ibms own neardeath experience to yk to dotcom mania to recession to ibm employees blessed all of us with their grit their passion their compassion and their class im proud to have served and worked with all of you im grateful for all that youve taught me and for sharing with me the business opportunity of a lifetime and nowgo get em,7.723,0.0
85,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2002,dear ibm investor when i joined ibm it was one of the most respected innovative and successful companies in the world that was in large part because of the way tom watson sr ibms founder had shaped it he nurtured a unique culture a progressive set of values and the aspiration to make a difference in the world the companys position had been further enhanced in the s when tom watson jr took a daring betthecompany gamble on the system mainframe it revolutionized computing and transformed the way business was done it also spurred a radical reinvention of ibm and propelled the company to worldwide commercial leadership for two decadesof course you know that ibm stumbled badly in the early s largely because it strayed from its values and stopped listeningto customers and to its own smart people as a consequence the company failed to reinvent itself for new realities under lou gerstners leadership the people of ibm rebuilt their company it has come back a long way today as i reflect on my first year as chief executive i believe we stand our best chance in decades of returning ibm to a position of leadershipin all the ways that a business should lead i want to talk to you about that in this letter its important that you understand how we define leadership for ibm because it is the context for understanding what we accomplished in  and the framework for how we will manage ibm in the decade ahead seizing the moment theres no question that  tested our company we had to deal with a continuing tough economic climate particularly for the information technology industry which contracted for the second year in a row although our revenue from continuing operations of  billion was off  percent from  and our earnings decreased  percent to  billion all of our core businessesfrom servers to storage systems to middleware to servicesgained marketshare in  this is important it means we will emerge in an even stronger position relative to our competitors an environment like this for all its challenges is the ideal time to make decisive moves for future growth because of our ability to generate strong cash flows last year we invested  billion in research and development  billion in capital expenditures and  billion in acquisitions we took advantage of reasonable valuation levels and acquired several companies including pricewaterhousecoopers consulting and six strategic software firms early this year we acquired rational a leader in software development tools for  billion we opened the most advanced semiconductor development and manufacturing facility in the world and we also improved our competitiveness we revamped our pc and microelectronics businesses and both our personal systems and technology segments had returned to profitability by the fourth quarter our inventory levels now stand at a year low through progress on our integrated supply chain we took  billion in costs out of the business and we believe well achieve about the same this year one of the most important investments we made in  was to contribute just under  billion in cash and ibm stock to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation of our us pension planwhich was underfunded mainly due to low interest rates and continued weakness in capital markets after all of these investments we had sufficient cash to return to shareholders directly billion in dividend paymentsand indirectly billion in repurchased ibm common stock add it up and the people of ibm turned in a solid performance despite a most difficult year that performance was reflected in our market value while our stock price was down year to yearand no one is pleased about thatit held up better than those of all our principal competitors however the meaning of  goes beyond the blocking tackling and individual actions ive briefly described i believe that years from now we will see  as the year we fundamentally repositioned ibm for leadershipleadership in an industry that will be very different when it comes out of the current economic slump a new game for information technology in some ways the it industry will remain familiar it will still thrive on fundamental technology innovationan area of unparalleled strength for your company in  ibm scientists and engineers scored their tenth straight year as the worlds most prolific inventors earning  us patents nearly double the number of the next closest company over the past decade the us patent office has issued ibm  patentsmore than for ten of our top us competitors combined but in other profound ways the industry will be very different how most people dont realize it but the it industry has always been two interrelated industries one of course is computing this is more than the chips databases operating systems application software and other technology elements that are in a constant state of change this is about computing as an architecture a model a systemwhat all of those individual pieces when put together make possible the computing model doesnt change very often but its changing now the other industry is the application of computing to improve or transform some aspect of business and by business i mean the work of every kind of enterprise and institution this wasnt visible for many years because these serviceshelping customers apply and manage the technologywere bundled with the hardware or software but it was there all the same and hugely important for example although ibm pioneered the mainframe model of computing it would not have taken the market by storm if we had only brought customers a new machine we had to bring them a new idea about business and we had to show them how to apply mainframe systems to transform backoffice functions like accounting payroll and inventory management i dont think its an overstatement to say that ibm has been unique in stepping to the forefront of both these capabilitiescomputing and its application to businessfor most of its history today once again both are changing in significant and interconnected ways consider whats happening in computing our customers have stopped thinking of their technology needs just in terms of data centers or storage systems or pcs or even the network today its the entire technical infrastructure on which their businesses run a vital infrastructure that must connect with and support relationships and transactions with other businesses devices of all kinds and all the people using those devices my point is if customers are going to look to you as the leader in computing you have to be able to drive forward the entire computing agenda not just a piece of it we see a parallel situation in how computing is being applied by customers for the most part businesses and institutions have automated and digitized their standalone operations and processesthe back office the manufacturing floor procurement logistics customerfacing systems theyve extracted great efficiencies by doing so now they want to transform processes that cut across all of those systems why because they want to build a business that can respond dynamically to whatever the world throws at it and goodness knows the world has been doing a lot of throwing lately a new game for business all of this is what we mean by ebusiness on demand which you will be hearing a lot about in the months and years to come the promise of on demand is that a company or institution can provide products services information health care education government services and so onall on demand for customers citizens patients and students these senseandrespond or realtime enterprises enjoy enormous competitive advantages they are able to convert fixed costs into variable costs they can greatly reduce inventories and most compellingly they are extremely responsive to the needs of their customers employees and partners that is obviously very appealing especially in times like these however consider the magnitude of the business transformation it requires its almost as if a business were turned on its side moving from a collection of vertical silos to a seamlessly integrated horizontal flow across value chains thats a major major shiftin business design and in management thinkingand pulling it off requires deep business expertise and knowhow this may sound rather grandiose to some and of course all technology companies envision ways in which their products will change business and society most do so with great bravado more often than not though they are just plain wrong the dotcom era was just the latest reminder that creators of databases pcs and printers have no special qualifications to understand the future of serious business in fact they are probably the last people customers should look to for this kind of insight to be honest when we at ibm began to understand the future course of technology and its sweeping implications for business we looked in the mirror and saw some serious deficiencies in our own company true we had in recent years built up quite a bit of consulting capability but we lacked a critical mass of business expertise to help our customers become on demand enterprises it was this realization that drove us to acquire pwc consulting we now have nearly  professionals in industries ranging from financial services to health care with business process expertise in areas like supply chain customer relationship management human capital solutions and business transformation outsourcing we considered forming a web of alliances to gain the business insight we lacked others have chosen this path and its a perfectly respectable strategybut not for us ibms brand and business model are very different from those of our competitors fundamental to our identity as a corporation is this fusion of business insight and technology leadership our learning in each realm informs what we do in the other so we need an intimate linkage between them leadership on demand we have mobilized the entire ibm company and our expanding network of partners to make our ebusiness on demand strategy a reality that work comes down to three main thrusts  helping our customers become on demand businesses through ibm global services we are applying ibms considerable business process and industry expertise to help customers build businesses that are almost intuitive in their responsiveness to changes in demand supply pricing labor capital markets and customer needs this requires a great deal of integrationof business processes and operations and of applications and the underlying it systems it means making them resilient in the face of changes and threats from hackers to hurricanes and it means helping them focus on what differentiates them on their core competenciesand outsource or tightly integrate with strategic partners to supply the rest  evolving the computing model to an on demand operating environment on demand business creates new rules for it infrastructure computing must be integrated and must support integration of business processes and operations which is why our websphere software is growing so rapidly computing must be built on open technical standards and platforms which is why ibm will continue to be a leader of the open standards movementa leader in linux web services and other emerging technical standards applications must be developed for this new open model which is why we acquired rational it gives software developers a compelling alternative to proprietary approaches in addition an emerging technology called grid computing built around another set of open specifications allows the sharing and managing of separate computing resources as if they were one huge virtual computer this will dramatically increase utilization rates and give customers access to enormous computing capacity finally ibm technologists are also pioneering ways to make it systems autonomicmore selfmanaging and selfhealing this too is critical as the increasing complexity of systems is making them unrealistically costly to manage and maintain  establishing utility computingcomputing on demandas a viable and attractive alternative for accessing and paying for it this effort has gotten a lot of attention yes we intend to be a leader in utility computing services so that customers can acquire computing and applications and pay only for what they use ibm global services is already pioneering such servicesserver and storage capacity as well as business processes like procurement and claims processingfor companies such as american express the dow chemical company and mobil travel guide but we also want to equip and help customers to build their own internal utilities software to manage and balance workloads and server and storage systems to provide additional capacity on demand clearly the bet were placing on ebusiness on demand is a big one and part of what makes it big is that it encompasses where both computing and business are headed driving both at the same time requires a lot of work but its necessary if you aspire to lead this industry ibms center of gravity throughout ibms history we have reinvented ourselves over and over again the most visible manifestation of this has been how radically our product line has changed over timefrom clocks and scales to tabulating machines to mainframes to selectric typewriters to everything we do today how were we able to make those transitions without having a jarring identity crisis its because we never defined ourselves as a clock and scale company or a mainframe company or a typewriter maker even when we were the undisputed leader in those markets we simply committed ourselves to being the leader in inventing stateoftheart technology and helping customers apply it to solve their problems when technology and the nature of customer problems changewe do too as i said earlier the one time we forgot that and held on too long to products and ideas that were giving way to new ones we nearly lost the whole ball game thats a lesson we will not forget today with ebusiness on demand we are again redefining the value we bring to customers its driving us to grow certain businesses aggressivelyespecially services and softwareand to deemphasize others as we did in  i have no doubt whatsoever that  or  years from now we will be in a bunch of new and different businesses because technology and customer problems will have marched on hopefully with our company at the forefront but we will still be ibm the purpose of a business as you might guess by now we have been doing a lot of thinking about what leadership means for ibm to lead our industry we must be the company to which our customers look to understand the future of it and how it can help them create business value but there are additional aspects of leadership that are also important aspirations for our company as an investment as an employer as a member of the community now companies often say that being a great employer or a responsible citizen is as important to them as creating shareholder value or delighting customers or beating competitors but they dont elevate them as business priorities to be managed with the same kind of investment and discipline and competitive passionthat they apply to managing rd manufacturing and sales we do why because over time failure to understand change in these realms can be as damaging as failure to stay abreast of markets or technology maybe more so what do investors value what will attract and motivate the best workforce in the world what do communitiesnations and neighborsexpect of companies as with technology and customer requirements these are all moving targets we believe investors particularly those who invest in the technology sector reward companies that adapt that continually create and lead the highvalue spacesbecause thats the only way to deliver consistent longterm earnings growth in an industry that is constantly evolving we believe investors reward companies that manage for the long haul run highly efficient operations and are managed by experienced and disciplined leaders and at a time when industry growth projections are highly unreliable investors reward companies that outperform their competitorsno matter the rate at which the industry is growing or contracting this is why we have made marketshare a top priority i joined a company that was the place to work it was progressive fair and principled and it invested in its people and their development all of that stemmed from the commitment to have the best talent in the world a commitment we reaffirm today how you achieve that with programs and benefits depends on the times as the composition of the workforce and their expectations changed so did ibm often far ahead of other companies or government mandates we know that employees today value flexibility and mobility yet they want to feel part of a team a community of colleagues they value skill enhancement but they want lifelong learning not just classroom training most of all while they are attracted to ibms breadth and global presence they dont want to get lost in a big company they want to make a difference have impact all of this represents opportunities for us once again to innovate as an employer finally we need to adapt if we aspire to be a respected and engaged participant in our communities this is more far more than philanthropy although ibm takes a back seat to no one in contributions and volunteerism ibmers volunteered four million hours last year its about building relationships based on respect trust and integrityibms bedrock values and its about using our remarkable scientific managerial and analytic assetssome of the best minds on the planetto help local national and international communities solve problems and stimulate economic growth right now we have as many questions as answers and more a sense of where we must go as a company than a clear path to get there yet we believe these are all appropriate and worthy aspirations for ibm and ibmers they are consistent with the kind of company we want to be and have been for most of our history this is ibms dna the challenge of course is to bring the best of that forward without for a moment taking our eye off the customer marketplace execution and strong results in the end this goal of leadership broadly defined is what makes our company unique its why people come to work at ibmand why millions more have wanted to be associated with it there are certainly many places where a person can earn a very good living and build a highly gratifying career you come to a big complex company like ours if you want to be part of something whose impact is larger and you come to this particular enterprise to be part of something whose impact will last a company that explores a company that matters that was the company i joined  years ago yes the world has changed and theres no going back but my  colleagues welcome the challenge we are determined to make ibm a truly great companya great partner investment and employerfor our generation and for our times,3.579,0.0
86,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2003,dear ibm investor last year i told you that we were repositioning ibm for leadership in all the ways that a business can lead i described how ibm defines leadership along with our plans to achieve it and i said that i believed the results of this repositioning would roll out in meaningful ways in the years and decades to come twelve months later its clear that the future we envisioned is arriving and more rapidly than we expected this is in part because of the hopeful signs were seeing of economic recovery with the promise of renewed business investment in information technology its partly because of the rapid adoption of our on demand strategy by clients partners and the overall it industry but its also something moresomething specific to this company and its people and something longer lasting than a particular economic cycle ibm today is a very different enterprise than it was just a few years ago our business model has been quietly but substantially reshaped to capitalize on the most promising growth and profit opportunities in the market even more important for the long term our operations and culture are being transformed as well we are now focused with an intensity and unity i havent seen since the heyday of the mainframe as a result we are poised to take ibm to the next level and to redraw and extend the boundaries of the it industry a very good year for a very different company ibms  is the kind of year on which its gratifying to look backboth for our overall achievements and for the strong momentum with which we ended the year our revenue from continuing operations at  billion a company record increased by  percent earnings from continuing operations were  billion compared to  billion in  which included  billion of aftertax charges for second and fourth quarter  actions we continued to gain market share across all our core businesses ibm today is the market leader in servers middleware business transformation services and strategic outsourcing highlights for the year included revenue growth in every server segment a websphere middleware platform that grew  percent and gained market share and  percent growth in strategic outsourcing our success with clients was evident in fasterthanmarket growth for five of ibms six industry sectors for example in the public sector which includes our relationships with governments and health care providers we grew by  percent in communications by  percent in industrial by  percent and in financial services by  percent we again generated excellent cash flows after investing  billion in rd we had  billion in cash available for investment and distribution to shareholders we invested  billion of that in net capital expenditures and  billion in acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio and we were able to return  billion to investors billion through share repurchase and  billion through dividendsending the year in a strong cash position with  billion including marketable securities overall despite facing serious challenges the ibm team executed with discipline and indications for the year ahead are encouraging including a strong demand pipeline enlarged by more than  billion of services signings in the fourth quarter and a growing number of alliances with business partners and software companies committed to leading with ibms open standardsbased platforms all in all a very good performance but is it sustainable can we in fact improve upon it and keep growing for the foreseeable future i believe so and let me tell you why recommitting to high value for the past couple of decades if you were to look at ibms performance in any given year or over several years what would you see youd see a very large global company in which some businesses are growing rapidly some are flat and some are declining add it up and it would average out to steady profitabilitybut perhaps uninspiring growth for people with comparatively short memories this might be the only ibm theyd ever known and it would be legitimate to ask if the company is capable of more the answer is we certainly are in fact over most of our nearly year history ibm was consistently a company that outperformed others in our markets and generated superior returns and that was because we were singularly focused on leading and most often creating and defining the highvalue spaces in our industry of course with a company of ibms breadth and global presence there are always ups and downs that result from economic cycles product and technology transitions and sometimes issues of execution but its also apparent that somewhere along the line we became more focused on defending our existing leadership position than on creating the next one we werent particularly bold or imaginative in getting into new markets or developing new businesses products and services even when our strategic analyses indicated that something new was coming and just as important we hesitated to reinvent or get out of businesses that no longer represented high value for either clients or shareholders in a word we lost sight of ibms mission of what had always set us apart well weve regained our focus now ibm is an innovatorin every dimension of that word we know that ibm and ibmers are at their best when they create value that our clients cannot get from anyone else that means we will provide leadingedge technology services expertise and intellectual capital and will integrate these capabilities for each client to provide them with competitive advantage we commit to that we commit to innovating to deliver client success and that is something for which clients are willing to pay a premium this may seem like a truism but it actually commits us to a very focused strategy based on a choice between the two primary sources of growth and profit in it today the highvolume undifferentiated product play and the highvalue innovation and integration play focused on the enterprise it is this highvalue space we have chosen to lead we believe this is the right choice for ibm and our investors by focusing on this space we believe we can on a sustainable longterm basis generate superior returns compared to the overall it industry command leading share position in our selected businesses outperform the average of the sp  on return on invested capital and produce strong cash flows in recent years weve taken many steps to seize this position before i talk about those steps i want to spend a minute on what constitutes high value for clients today and what will do so for the foreseeable future its embodied in what we call the on demand enterprise and that in turn is all about a new kind of integration the next wave of integration after two decades of disaggregation the it industry is reintegrating this is being driven simultaneously by a major shift in client demand and a major shift in technology companies have come to realize that if theyre going to respond rapidly and effectively to todays volatile marketplace they need to do more than webenable discrete systems processes or business units they need to pull together all of the systems theyve already got and integrate them securely with their core business activitieshorizontally across not just their whole company but their entire value chain from customers to suppliers this is an on demand enterprisebecoming one is dauntingly hard to pull off it requires both the endtoend integration of the technologywhich niche product vendors simply cannot doand the integration of technology with business processes this in turn requires deep business knowledge and industry expertise that few traditional technology companies have and significant technical knowledge and research strengths that few consulting firms possess integration is also an emerging force in core technology and computing architectures to cite one example advances in semiconductor devices have been largely propelled by increasing the clock speed of the microprocessor chip this is like revving up the rpm of a car engine but while advances in raw speed are continuing apace they are no longer enough to increase chip and overall system performance for one thing chips have become so densely packed with transistors that they produce more heat than can be costeffectively dissipated the solution is integrationputting multiple often lessthantopspeed processors on the same chip along with additional functions like fast memory and highperformance inputoutput this is the approach ibm engineers have taken in developing our blue gene supercomputer integration of this sophistication is beyond the reach of most chip and systems companies it requires expertise not just in semiconductors but in advanced systems architecture custom logic design operating systems and software tools this is the kind of expertise that ibm has built up over decades and it is not easily replicated and thats why technology leaders like sony cisco apple and qualcomm have partnered with ibm for advanced technologyand why last year microsoft licensed ibms microprocessor technology for use in its nextgeneration xbox game console bulking up in on demand many it companies will struggle with this world that is dawningwith the need to choose between open and proprietary between serving consumers and enterprises between redistributing other peoples intellectual capital and innovating this is not about making pronouncements or promises a company cannot be all things to every client every partner and every investor for our part weve decided the two parallel trajectories of integrationin client demand and in what the technology requiresplay directly to ibms historic strengths however even with everything ibm brought to this table we needed more thats why weve made acquisitions such as pricewaterhousecoopers consulting pwcc rational software and  other companies in the past two years and its why we reset our priorities in rd to develop more technologies and services specifically for client needs in the on demand era on demand integration is also why weve placed a huge bet on standards from the internet protocols and linux to grid computing and web services without open technical interfaces and agreedupon standards even integration within a single enterprise would remain a gargantuan task and forget about integration with the other companies business processes applications pervasive computing devices laws regulations customs and cultures that make up the evermoreglobal marketplace of the st century an it companys position on open standardsnot just its rhetoric but its actionsis a clear indicator of whether it faces forward or backward is serving the needs of clients or protecting its market position in addition to the opportunities ive described our move into on demand has opened up some very large businesses beyond the frontiers of the traditional it industryopportunities that remain out of reach for most of our competitors one promising example is business transformation outsourcing bto which was not even part of the industry lexicon  months ago in bto engagements ibm becomes responsible for transformingand actually providinga clients business process in areas such as human resources procurement customer care and finance and administration thanks to the acquisition of pwcc and the formation of ibm business consulting services we generated nearly  billion in bto signings during the fourth quarter of  alone to give a rough idea of the potential here the current size of businesses outsourced spending on sales marketing logistics finance hr and all other administrative processes is about  trillion a year of that there is an opportunity in excess of oo billion in the bto areas we are pursuing we are committed to extend our leadership position in bto in remaking ibm to some people it may seem bold to have made all these moves during the worst market ever seen in the it industry but i dont believe it was particularly risky because it was driven by client demand and the realities of the technology whats really important for you to understand is that our commitment to leadership in the highvalue spaces and in innovation isnt a mission statement its a business model and it commits us to continual reinvention of ibm itself over the past several years weve taken aggressive steps to remix our business so that we are positioned for longterm leadership and new opportunities in the highvalue enterprise space however that changes we have since   exited or reduced our presence in such areas as application software harddisk drives networking hardware lowend printers and retail pcswhich we estimate have declined from  percent to  percent of it industry revenue  entered or increased our presence in distributed middleware nonhardware maintenance services intelbased servers and mobile pcswhich have grown from  percent of industry revenue to  percent and are expected to continue outperforming the overall it market  increased our revenue in business and technology consulting services infrastructure services and infrastructure softwarewhich generate superior longterm revenue growth profit cash and return on invested capitalfrom  percent to  percent of our total with expectations of increasing that going forward  grown aggressively in emerging markets in china india russia and brazil we generated revenue of  billion last year and saw doubledigit growth  upped our rate of new account growth giving us a total of  large medium and small enterprise clientswith ibms smallandmedium business segment alone growing  percent to outperform the market in  adding  billion in revenue and  incubated successful new highgrowth businesses such as life sciences digital media application management services ebusiness hosting services linux and pervasive computingeach of which has already become a  billionplus revenue stream in the areas were targeting within life sciences and digital media alone thirdparty analysts see more than  billion of market opportunity by  while we do all this were continuing relentlessly to improve execution by becoming an on demand business ourselves weve made big strides in product cycle time new product introduction sales productivity and simplification of our processes our inventories are at their lowest level in more than  years and our continuing progress in integrating our supply chain took  billion of cost out of the business in  surpassing what we achieved in  business value and a companys values as i mentioned last year weve been spending a great deal of time thinking debating and determining the fundamentals of this company it has been important to do so when ibmers have been crystal clear and united about our strategies and purpose its amazing what weve been able to create and accomplish when weve been uncertain conflicted or hesitant weve squandered opportunities and even made blunders that would have sunk smaller companies it may not surprise you then that last year we examined ibms core values for the first time since the companys founding in this time of great change we needed to affirm ibms reason for being what sets the company apart and what should drive our actions as individual ibmers importantly we needed to find a way to engage everyone in the company and get them to speak up on these important issues given the realities of a smart global independentminded stcentury workforce like ours i dont believe something as vital and personal as values could be dictated from the top so for  hours last summer we invited all  ibmers around the world to engage in an open values jam on our global intranet ibmers by the tens of thousands weighed in they were thoughtful and passionate about the company they want to be a part of they were also brutally honest some of what they wrote was painful to read because they pointed out all the bureaucratic and dysfunctional things that get in the way of serving clients working as a team or implementing new ideas but we were resolute in keeping the dialog freeflowing and candid and i dontthink what resultedbroad enthusiastic grassroots consensuscould have been obtained in any other way in the end ibmers determined that our actions will be driven by these values  dedication to every clients success  innovation that matters for our company and for the world  trust and personal responsibility in all relationships i must tell you this process has been very meaningful to me we are getting back in touch with what ibm has always been aboutand always will be aboutin a very concrete way and i feel that ive been handed something every ceo craves a mandate for exactly the right kinds of transformation from an entire workforce where will this lead it is a work in progress and many of the implications remain to be discovered what i can tell you is that we are rolling up our sleeves to bring ibms values to life in our policies procedures and daily operations ive already touched on a number of things relating to clients and innovation but our values of trust and personal responsibility are being managed just as seriouslyfrom changes in how we measure and reward performance to how we equip and support ibmers community volunteerism our values underpin our relationships with investors as well in late february the board of directors approved sweeping changes in executive compensation they include innovative programs that ensure investors first receive meaningful returnsa  percent increase in the stock pricebefore ibms top  executives can realize a penny of profit from their stock option grants putting that into perspective ibms market value would have to increase by  billion before executives saw any benefit from this years option awards in addition these executives will be able to acquire marketpriced stock options only if they first invest their own money in ibm stock we believe these programs are unprecedented certainly in our industry and perhaps in business clearly leading by values is very different from some kinds of leadership demonstrated in the past by business it is empowering and i think thats much healthier rather than burden our people with excessive controls we are trusting them to make decisions and to act based on valuesvalues they themselves shaped to me its also just common sense in todays world where everyone is so interconnected and interdependent it is simply essential that we work for each others success if were going to solve the biggest thorniest and most widespread problems in business and society we have to innovate in ways that truly matter and we have to do all this by taking personal responsibility for all of our relationshipswith clients colleagues partners investors and the public at large this is ibms mission as an enterprise and a goal toward which we hope to work with many others in our industry and beyond playing offense put it all togethera more focused business model an industry shift that plays to our strengths bets that are paying off in the near term and a workforce that is united and impatient to become the great company we all aspire to beand i feel good about ibm and our prospects without the prod of fear or of a burning platform weve begun a substantial transformation of our company for the first time in a very long time probably since my early days with ibm  years agoim seeing a company ready to focus more on opportunities than on threats more intent on setting the agenda than on reacting to the moves of others our deepseated optimisma fundamental belief that ibmers have always possessed in progress science and the improvability of the human conditionis reasserting itself ibmers are ready to reclaim a position of leadershipin our industry and in the larger world of business which is a very exciting place to be for me and my colleagues its just terrific to be part of an energized ibm company that is once again ready to play some offense ,6.558,1.0
87,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2004,dear ibm investor last year i told you that ibm was in the process of becoming a very different company i said that we had achieved a new degree of clarity about our business modelinnovation for the enterprise and that this was driving change in every aspect of the corporation and i described the deeper level of this reexaminationour collective work to redefine ibms core valuesnow its a year later and i want to tell you about the progress we have made ibm today is stronger and more focused than it has been in years the path we set for ourselves several years ago is yielding resultsin terms of an improved competitive position an enhanced capacity to innovate and a greater ability to deliver results to our clients and to you our owners our task now comes down to execution at a recent meeting with ibms senior leaders i said that  is the year of small s and big e less focus on strategic development maximum push on execution this is the appropriate emphasis for our company today because most of the major strategic pieces are now in place for ibm to become the leader of a rapidly changing information technology industry a good year i want to explain to you what we did last year to turn strategy and vision into results your company turned in another good year in  we continued to execute our business plan effectively producing share gains in key markets increasing revenue and growing both earnings and earnings per share our results from continuing operations saw record revenue of  billion an increase of  percent earnings of  billion an increase of  percent and diluted earnings per share of  an increase of  percent one of the strengths of our business model from a financial point of view is the amount of cash we generate after committing  billion to rd in  we had  billion in cash available for investment and distribution to shareholders of that  billion went for net capital expenditures and  billion for acquisitions that strengthened our capabilities we were able to return a record  billion to investors  billion through share repurchase and  billion through dividends we ended the year in a strong cash position with  billion including marketable securities in  our return on invested capital increased to  percent  excluding our global financing business and a onetime pension settlement chargewe were able to achieve these results because of our performance in the marketplace  ibm global services is the leading it services company in the world with more than twice the revenue of our nearest rival we are ranked number one in it outsourcing application management and ebusiness hosting in  global services revenue grew  percent to  billion driven by continued growth in strategic outsourcing as well as revenue increases in integrated technology services and business consulting services led by strong growth in business transformation outsourcing although signings and backlog declined in  global services improved its rate of revenue growth in every quarter excluding the benefit of currency due to the improving yield of our backlog and current signings  our software revenue totaled  billion an increase of  percent we gained share in key segments and held our leading share position in middleware overall websphere grew  percent rational  percent and tivoli  percent  we continue as number one in the world in servers with zseries pseries and xseries each increasing its share position in  ibm is the market leader in the superhot category of blade servers with revenue growing more than  percent for the year industry analyst idc estimates that by  one of every four servers will be a blade we had challenging product transitions in storage systems and iseries which hurt us personal computer revenue growth was strong for the year technology oem growth was good and we continue to see yield improvements in our semiconductor operation overall our hardware revenue was  billion an increase of  percent  revenue in all of ibms industry sectorswhich is the way we serve our largest clients globallygrew for the full year led by the financial services communications and distribution sectors we continued our strong growth in sales to small and mediumsize businesses which grew by  percent  we grew and expanded our business in the worlds hypergrowth markets we have learned over many years that the best way to pursue opportunities in emerging markets is to make investments and build relationships for the long haul to become part of the local economy and to help advance the societys broader goals we are doing that in china india brazil and russiaand its yielding good results ibms business in these four key emerging markets grew more than  percent in  to more than  billion the year had its share of challenges and some parts of the business fell short but overall it was a solid year for the ibm company the results confirm that we are in the right businesses and the right segments of the industry a transaction and a transformation of course just as significant as the segments we are in are those we are not the industrys contraction in recent years has forced it companies to choose between being highvalue innovation players or highvolume distributors of other peoples intellectual capital companies that are caught in the middle run the risk of being hammered from both below and above as i described to you last year weve made our choice ibm is an innovation company of course declaring something like that is easy it has taken a great deal of discipline to execute for instance over the past several years while we increased our presence in software consulting and infrastructure services we exited or reduced our presence in commoditizing businesses like hard disk drives memory chips and networking hardware and most notably this past december we announced our agreement for lenovo chinas computer leader to acquire ibms personal computing division these kinds of decisions are hard for many companies indeed some wont make thembecause it means parting with business models and technologies that were once their crown jewels in our own case ibm invented the hard disk drive and dram chip and we set the standard in pcs back in we take enormous pride in these achievements but if you intend to remain the innovation leader you commit yourself to continuous reinvention youve got to do the hard work every day to discover and develop new capabilities  and new ways of workingthat will keep you moving forward the new lenovo will be the worlds thirdlargest pc business it will have greater global reach and greater economies of scale and we will continue to work together to deliver worldclass pc solutions in the marketplace theres no doubt in my mind that this was the best path forward for our personal computer business for ibm our pc transaction  perhaps the most widely commentedupon event of the year for uswas certainly a milestone but not i would argue for the reasons many believe we could simply have sold our pc business instead what we did was to reposition both that business and ibm itself in ways that help each and that align with the future trajectory of the it market this deal crystallizes as well as any single event could the nature of our business model strategy and marketplace position today ibm is an enterprisefocused company it is not our strength or intention to participate directly in consumer markets we are all about innovation we are best at creating and delivering differentiating value to our clients we are a global business much more than marketing products and services around the world this means establishing deep roots locally and leveraging our multinational presence for operational advantage to explain our perspective on both the it industry and ibms transformation lies beyond the scope of an annual report however i do believe it is vital for anyone with an interest in ibm to understand this longterm view and what lies behind itnot a mere cyclical change but a major structural shift in our industry that is why we created the document understanding our company an ibm prospectus which accompanies this years annual report i encourage you to take a look at it i think it will help explain how we see the world and how that is driving our actions the meaning of  several major shiftsin business models in technology and in how they together are reshaping our industryhave driven everything weve done at ibm over the past four years they continued to do so in   because clients now demand that information technology be intimately integrated with their business operations we have reshaped ibms business skills assets and delivery capability this has involved everything from our acquisition of pricewaterhousecoopers consulting in  to the launch of multiple industry and processspecific practices and lines of business some people may see this simply as ibm bulking up in services it is true that we needed to add a lot of deep business expertiseand we will continue to strengthen our hand here but clients want more than the consultants strategic advice the systems integrators skills or the it outsourcers scale they want new business designs enabled by technology that give them some quantifiable competitive advantage they want new options and alternatives not only in how they manage it but in how they conceptualize and manage their companies this is what we mean by on demand business ceos might not use that exact term yet but a more responsive virtually integrated company is increasingly what they are asking us to help them build companies like ebay bank of america and metro group and institutions like miamidade county and the new museum of modern art are to one degree or another on demand enterprises i want to highlight one aspect of on demand business because it represents a very large new market opportunity for us we call it business performance transformation servicesbpts and industry analyst idc sizes it at about  trillion as large as the existing global it industry we peg the part of bpts that ibm is addressing at about  billion as its name suggests bpts involves helping clients optimize their operations through new business designs and processes and in some cases turning over those operations to expert partners to manage as you can imagine this is a very different type of services businessone that is increasingly assetbased it requires deep knowledge of business processes like logistics supply chain and human resource management and relies heavily on automated processes and intellectual capital not mere labor arbitrage in  we extended our capabilities in bpts making substantial investments in four areasbusiness transformation outsourcing engineering and technology services strategy and change consulting and business performance management software we generated more than  billion in revenue in these four areasup about  percent over the previous year and our software and services groups are working together to build out an infrastructure that fuses business transformation with information technologywhat is called servicesoriented architectureto support our evolution to an assetbased services business  because we saw that computing was undergoing a fundamental shift we developed the architecture and technologies for the on demand operating environment based on open standards the new computing architecture is based on a truly networked world and the emergence of open standardsfor the first time in our industrys historyas well as some exciting new technologies and new ways of accessing and managing it it builds on our strengths in enterprise computing core technology and software one of our most important core technologies is our power microprocessor family whats significant about power is not just that its fast and packs a lot of punch plenty of microprocessors do power is highly customizableconsider  power processors are at the heart of our blue gene supercomputer which last year set a new record more than  trillion calculations per second yet variations of power chips are also the foundation for our pseries and iseries and are used in our blade servers our storage systems and an expanding array of devicesnetwork routers mobile devices game consolesdesigned by our oem partners built on a power core the cell processora supercomputer on a chipwas developed along with sony and toshiba for broadband highdefinition uses increasing the uses of the power family is important for ibm because it gives us the advantages of a highperformance processor and highvolume economics this is one reason weve opened powers technical specifications through our power everywhere and powerorg initiatives we are building a broader ecosystem of innovation around power reflecting the fact that innovation today is an increasingly collaborative processand not only in software and speaking of software through steady internal development and select acquisitions over the past several years ibm has become the leader in enterpriseclass middleware which helps companies integrate and manage their operations an important differentiator for our software business is that it is entirely built on open standards supporting a wide variety of hardware platforms and applications this gives our clients flexibility and choice and makes it easy for them to integrate their infrastructure and business operations  these two elements of on demand  new business models and a new computing infrastructure  are now coming together in ways that will redefine the industry and play to ibms strengths all of these changesbusinesses weve exited those weve entered our increased investments the technologies and practices weve inventedwere undertaken not simply to assemble a portfolio even a portfolio of highvalue businesses but to do something with them namely we aim to give our clients capabilities they cannot get either from another company or even a collection of other companies this is why weve worked hard to forge connections between our services and software businesses our semiconductor unit and our server and storage units between ibm research and every other part of the company and between ibm and an increasing variety of business partners ibms strategy is less about going to market with a more complete array of capabilities than it is about leveraging those capabilities to create new intellectual capital for clients priorities going forward as we move ahead in  we are guided by the same priorities that have shaped our progress thus far we will make on demand business a fuller reality for clients the concept is no longer in dispute enterprises are achieving tangible benefits from being on demandand are increasingly embracing its longterm strategic promise for competitive advantage we will work with a growing roster of clients who want to become on demand enterprises and we will continue to build out the technologies and services for the on demand operating environment we will continue to deepen ibms capabilities as a company built on innovation this is our business model and has been since the companys inception it has shaped our transformation over the past several years and it continues to shape the evolution of our workforce strategy management systems economics and client relationshipswe will focus in  on execution this is that big e message i gave to ibms leaders at the beginning of this year all of our strategic work over the past four years has given us considerable capabilities to seize the growth and profit opportunities ive described now we have to improve our ability to integrate all of this capability for our clients in other words we need to become even more of an on demand business ourselves and a big part of that is what i call lowering the center of gravity of our company for us this is neither conventional decentralization nor simple delegation it means shifting resources closer to the point of contact with the client creating enterprisewide processes that are commonly shared and establishing truly global operations that capitalize on the talent and scale now available in every part of the world every time we have simplified the company and pushed authority and resources closer to where the daytoday action is weve seen great resultswith clients because we are easier to do business with in our cost structure because we eliminate unnecessary layers in revenue growth because we differentiate ourselves from the competition and in how individual ibmers feel about their company last year i told you about the online jam in which ibmers collectively defined our values for the first time in nearly a century i told you what an outpouring of passion imagination and pride that was well even more impressive was the followup jam we held last fall this time we asked ibmers to contribute ideas to make our values a daytoday reality in the company participation was extraordinary  more than  ibmers contributed more than  comments and ideas and the ideas were concrete practical and focused on execution the toprated ideas range from backoffice integration supporting the development and marketing of integrated solutions to helping firstline managers by giving them more authority over budgets and freeing up their time to devote to their people to clearing away the barriers that inhibit us from collaborating innovating and contributing to ibms growth these and dozens of other ideas are now in various stages of implementation and i am confident that they will make a material difference to ibm our values are also being turned into actions every day in countless other ways how we work with our clients and colleagues the actions of ibms crisis response team after the asian tsunami disaster or the progress of the world community grid  harnessing vast unused computational power to help cure disease and forecast natural disasters from the point of view of a ceo perhaps the best aspect of this entire process has been the broad platform it creates to drive change when your primary organizational challenge is one of execution there is nothing more encouraging than the knowledge that your organizations direction and sense of mission come not out of some threat or crisis but from the aspirations of your own workforce for  ibmersand you can count me among themwhat drives us every day is a determination to make ibm the great company we all want and expect it to be,7.479,1.0
88,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2005,dear ibm investor in my letters to you over the past several years i have described ibms view of how the information technology industry is being radically reshaped by developments in technology its application in business and the onrush of globalization i have also reported on the actions we have taken to capitalize on these shifts and to position our company for longterm prosperity  as a result of these actions ibm has emerged from this period a very different company we are much more focused on the highvalue segments of our industry better balanced more productive and more profitable than just a few years ago our solid results in  are a consequence of this repositioning and of the innovation and marketplace execution of more than  ibmers around the world our revenue in  was  billion up  percent without our divested personal computer business revenue as reported was  billion down  percent pretax earnings from continuing operations were  billion an increase of  percent and diluted earnings per share were  up  percent excluding nonrecurring items our earnings per share increased  percent to  particularly noteworthy was a rise of  points in ibms gross profit margin to  percent after investing  billion in rd  billion in net capital expenditures and  billion for acquisitions we ended the year with  billion of cash including marketable securities over the past several years ibm has consistently generated return on invested capital significantly above the average for the sp  and we did so again in  with roic of  percent excluding global financing and nonrecurring items we were able to return a record of nearly  billion to you   billion through share repurchase and  billion through dividends after lots of hard work to remix our portfolio of businesses and to improve ibms overall competitiveness i believe the headwinds we faced entering the decade are largely behind us in this letter i will describe the performance of ibms three major businesses i will also describe why i believe that our business model based on the twin pillars of integration and innovation and underpinned by a strong financial footing is unique and why we are strongly positioned to capture the most attractive growth and profit opportunities in the years ahead leadership businesses and leadership results our results in  were achieved through the marketplace performance of our major businesses  systems and technology software and services let me describe that performance briefly for each systems and technology our companys technology strength is the result of longterm investments weve made over many years investments that are now bearing fruit last year ibms systems and technology business extended its industry leadership enhancing its competitive standing and staking out advantageous positions in growth markets of the future since  ibms total share of the server market has grown  points in annual revenue according to industry analyst idc our systems and technology revenues in  were up  percent in the fourth quarter shipments of mips millions of instructions per second for our zseries mainframes grew  percent yeartoyear  our largest quarter of mips shipments on record leading to our highest mainframe revenue since the fourth quarter of  pseries unix servers had a strong year growing  percent with doubledigit growth in all geographies we believe this was the fourth straight year of improvement in pseries market position we expect to maintain our leadership in the fastgrowing blade server business with a  growth rate of  percent in addition our system storage business was up  percent for the year driven by our mainstay disk and tape products and our emerging technologies also gained momentum such as storage virtualization which added  clients led by our sweep of the three major gaming platforms ibms microelectronics business achieved  percent growth revenue from our millimeter wafer products grew strongly in  including more than  percent growth in the fourth quarter engineering  technology services grew  percent for the year the cell broadband engine our revolutionary microprocessor developed through a unique technology collaboration with sony and toshiba is bringing the capabilities of supercomputerlevel simulation to multiple arenas including consumer electronics healthcare and defense recently we combined a number of these engineering and technology operations into a new unit technology collaboration solutions to bring greater focus and resources to the opportunities we see in collaborative innovation there is large and growing demand across engineeringintensive industries  from automotive and aerospace to telecommunications and medical equipment  to leverage the technologies and research prowess of partners this is not outsourced rd but true shouldertoshoulder collaboration the ability to extend ibms legendary technology strengths to clients to accelerate their own product and service rd is a powerful proposition that no one in our industry can easily match software software revenues totaled  billion in  an increase of  percent we believe we improved our competitive position in all five of our key middleware brands indeed  marked a milestone for our software business as ive reported to you for several years we have been focusing our internal software rd and acquisition efforts on the highgrowth middleware segment of the software opportunity last year for the first time more than half of our software revenue came from strategic middleware products vs the slower growth host or legacy platforms in software as in systems the technology bets we made several years ago are paying off companies are seeking to dissolve barriers that impede the flow of information within the enterprise by deploying open standardsbased middleware to integrate their it systems and to maximize digital assets in all their forms there is a significant shift underway in the world of software toward what is called serviceoriented architecture soa which allows companies to be much more flexible and responsive as the worldwide leader in middleware ibm is in a strong position to capitalize on the soa market which some analysts expect to more than double to  billion by  our websphere middleware family grew  percent in  with particular strength in application servers and portals which grew  percent and  percent respectively information management software grew  percent fueled by our content management and information integration products a set of offerings that we are enhancing with a  billion investment in a new information on demand practice we announced this february including advanced tools and  additional practitioners located in centers of excellence around the world our rational software tools grew  percent for the year and tivoli  percent including  percent growth for tivoli storage software as clients continued their strong adoption of our virtualization technologies in addition our  acquisitions of companies such as ascential bowstreet srd and dwl have strengthened our hand in other highgrowth areas including business integration and webenabled software global services ibm global services remains the leading it services company in the world with more than twice the revenue of our nearest rival we are ranked as the numberone service provider in it outsourcing web hosting and consulting  systems integration revenues from global services in  totaled  billion an increase of  percent our backlog is estimated at  billion the same as a year ago weve been seeing a transition in services over the past few years a shift to smaller deals of shorter duration these are good opportunities  if you can recalibrate your sales model to capture them in addition to the traditional megadeals and the profitability of these kinds of deals is very attractive if your global cost structure is competitive we had to address both our sales model and services cost structure last year and we did so we also took other actions to strengthen our services business  shifting thousands of employees into global delivery centers rebalancing our integrated technology services portfolio and doubling the resources dedicated to integrated solutions which we expect will account for  percent of the total it opportunity by  these changes give us a platform for increasing growth in  i want to call out in particular our continuing progress in the highgrowth market we call business performance transformation services this is where we apply our technology prowess and economies of scale to running and transforming business processes for our clients  from supply chain to human resources to logistics and more our bpts revenue increased  percent in  to  billion we have more than tripled our resources focused on bpts since early  several of our  acquisitions in  were aimed at strengthening our bpts capabilities in such areas as healthcare the ordertocash cycle and applications on demand for small and medium businesses were increasing investments in engineering collaboration and we recently created a new unit to consolidate and accelerate our efforts in business transformation outsourcing including a promising opportunity to deliver more standardized business processing services mainly to smaller enterprises integrate to innovate each of our three major businesses is a multifaceted leader in its own right but they are not standalone entities they work together in a model defined by integration and innovation  the imperatives that we believe are increasingly shaping business and society in the st century this ability to integrate and innovate is unique to ibm and sets us apart from our competition  innovation is increasingly what businesses and institutions of all kinds seek in response to a flattening world of evermore intense and global competition that sounds simple enough but its not just about building a better mousetrap the kind of innovation companies need today goes beyond products or services involving all aspects of the enterprise from business processes and models to management systems culture and policies accomplishing this kind of systemic innovation requires a unique blend of business and technology and a deep understanding of the new tools techniques and capabilities that have come of age today  integration of technology with business design is now possible as never before  and therefore is necessary as never before for companies that hope to remain competitive after decades of new technology invention we are entering a phase familiar to economic historians who study technological revolutions this is when new technologies get infused into every aspect of business and society and this is when lasting value is created and real money gets made increasingly today its playing out on a global stage  and that in turn is driving a new model of the corporation itself were shifting away from the th century multinational and toward a new way to integrate the components of business activity on a global basis we call this the globally integrated enterprise those who succeed in this new era will seize upon innovation and integration to differentiate themselves from their rivals  including the new ones that will arise continually from all corners of an increasingly interconnected planet weve been talking for several years about the bifurcation of our industry and the fundamental choice that companies in it have to make between two radically different business models one of those is to compete on low price in rapidly commoditizing segments these types of businesses focus on revenue growth but their models based on commodity products and services inherently do not produce superior profit margins the other is to compete by creating unique differentiating value through innovation as you know we have chosen to be the provider of highvalue innovative solutions but candidly we were not well positioned to be a highvalue leader as recently as a few years ago we were weighed down by commoditizing business lines with eroding profit margins today we have succeeded in moving almost entirely out of commoditizing areas in addition we have shifted our transaction mix more toward higher value solutions and away from individual product sales in large measure as a result of those changes our gross profit margin is the best its been since  and the company is much better balanced in terms of profit contribution when you exclude secondquarter restructuring charges and pcs about  percent of our profit last year was from software including enterprise investments about  percent from systems and financing and about  percent from services an innovation company if you understand the broad economic and societal changes taking place the transformation of our company to capitalize on them and the resulting mix of our business it should be apparent that ibm in  is neither a computer company nor a services company we are not even an it company ibm today perhaps more than any time in our history is an innovation company we have a distinctive point of view on how innovation is changing and a unique set of capabilities to enable our clients to capture its benefits in a word we are their innovation partner we make them innovative  the innovators innovator if you will youd never see this though if you only looked through the lens of the it industrys traditional segmentation hardware software services and their many productspecific subsets further that view doesnt just obscure the picture of ibm it also distorts the reality of how technology is acquired and used by businesses today companies governmental agencies educational and healthcare organizations and other enterprises and institutions everywhere are faced with opportunities and threats and in response they need to innovate thats the industry we are part of and those are the marketplace realities everyone in it needs to address for ibmers this deeper notion of innovation is what we mean when we talk about innovation that matters one of three core values we collectively defined for our company three years ago in one of our allcompany jams ibmers around the world are tremendously excited about the possibilities being unlocked by this broad and ambitious notion of innovation and were eager to share our point of view with clients partners and our thousands of collaborators across business government education and every area of society to that end we have prepared a companion document to this annual report describing some of the powerful tools techniques and new models that are available and affordable for innovators today its a great time to be an innovator also contains the stories of ibm clients who are using these new capabilities to enhance their own unique strengths and thus achieve differentiation and competitive advantage i think youll find it informative and i hope it stimulates ideas about how your own organization or community could benefit from the new possibilities for innovation an integrated company for ibm the key to capturing all this value were creating through innovation is to integrate it for our clients operationally that raises two key questions where is it best for that integration to occur and around what i believe the right place to integrate ibm is close to the action  which is why weve been working hard to lower the center of gravity of our company starting in europe for instance we implemented a new management system in  that flattened the organizational structure and moved more clientfacing leaders out into local markets  the biggest such change there in nearly half a century it used to be that  percent of executives were in headquarters offices now  percent of them are working incountry in addition we have tripled the number of people working in or serving emerging markets such as china india brazil and russia  where together our business grew  percent last year excluding pcs at the same time we have shifted pricing authority down to the country level we also created deal hubs to give our teams a single point of contact for sales support and other client services theyve been an immediate success win rates are up across the board  with doubledigit increases in the countries of europe where we piloted the hubs we will roll out new deal hubs in the americas asia australia and additional parts of europe in the first half of this year when it comes to the second question  on what basis are we integrating  the answer lies in our core values for the ibmers who shaped these values they are much more than vague aspirations they are in fact a set of decisionmaking criteria that guide how we organize and run the company a little more than a year ago tens of thousands of ibmers came together to turn our values into dozens of specific actions and changes  many of which we implemented in  ive described some of them such as the deal hubs in this letter these steps to transform our company were crucial and that work will never stop but being a valuesmanaged company applies at the top as well thats why at the beginning of this year i decided to disband the senior leadership structure that had been in place in ibm for more than a decade and to replace it with one based on simpler clearer criteria for our top positions first we formed a new group of ibms seniormost leaders who will be accountable for the performance and execution of our business second we created a broader group that will focus specifically on integrating ibm on the basis of our values both groups met for the first time about a month ago to discuss how to bring to bear all of ibms capability to drive marketplace results i know from the teams energy and commitment that this move was the right thing to do innovation that matters these days youd have to look long and hard to find a company that doesnt say it is committed to innovation but innovation of the sort ive discussed here  the kind thats grounded in the integration of business and technology that draws on multifaceted collaboration and that functions in a truly global way  is devilishly hard for all the reasons ive shared with you in this letter i believe that ibm has an unmatched ability to deliver this sort of innovation we are the only company that couples broad expertise across industries and business processes with deep technology capability we have a unique understanding of information technologys potential and future trajectory because were at the forefront of creating both we are rapidly becoming a model of global integration  leveraging economies of scale and expertise for the benefit of our clients and our own operational effectiveness and while many companies consult or offer piecepart technologies and services we are distinct in our ability to integrate the right technologies expertise and partnerships in ways that enable our clients to be truly special innovation that matters is finally central to ibms identity  to why our employees choose us why our partners and clients look to collaborate with us and why you our owners invest in us and interestingly this same vision is showing up more and more these days among companies governments educators healthcare practitioners and communities around the world for ibm this is gratifying and hopeful as we enter a promising new era i am proud of the worldwide ibm team for bringing us to this point  and i am grateful to you our shareholders for your support as we have repositioned the company to be the innovation leader i and my colleagues are delighted and challenged by the prospect of advancing this work and by what together with our clients our partners and you we can do to lead it,7.934,1.0
89,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2006,dear ibm investor i am happy to report to you on a very strong year for our company in my letter last year i said that we believed we had positioned ourselves to capture the most attractive growth and profit opportunities in our industry in  we did just that setting new records in profit earnings per share and cash performance what our numbers do not revealand what is perhaps ibms most notable accomplishment during this periodis that we achieved these results while fundamentally reshaping our company whether you look at our technology strategy business model processes or culture ibm is a very different enterprise today than it was at the beginning of the decade we have prepared the company for growth and leadership in a radically different futurewhile continuing to deliver steady resultsibm had a strong year in  revenue as reported was  billion up  percent excluding pcs from our  results pretax earnings from continuing operations were  billion an increase of  percent diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were  up  percent marking  straight quarters of growth ibm has consistently generated return on invested capital significantly above the average for the sp  over the past several years and we did so again in  with roic of  percent excluding our global financing businessibms gross profit margin rose for the third consecutive yearto  percent an increase of  points in  up more than five points since  our pretax income margin rose to  percent an increase of  points both margins are at their highest in the past  years significantly as i will discuss they were achieved primarily by remixing our business to highervalue segments and by driving efficiency through global integration in many respects ibm is a highertorque engine today with revenue growth that matches our segments of the industry we have been able to generate strong profit and cash in  we generated net cash from operations excluding a yeartoyear change in global financing receivables of  billionan increase of  billion from last year and our highest on record in addition net cash generated from every dollar of revenue has increased  percent since  ibm ended  with  billion of cash and marketable securities and of course stronger earnings and cash give us more flexibility to increase returns to you and to invest in future sources of growth our net  cash investment of  billion for  acquisitionsnine of them in key strategic areas of software was up  billion year to year after investing  billion in rd and  billion in net capital expenditures we were able to return a record of nearly  billion to you billion through share repurchase and  billion through dividendsor more than  percent of our net earnings in april  we announced a percent increase in our quarterly dividend the largest percentage increase in ibm history and the nd consecutive dividend paid by ibm this was the th year in a row in which we have increased our dividend our balance sheet remains strong and the company is well positioned to take advantage of new strategic opportunitiesstrategic choices in order to understand how we achieved these results i think it is helpful to look back to the major strategic choices we made several years ago they were by no means obvious at the time and most it companies chose different paths but as we entered the new century we were convinced that three developments would be of paramount importance to ibm and our clients  we believed that our clients would place a premium on innovation what technology company doesnt say its all about innovation but if you really take this seriously then you have to commit your company to continuous adaptation and change such is the nature of our industry and many it companies learn that lesson the hard way today its clear that computing is radically changingfrom the data center and the network to the proliferation of technology into the home appliances vehicles and the infrastructure of the planet and its equally clear that businesses and institutions worldwide now look to innovation as their key to competitive differentiation and growth to capture the most valuable opportunities weve had to change our mix of products services skills and technologies this is why weve exited businesses like pcs and hard disk drives and why through a combination of internal rd shifts and acquisitions we have substantially strengthened our position in emerging highervalue spaces such as serviceoriented architecture soa information on demand business process services and open modular systems for businesses of all sizes  we believed that both our industry and our clients would seek to reintegrate but it would not be integration as in the pastproduct bundling turnkey solutions or consolidation of industry segments instead businesses would increasingly seek to integrate advanced technology with their business processes and operations even their core business model why because this kind of integration would make them both more productive and more innovative it would give them differentiation and competitive advantages they could not get from offtheshelf technology and solutions conceptually this is an ideal role for ibm to playthe innovators innovator but since this kind of integration requires intimate knowledge of each client it cannot be done in the lab or on the plant floor and it certainly cant be done in headquarters it has meant an ongoing effort to change our processes and structures to push decision making close to the marketplacewhat we internally call lowering the center of gravity of ibm  we believed that globalization would fundamentally change business because of free trade policies the internet and the emergence of highly skilled populations we believed that globalization would arrive in full force and with it the reality that anyone could capitalize on expertise and market conditions everywhere in the world we believed this opportunity would soon become an economic imperative businesses institutions industries and societies would need to adapt to the changing environment one important aspect of this was a change in the form of the corporation itself the multinational of the th century was evolving into a new kind of institution the globally integrated enterprise  which locates its operations and functions anywhere in the world based on the right cost the right skills and the right business environment we committed ourselves to becoming a model of this new form and we have begun transforming ibms operations accordingly tapping into skills and expertise available all over the world and integrating our operations globally we have also begun a promising dialogue with our clients and with government business and academic leaders around the world to explore the potential of global integration for economic and societal progress as a result of these strategic choices and actions ibms business model today is not only more aligned with our clients needs but is also a stronger engine of financial performance that was evident in  our innovationdriven strategy and financial model are also putting us in a favorable position relative to our competitors within each area of our business mix business mix and results some of ibms competitorsthose who are not as focused do not have the financial capacity to invest or are trying to straddle commodity and highervalue businesses are struggling to deal with the changes underway today as we have learned its better to be in businesses that are truly differentiating in the eyes of the client than to go simply for size volume and thin marginswhere the client doesnt receive unique value and the investor doesnt benefit this is why we have entered new more attractive spaces through acquisition and by redirecting our rd investments let me describe how these shifts are impacting each of our major businesses  software in the world of software we are witnessing a shift toward new architectures and the componentization of applications this new model inherently networked and based upon open standards enables different business designs and the horizontal integration of business processes within the enterprise its main impact is occurring at the level of middleware because we began years ago to build a position as the worldwide leader in middleware ibm is now uniquely able to capitalize on it ibms software segment revenues totaled  billion in  an increase of  percent software generated  percent of ibms segment pretax profits we are recognized as the industry leader in soa the information on demand practice we launched in  grouped under information management grew  percent our acquisition of companies such as filenet mro and micromuse enhanced our growth in information and systems management our industryleading websphere family grew  percent for the year with particular strength in application servers and business integration rational software tools grew  percent and tivoli  percent our lotus division which introduced wellreceived web enabled collaboration tools for the enterprise in early grew  percent we will be expanding our software offerings in  to move beyond oneonone and team collaborationintroducing tools that build communities of expertise  global services the global services industry is being reshaped by two trends the first is the emergence of a new services model based on the integration of software and services and the breakingup of formerly monolithic business processes into components that can be delivered over the web ibm global services is leading the industry in the development of business componentization and the technology enablement of business processes the second trend is a shift to smaller deals of shorter duration higher profitability and more industryspecific focus while our transition to this model experienced some hiccups initially we are making steady progress and saw solid growth in shortterm signings in  ibm remains the leading it services company in the world with more than twice the revenue of our nearest rival revenues from our two global services segments in  totaled  billion an increase of  percent services share of ibms segment pretax profits increased to  percent revenues from the global technology services segment totaled  billion an increase of  percent revenues from the global business services segment were essentially flat at  billion but improvements in utilization pricing contract management and delivery optimization enabled it to grow its pretax margin by  points to  percent excluding  special actions ibm global services is ranked as the number one or number two service provider in consulting systems integration maintenance web hosting application services and data center outsourcing with a strong finish to the yearthe fourth quarter with nearly  billion in signings was our largest since the second quarter of we ended  with an estimated backlog of  billion  systems and technology ibm is the world leader in servers and is leading a number of key changes in the industry including shifts to multicore microprocessors to highend virtualized systems and to the new category of modular systems known as blades in  we rolled out systems based on the new generation of our power architecture family power introduced the system z business class mainframe targeting smaller firms and extended our virtualization and energy management capabilities our systems and technology business extended its industry leadership in  with segment revenues of  billion an increase of  percent global financing segment revenues totaled  billion a decrease of  percent our system z mainframes had a strong year growing  percent and marking their sixth consecutive quarter of increased shipments of mips millions of instructions per second our system storage business was up  percent for the year and our microelectronics business continued to grow increasing  percent for the year thanks to our position as the technology engine for all three major gaming platforms systems and technology group and global financing accounted for  percent of ibms segment pretax profit in  the hard work weve done to remix our businesses to lead in these emergent higherprofit spaces is now showing up in our earnings and gross profit margins but a changed business mix is not the only factor causing ibms strong performanceinnovation and global integration ibms lines of business work together in a model defined by innovation and global integration the twin imperatives that we believe are reshaping business and society in the st century this ability to both innovate and integrate and do so in ways that are truly globalis unique to ibm and sets us apart from our competition last year was in many ways the culmination of our repositioning of ibm as an innovation company its most visible manifestation was our marketing and communications campaign around the theme what makes you special of course marketing campaigns by themselves are of little importanceunless they persuade the world of an underlying reality that is substantial and meaningful ours did supported by a long list of clients whose innovation potential we have unleashed through unique solutions it was also supported by the continued preeminence of ibms research and development capabilities reflected in our th straight year of earning by far the most us patents of any company in the world our ability to deliver differentiating innovation to our clients is being greatly enhanced by ibms global integration which is simultaneously giving us better economics and deeper capabilities while eliminating enormous redundancies that were built up over  years as a multinational ibm operates in  countries with about  percent of our employees outside the us including  percent in asia pacific our nonus operations generate about  percent of ibms revenue ibms research and software development have long been globally integrated the companys rd system assigns work among our plus software developers in  labs in  countries and  scientists and technologists in ibm research centers in the us china israel switzerland japan and india based on areas of unique expertise in  we expanded our global delivery centers where talented ibmers support the full range of our clients applications and business transformation initiatives we added thousands of skilled people and improved our capabilities in india brazil and argentina as well as eastern europe and multiple other locations in asia we have moved our global procurement mission to china and many of the services that support our external and internal websites to places like brazil and ireland our financing back office is in rio de janeiro these ibmers are not leading teams focused on china or india or brazil or ireland they are leading integrated global operations in addition to integrating the entire company globally we are investing to extend our leadership within the fastestgrowing markets we have tripled the number of people working in or serving markets such as china india brazil and russia in the past four years our business there excluding pcs grew  percent last year over the next four years we expect these markets to grow at more than two times the worldwide rate with an opportunity of more than  billion by  in the mayjune  issue of the public policy journal foreign affairs i described our point of view on the globally integrated enterprise and this idea has struck a chord with many leaders around the world we are now working actively across ibms broad ecosystem to explore the promiseand challengesof this new model we believe it offers hope for a new kind of globalization one that not only generates vast new opportunity but that also vastly expands the chances for all people on the planet to share in it a distinctive way of thinking to many of us ibms transformation of the past few years while dramatic has not felt unfamiliar for me and others in my generation the experience has not been one of entering uncharted waters but of returning to a pace of change a level of impact and a type of thinking that drew us to this company in the first place and its origins go back a long way for nearly a century businesses institutions and individuals have sought a relationship with ibm because of this companys unique ability to conceptualize opportunities to analyze developments and to reimagine how the world could work for nearly a century literally millions of women and men have been drawn here to be part of an enterprise that above all grounded itself in lasting values and that valued above all the capacity of its people to think today those values and that kind of thinking are deepening and taking on more and more exciting new forms one example in  was innovationjaman open brainstorming event on ibms worldwide intranet that engaged more than  ibmers their family members ibm clients and partners from business and academia we shared a few of our crown jewels some of the latest technologies from ibms labs then together we explored how these new capabilities might be applied to urgent needs from the environment to healthcare to small global business to the emergence of a d internet and how those possibilities might spawn new highgrowth businesses we have assigned senior business owners to develop  of the most promising ideas and weve stripped away process so they can move quickly we also gave them a pool of  million in development funds to get them started the important point in this is that when you commit yourself to innovation that matters you free up talented people to try new thingsnew approaches new partnerships new markets that is you ask them to think to capture some of the essential elements of ibms way of working collaborating and approaching problems we have created a companion piece for this years annual report it is entitled appropriately enough think for all ibm investors and for anyone who is considering a relationship with our company either as a client a partner an employee or a neighboran understanding of what makes ibm tick is essential in gauging our prospects for the century ahead as we enter this new era of technology business and global society i am proud of the worldwide ibm team for bringing us to this point and i am grateful to you our shareholders for your support in our journey i hope and trust that you are pleased with how your company is growing and evolving my colleagues and i are excited by the possibilities for how together with our clients our partners and you we can bring this remarkable enterprise into its next phase of leadership and discovery,9.492,1.0
90,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2007,dear ibm investor i am very pleased to report to you on a superb year for your companya year of record revenue profit cash flow and earnings per share it reflects the hard work of some of the worlds brightest and most innovative women and menthe ibmers im proud to call my colleagues it is also the result of important strategic choices we made several years agochoices that have put ibm in a strong position to continue to grow profitably to strengthen our client relationships and to seize the most attractive opportunities in a very dynamic global economy ibm is a different company today to understand why let me briefly describe how we got to our present position at the beginning of the decade all of us in the information technology industryindeed in all of businesswere confronted with fundamental changes the reality of global integration a new computing model and new ways for businesses and institutions to apply technology to create value it was clear that we had to changeand not only to capture future opportunities the fact is if we had stayed still the companys competitiveness would have been at risk so we made important decisions and got to work global integration as the decade began we observed the accelerating integration of global economies and with it the emergence of two importanti would say historicopportunities we had a chance to capture rapid growth in dozens of countries as they invested heavily in information technology to modernize their societies and we could also tap into enormous populations of skills all over the world we set out to seize both opportunities weve made major investments in emerging markets building up our teams in nations all over the world at the same time we havebeen globally integrating ibms operations rapidly locating our work and functions wherever it makes the most sense based on the right cost the right skills and the right business environment today we have a truly global supply chain we develop software globally our network of research laboratories is worldwide and we deliver services on an unmatched global scale we are continuing to transform our processes and functions to move ibm to this profoundly new model of the corporation which we call the globally integrated enterprise technology ibm has been saying it for many years the basic computing model has changed the pc model of the s has receded in importance to clients and has been replaced by a new paradigm based on openness networks powerful new technology and the integration of digital intelligence into the fabric of work and life as you know we have dramatically changed our mix of products services skills and technologies we exited businesses like pcs and hard disk drivesbusinesses that we had invented we shifted our internal rd and have made more than  acquisitions over the past five years at the time many were skepticalbut one need only look at todays headlines to see how strongly some pcera leaders are trying to move away from the old model and embrace the new one ibms product and technology portfolio today is built around networked modularized and embedded technologies including serviceoriented architecture soa information on demand virtualization and open modular systems for businesses of all sizes ibm is a leader in all these areas business impelled by this new global arena and new technology model business leaders expanded their horizonsdriven both by competitive pressures and a remarkable array of new innovation capabilities no longer content with cost savings from offtheshelf technologies and solutions they were seeking to innovate and this involved not just their products and services but their entire companies business processes management systems policies and even their core business model to accomplish that they were looking to integrate advanced technology deep into their processes and operations our worldwide survey of ceos has consistently confirmed this shift in businesses perceptions and priorities to deliver this kind of client value requires intimate knowledge of each client and the ability to make that knowledge operational on a daily basisand that cant be done from corporate headquarters so we changed our own processes and organization to push decisionmaking and delegation closer to the marketplace put it all together and ibm today is very different from what it was when we entered the decade we are different strategically with clarity around our twin imperatives of innovation and global integration we are different operationally with a lower center of gravity in our operations and with continually improving efficiency and productivity and we have a business model that is better aligned with our clients needs and that generates stronger profitability and cash flow we see no major strategic shift on the horizon for our company so how is this transformed company performing let me briefly recap  it was quite simply a great year for ibm revenue and income we delivered our strongest revenue growth since  and our strongest profit performance in more than a decade our revenue as reported was a record  billion up  percent pretax income from continuing operations was  billion an increase of  percent and another record margins ibms gross profit margin rose for the fourth consecutive yearto  percent up more than five points since  we achieved this by continuing to shift our business mix to more profitable segments such as software and by focusing on productivity our pretax income margin rose to  percent both margins are at their highest in more than a decade the improvement in our pretax income margin compares very favorably to our technology peers and to the companies of the dow  we have reversed the margin decline of the late s and we have a stronger business model today with less volatility and more highprofit revenue opportunity earnings per share we have continued to achieve strong eps growth last year was another record with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of  up  percent this marked  straight quarters of eps growth cash flow ibm has consistently generated strong cash flow in  our net cash from operations excluding the yeartoyear change in global financing receivables was  billionan increase of  billion from last year our business model has allowed us to generate more than  billion in cash flow over the past five years ibm ended  with  billion of cash and marketable securities investment and return to shareholders our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the businessthrough strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to drive growthand to generate substantial returns to investors through increased dividends and significant share repurchase our  cash investment was  billion for  acquisitionssix of them in key areas of software and after investing  billion in rd and  billion in net capital expenditures we were able to return a record of nearly  billion to you billion through share repurchase and  billion through dividendsor more than  percent of our net earnings this years dividend increase was  percent marking the th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend in the last two years ibm has doubled its quarterly dividend our balance sheet remains strong and the company is well positioned to take advantage of new strategic opportunities the results of ibms strategic choices and actions over the last several years have been better client focus clearer marketplace differentiation and a stronger financial engine we have also achieved superior flexibilitya competitive advantage in uncertain economic times this strengthened business model and our excellent performance in  have increased our confidence that we will meet our  objective of  to  in earnings per share i think the information on pages  to  will help you understand the sources of that confidence we have entered  with strong momentumbut can we sustain it this is a legitimate question especially given the current economic indicators in the united states and other parts of the developed world a number of companies arent sounding very optimistic at ibm we have a different view the reason why is best understood in terms of five key factors that differentiate our company today  our global reach and scale ibms global operations are accelerating our companys growth ibm today does business in  countries and enjoys an increasingly broadbased geographic distribution of revenue in   percent of our revenue came from outside the united states many people think of emerging markets as the socalled bric countries of brazil russia india and chinaand last year our revenue increased  percent in those markets but our global footprint extends much farther consider more than  countries including czech republic poland malaysia singapore south africa venezuela and mexicoin each of which we grew more than  percent in local currency in  in aggregate ibms business in this group grew at a rate of more than  percent in local currency last year and comprised  percent of our geographic revenues  our infrastructure leadership ibm arguably invented the concept of the data center and today our solutions provide a foundation for more of the worlds it infrastructure than any other company so we are well positioned to serve businesses across the worlds emerging markets that are installing their first data centers as well as those in the developed world that are upgrading and transforming their existing infrastructure however todays opportunity is not simply about replicating or upgrading what already exists the data center itself is going through its most significant transformation in decades according to one it analyst firm more than  percent of global  companies will have to modify their data centers significantly during the next five years this is driven not only by new technology but by new business imperatives constraints on power and real estate systems that are grossly underutilized and the need for greater flexibility to innovate business processes and models these needs have shaped our transformed portfolio our green data center solutions dramatically impact energy efficiency and physical space constraints while also helping our planet demand is climbing for these solutions and we hit more than  million in signings last year after introducing the offering in the third quarter virtualization which significantly improves system utilization generated about  million in incremental gross profit for us in  and our industryleading solutions in soa enable clients to reinvent their entire business model clients in both the developed and developing worlds will be migrating to this new data center model and ibm is very well positioned our technology leadership ibms leadership position in it infrastructure is underpinned by a superior technology base in  for the th consecutive year ibm was issued more us patents  than any other company and our offerings in the year ahead look especially promising major ibm product launches will include our nextgeneration system z mainframe system p servers which bring power innovation to the entry level and powerbased virtualization offerings which improve energy and space efficiency for unix customers we are also introducing a new bladecenter offering and a highly innovative storage architecture thanks to our acquisition of xiv finally we expect to see continued strong growth in strategic middleware fueled by organic investment and strategic software acquisitionssuch as filenet and cognos which have augmented our information on demand capabilities  our delivery of unique client value as we head into uncertain economic times in some parts of the world one fact remains constant businesses continue to invest in it it saves them money and manages businesscritical needssuch as enterprise security realtime analytics risk management business intelligence business optimization and transformation as well as how a company expands its client base in order to gain share companies are seeking to identify and classify security risks and protect their data from all forms of attack they face regulatory demands and pressure to increase productivity without buying more stuff they need to use both structured and unstructured datasuch as the information contained in memos reports and phone callsto generate reports to their customers in minutes not days in addition we are seeing multiple areas of investment growth within particular industries for example telecommunications companies continue to upgrade their infrastructure to broadband also utilities face outdated systems the transformation from analog to digital and new regulatory requirements across the world businesses and institutions are continuing to make investments that save them money preserve capital and address issues they simply may not defer  our financial strength and flexibility as ive described our focus on highervalue offerings helps drive profitable growth and strong cash generation which have enabled ibm to return value to shareholders and to invest opportunistically for growth we also possess the financial capacity to adjust to changes in nearterm business conditions thanks to a business model in which about  percent of the companys revenues are recurring streamsfar less subject to volatility in uncertain economic conditions we believe these differentiating capabilitiesour global presence and integration preeminence in the data center technology leadership and the ability to deliver measurable client valuewill be drivers of profitable growth in both good times and bad as a result we believe that ibm has excellent opportunities in  and beyondin an environment that presents significant challenges for our competitors they are not as global as strong in highgrowth segments or as able to deliver complete solutions nor do many have the experience and discipline to adjust their economic models as conditions require so we will pursue growth while at the same time remaining prudent and disciplined about expenses and productivity that is we will operate ambidextrouslyseizing the new opportunities that the external marketplace presents while never ceasing to reexamine our own operations or to transform our organization this is difficult not every workforce has the focus and maturity to do it but ibm has been here before and we know what to do historically this is when we have gone on offense at the opening of this letter i said that we intend to capitalize on our strengths in order to seize the growth profit and leadership opportunities presented by todays global marketplace let me close with some thoughts on what will be required of any company seeking to do that on the prospects for continued global growth when people look out at the global economy today some are concerned about ripple effects they fear the impact on overall growtheven in the developing worldof a possible downturn in parts of the developed world now im not an economist but let me offer a perspective based on my experiences as i visit ibms clients and our own operations around the world you only have to get outside of the united states to see that something very new is happening today the worlds growth markets are no longer as dependent on importexport on the exchange of raw materials for industrial goods instead they are innovating they are differentiating most importantly their people are becoming consumers theyre joining the middle class hundreds of millions of people are opening their first bank accounts getting their first cell phones using their first credit cards tens of millions are buying their first automobiles these are historic developments and are pretty far removed from economic fluctuations in the united states europe and japan and consider what has to happen to give all of those people cell phones financial services and cars infrastructure has to be built and developed and not only the it infrastructure i discussed earlier but business infrastructurefor banking manufacturing telecommunications transportation and government servicesyour company knows a thing or two about how to build both kinds of infrastructure to support the way the world works weve been doing that for nearly  years however our ability to focus on markets that are small today but with great upside potential was inhibited in the past by our own organizational structure when you group such smaller markets with big ones they tend to be overshadowed and to lack proper management attention investment skills and support that is the reason we are creating a new growth markets organization to be headquartered in shanghai its goal is to accelerate ibms global growth significantly i believe this is the best way to ensure that these markets get the talent investment and attention they deserve and need in order to keep growing on local engagement to be truly global today a company has to do a lot more than set up sales offices or research facilities in multiple markets or send its people on international assignments doing business in the developing world is about relationships not just transactions you have to engage at the level of culture as well as process you have to build trust you have to be integrated on the ground working shouldertoshoulder with local suppliers governments and communities and understanding their point of view on business and innovation you have to help them advance their agendas not just your own and you have to train your leaders everywhere to be global leaders this takes time you cant leapfrog into being a global company youve got to be committed for the long term and you have to invest on multiple levels ibm has some unique historical organizational and skill advantages herebut they will only remain advantages to the extent that we continue to make them real every day in ibmers actions behavior and relationships as global professionals and global citizens on developing global professionals and citizens of all the issues facing business and society with regard to global integration perhaps the most challenging is this how does the individual compete and win in a global economy this is on the one hand what makes globalization such an emotional and polarizing issue to many people but it also opens up some of the most promising opportunities for organizational innovation in business todaydriven by the need to help our people succeed in this new environment last year we introduced the ibm global citizens portfolio it aims to provide our employees with the tools they need to enhance their expertise in a global context those tools include a matching fund to support the ibmers own learning and explorationeven if not related to his or her current job we are helping retiring ibmers to transition to second careers in teaching government service and nongovernmental organizations and weve established a program called the corporate service corps in which teams of highpotential ibmers from around the worldour leaders of the futurewill come together for onemonth projects on economic development environmental and other problems in developing countries the underlying idea here is that individuals are in the best position to make decisions about their own work learning and careers this shift of control and decisionmaking to the ibmer represents a very new relationship between enterprises and individualsand that involves a certain degree of risk sharing power always does but if you trust your strategy your capabilities and your people and if you are confident that all are grounded in a set of shared valuesthen this is the kind of innovation you pursue its one more example of playing offense in a very new game im deeply gratified that our employees reaction to the global citizens portfolio has been so enthusiastic we are for instance oversubscribed by thousands of applicants for the corporate service corps ibmers have a very mature understanding of todays new environment they know the world is changing they dont expect or in many cases even wantwhat business used to provide what they do want is an opportunity and some help to learn and grow so they can effectively compete on a world stage this is probably the single strongest reason for my confidence in ibms future as we enter a new era of technology business and global society i am proud of the worldwide ibm team for bringing us to this point and i am grateful to you our shareholders for your support in our journey i hope and trust that you are pleased with how your company is growing and evolving my colleagues and i are excited by the possibilities for how we together with our clients our partners and you can bring this remarkable enterprise into its next era of leadership and discovery,10.42,1.0
91,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2008,dear ibm investor as i write to you the global economy is experiencing profound disruption there is a great deal of understandable and appropriate anxiety about where we are headed in the near and medium term many approaches are being offered to stimulate economic recovery and growth and it is clear that ibms industry as well as many others will look very different a few years from now you need to know in this time of turmoil that your company is well positioned to continue delivering strong results as we have been doing and did again in  achieving record revenue record pretax earnings record earnings per share and record free cash flow even more importantly we are also positioned to lead in the new era that lies on the other side of the present crisis in this letter i will explain why i will describe how this moment of historic change presents an opportunity for ibm not only to assert leadership in our industry but to play a central role in changing how the world literally works our confidence is grounded in the strategic transformation of ibm over the past several years and the focused execution of nearly  dedicated and innovative women and men around the world ibm is now a very different company than it was just a few years ago as a result we entered this turbulent period strong and we expect to exit it stronger a new eraand a new ibm what explains our strong performance when so many of our competitors and other companies across business are struggling during a deep economic slowdown the answer lies at the beginning of this decade when the it industry and businesses everywhere were confronted by three fundamental shifts in the world  the reality of global integration i dont mean simply the widely shared recognition that the world was becoming flat but the way in which that was happening and what it meant for the goals and the very forms of organizations the lowering of trade barriers the rise of the developing world and the emergence of the world wide web combined to unleash the flow of work on a truly global scale therefore the key questions facing leaders of all kinds became how will we get that work to flow to us how will we differentiate ourselves in a global economy and how will we capture the new growth opportunities that are emerging around the world increasingly new business modelsin fact a new model of the corporation itselfbegan to take shape at ibm we called it the globally integrated enterprise  the emergence of a new computing model this new model which was replacing the pcbased clientserver approach was networked modular and open just as important it was no longer confined to it systems alone increasingly the digital infrastructure of the world was merging with the physical infrastructure of the world and that was creating a new platform for the global economy and society we are now living in a world that is  instrumented computational power is being put into things no one would recognize as computers phones cameras cars appliances roadways power lines clothesand even natural systems such as livestock and rivers  interconnected all of this is being connected through the internet which has come of age  intelligent we now have the computing power advanced analytics and new computing models such as cloud to make sense of the worlds digital knowledge and pulse and to turn mountains of data into intelligence  innovation and integration because of this new global arena and new technology model business leaders expanded their horizonsdriven both by competitive pressures and the remarkable array of new capabilities no longer content with cost savings from offtheshelf technologies and solutions they were seeking to innovateand not just in their products and services but also their business processes management systems policies and core business models to accomplish that they sought to integrate advanced technology far deeper into their operationsat ibm we saw that these shifts would reshape the economic technological and competitive landscape and open up enormous business opportunity so we made some important decisions and we got to work global integration we made major investments in our teams and capabilities in emerging markets around the world this is helping us achieve superior growth in emerging markets not only in the socalled bric countries of brazil russia india and china but in dozens of countries across the developing world at the same time we accelerated the global integration of ibms operations as a result our supply chain research labs software development and service delivery today are truly global in scope we have made substantial progress toward remaking ibm into a globally integrated enterprise with more still to do technology we transformed ibms mix of products services skills and technologies exiting commoditizing businesses like pcs and hard disk drives and making more than  strategic acquisitions this decade we also shifted our internal rd of the more than  us patents ibm received in  our th straight year of patent leadership more than  percent were for software and services ibms portfolio today is built around networked modularized and embedded technologies such as serviceoriented architecture soa virtualization business intelligence and analytics as a result we are well positioned to build the kinds of it infrastructures and solutions that will be of the highest value to our clients business the kind of value our clients sought required a partner with intimate knowledge of their industry and with the ability to turn that knowledge into companyspecific operational and management systems you cant do that on a global scale from corporate headquarters so we not only amassed considerable industry expertise but also made major changes in how we deploy it we shifted skills and decisionmaking closer to the marketplace and the client at the same time we transformed our vast services delivery capability we applied automation standardization and the kinds of engineering and management principles that were long ago adopted in manufacturing and supply chains the results are showing up in our margins and in our bestinclass levels of service delivery client satisfaction we enter this period strong put it all together ibm today is a very different company which is evident in our results since the dotcom crash in  we have more than doubled our pretax income and free cash flow and more than tripled our earnings per share our standout  continued this record of superior performance revenue and income our revenue was a record  billion up  percent in  we grew pretax income from continuing operations by  percent to  billion the highest ever margins ibms gross profit margin rose for the fifth consecutive yearto  percent up  points since  our pretax income margin rose to  percent both margins are at their highest in more than a decade we achieved this by driving productivity and continuing to shift our business mix to more profitable segments more than  percent of our segment profit in  was from software services and financing earnings per share we have continued to achieve strong eps growth last year was another record with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of  up  percent this marked six straight years of doubledigit eps growth cash flow ibm has consistently generated strong cash flow in  our free cash flow excluding the yeartoyear change in global financing receivables was  billion an increase of  billion from  our business model has allowed us to generate more than  billion in free cash flow over the past nine years ibm ended  with  billion of cash and marketable securities investment and return to shareholders our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business and to generate substantial returns to investors our  cash investment was  billion for  acquisitions of them in key areas of software and after investing  billion in rd and  billion in net capital expenditures we were able to return more than  billion to you billion through share repurchase and  billion through dividends last years dividend increase was  percent marking the th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend in this environment clients immediate needs are very clear to save money preserve capital and reduce costs we help them do that and our ability to deliver that kind of value is why they are continuing to choose ibm its why our services business achieved its highest margin in the past five years its why our software business continues to grow so robustlywith pretax profit doubling over the past five years to  billion in  and its why we continue to enjoy strength in highutilization highperformance infrastructure in sum with our excellent financial position strong balance sheet solid recurring revenue strong profit streams and unmatched global reach we are confident about  and are ahead of pace to achieve our  objective of  to  in earnings per share the information on pages generating higher value at ibmwill help explain why a smarter planet the coming era will not be kind to enterprises or institutions that have failed to step up to unresolved issues in their core models strategies or operations in our view this is not simply a cyclical downturn but a major shift in the global economy and societyone that is simple to state but profound in its implications in the last two decades we have seen our planet become smaller and flatter in the next two we will see it become smarter this isnt a metaphor and im not talking about the knowledge economyor even the fact that hundreds of millions of people from developing nations are gaining the education and skills to enter the global workforce i mean the infusion of intelligence into the way the world actually works the systems and processes that enable physical goods to be developed manufactured bought and sold services to be delivered everything from people and money to oil water and electrons to move and billions of people to work and live through pervasive instrumentation and interconnection almost anythingany person any object any process or any service for any organization large or smallcan become digitally aware networked and intelligent this means that industries infrastructures processes and entire societies can be more productive efficient and responsive and problems that have heretofore been insoluble can now be tackled problems like wasting too much energy like spending too much time in traffic like producing food too expensively and wasting too much of what we produce like missing too many sales opportunities and disappointing too many customers because of inefficient supply chains like making too many medical errors and spending too much to deliver healthcare to too few and most obviously of late like failing to manage financial riskthese and other systems by which the world works are increasingly unsustainable they may be networked but it turns out that being connected isnt enough it doesnt make them smart but the good news is they can be we know this because ibm is building these systems today in collaboration with forwardthinking clients around the world in them we can see a foreshadowing of how banking will work how telecommunications will work how energy healthcare transportation and retail will work we can see a world that is becoming smarter before our eyes smarter traffic stockholms intelligent traffic system created by ibm has resulted in  percent less gridlock a percent drop in emissions and a reported  additional daily users of public transport ibm is building smart traffic systems in cities from london to brisbane to singaporewith many more being planned smarter power grids ibm today is leading seven of the worlds top ten automated meter management projects our intelligent utility network with centerpoint energy enables remote sensing and operation of the electric grid connection and disconnection of service fewer and shorter outages improved customer service and the integration of new environmentally friendly power sources such as wind and solar as well as the charging of plugin electric vehicles in malta we will build the worlds first national smart grid which will also instrument and monitor the countrys water systems smarter healthcare the cost of therapy is being lowered by as much as  percent for example ibm technology is being used to monitor the proper delivery of injections and vaccines to more than  million patients in  states and partnering with google and the continua health alliance we have introduced software that will enable data from personal medical devices to feed a patients electronic health record smarter food systems ibm built a system for norways largest food supplier that uses rfid technology to trace meat and poultry from the farm through the supply chain all the way to supermarket shelves smarter money foreign currency exchange is the worlds largest single market thanks to a smart financial system ibm developed intraday settlement risk for more than  trillion in daily volumemore than  percent of the worlds foreign exchange transactionshas been effectively eliminated and through technologyenabled microfinance organizations like grameen foundation and financial information network and operations ltd fino are providing poor people around the world with collateralfree loans and financial services to support incomegenerating businesses smarter telecommunications ibm is helping traditional telecom service providers mobile and broadband operators and broadcasters transform their networks and services ibms solutions are being used in india to deliver new services dynamically to support  million mobile phone subscribersmore than half of the total indian market for mobile servicessmarter water we can even use computer modeling to simulate monitorand potentially managethe behavior of river basins around the world as water for tomorrow a collaboration between ibm and the nature conservancy is now doing in brazil china and the us in every one of these examplesand there are many morewe see improved productivity efficiency responsiveness profitability and societal benefit with so much technology and networking abundantly available at such low cost what service wouldnt you provide a customer citizen student or patient what wouldnt you connect what information wouldnt you mine for insight the answer is youor your competitor will do all of that you will do it because you can because the technology is both available and affordable and governments and societies around the world will do it because they must as i talk to leaders everywhere from business government and across civil society i am hearing the same urgency for action the same need for significant investment and the same focus on not simply repairing whats broken but preparing for a new economy in a new century in particular there is widespread and growing recognition of the importance of smart infrastructure our conversations around the world are giving us confidence that ibm is well positioned to address societys and businesses most urgent needs we will be aggressive in our pursuit of this opportunity indeed you will be hearing and seeing much more about our smarter planet vision in the weeks and months ahead as we establish our point of view build the right relationships and offer smart solutions in the marketplace we will emerge stronger in closing i think its worthwhile to step back and consider this moment and our response to it in a broader context many companies are reacting to the current global downturn by drastically curtailing spending and investment even in areas that are important to their future we are taking a different approach of course we must continue to improve our competitiveness but while we maintain discipline and prudence in the near term we also maintain the discipline to plan for the future were not looking back were looking ahead were continuing to invest in rd in strategic acquisitions in growth initiatives and most importantly during these difficult times in our people in other words we will not simply ride out the storm rather we will take a longterm view and go on offense throughout our history during periods of disruption and global change this is what ibm has done again and again we have played a leadership role we have imagined what the world might be and actually built it we find ourselves at such a moment now this is an inflection pointboth in the course of modern technology and economic history and in the nearly year journey of ibm as someone who has been here for more than a third of that journey i can tell you that it presents the best opportunity i have seen in my ibm career to align those two trajectories in very powerful ways from cabinet rooms to board rooms to kitchen tables around the world people are eager for change such a mandate doesnt come around very oftenperhaps once in a generation or once in a century its not something to squander i and my fellow ibmers have no intention of doing so let me close by expressing my pride in the worldwide ibm team for bringing us to this point and my gratitude to you our shareholders for your unwavering support i hope that you are pleased with how your company is performing and evolving and i trust that you share our excitement about the role we can play in what promises to be a new era for o,12.33,1.0
92,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2009,dear ibm investor when i wrote to you a year ago the global economy was experiencing profound disruption the financial system was freezing up many companies and entire industries were pulling in their horns hoping simply to ride out the storm ibms own industry was no different nonetheless i said that we felt confident heading into  we were entering the year strong and we expected to exit it stronger a year later despite an environment that remains very challenging i am happy to report that your company has continued to outperform our industry and the market at large we delivered strong results in  once again achieving record pretax earnings record earnings per share and record free cash flowdespite reduced revenues at the same time we continued to deliver superior returns to you our owners most importantly we are well positioned to grow as the economy begins to recoverthe explanation for this performanceand for our optimism about both the nearterm and the longerterm futureis threefold it rests first on the ongoing transformation of our company second on our focused strategy to capture the large opportunity of a globally integrating world and third on a business model that reliably generates strong profits and cash giving us the financial flexibility to invest for future growth i will talk about each of these factors in detail in this letter it is important for you to understand the ways in which ibm today is a very different company than it was just a few years ago this repositioning explains why we have demonstrated such stability and strong results during this downturn and why we believe we will benefit as the economy recovers and growth returns a strong year capping a strong decade two thousand nine was a tough year by any measure but ibms performance was indicative both of our highvalue market position and of the discipline we apply to our strategy and operations since the dotcom crash in  we have added  billion to ibms pretax profit base increased our pretax margin  times quadrupled our earnings per share and more than doubled our free cash flow cumulatively we have generated about  billion of free cash flow our strong  continued this record of superior performance margins ibms gross profit margin rose for the sixth consecutive yearto  percent up  points since  our pretax income margin rose to  percent both margins are at their highest in more than a decadewe achieved this by driving productivity and continuing to shift our business mix to more profitable segments once again more than  percent of our segment profit in  was from software services and financing earnings per share we have continued to achieve strong eps growth last year was another record with diluted earnings per share of  up  percent this marked seven straight years in which we have grown eps by double digits cash flow ibm has consistently generated strong cash flow a key indicator of real business performance in  our free cash flow excluding the yeartoyear change in global financing receivables was  billion an increase of  million from  ibm ended  with  billion of cash and marketable securities revenue and income our revenue was  billion down  percent at constant currency nonetheless in  we grew pretax income from continuing operations by  percent to  billion our highest everinvestment and return to shareholders our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business and to generate substantial returns to investors our  cash investment was  billion for six acquisitionsfive of them in key areas of software and after investing  billion in rd and  billion in net capital expenditures we were able to return more than  billion to you billion through share repurchase and  billion through dividends last years dividend increase was  percent marking the th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend in sum with our excellent financial position strong balance sheet solid recurring revenue strong profit streams and unmatched global reach we are confident about the year ahead and beyond indeed we achieved our  objective of  to  in earnings per share one year early we believe that we will again grow eps by double digits this year reaching at least  the information on pages  through  a decade of generating higher value at ibm summarizes the story of our transformation and describes the opportunities it has opened up for growth in the coming era leading our industry and the market as we enter a new decade its interesting to reflect upon how the last one began the conventional wisdom back then was that the robust it growth of the gogo s would continueand even after the dotcom bust most believed it would resume it was thought that buyers of it would continue to selfintegratewhich would mean that our industry would remain highly disaggregatedand that clientserver computing would become the predominant enterprise model it wasnt unreasonable to hold these views however as we looked out we saw a different picturean undercurrent of fundamental change as we worked to understand the deeper meaning of events to separate the cyclical from the secular and to apply lessons from our own past we came to believe that major shifts were underway that would reshape our industry and indeed the global economy  changes in the world the lowering of trade barriers the rise of the developing world and the emergence of the world wide web were unleashing the flow of work on a global scale we believed these changes were powerful and irreversible and that they would lead to new business models and a new form of the corporation itselfwhat we came to call the globally integrated enterprise  changes in technology at the same time a new model of computing was replacing the pcbased clientserver approach computational capability was being put into things no one would recognize as computers phones cameras cars appliances roadways power lines clothesand even natural systems such as agriculture and rivers all of this was being connected through the internet and we now had the computing power advanced analytics and new models now known as clouds to turn mountains of data into insight as a result the economic societal and physical systems of the world were becoming instrumented interconnected and intelligent our planet was becoming smarter  changes in client demand compelled by the new opportunities and competitive demands of these first two shifts enterprises and institutions were no longer content with cost savings from offtheshelf technologies and solutions they now sought to innovatenot just in their products and services but also their business processes management systems policies and core business models to accomplish that they needed to integrate advanced technology far deeper into their operations because we believed that these shifts would change our industry creating winners and losers we made some important decisions and got to work we transformed ibms mix of products services skills and technologiesexiting commoditizing businesses like pcs and hard disk drives and making  strategic acquisitions over the course of the decade we amassed substantial industry expertise and also reinvented the way we deploy it shifting skills and decision making closer to the marketplace and the client we invested significantly more in our teams and capabilities in emerging markets around the world and we accelerated the global integration of ibms operations at the same time we transformed our vast services delivery capability applying automation standardization and advanced engineering and management principles of the sort that prior generations had applied to manufacturing we also rebalanced our internal rd today ibms portfolio is built around networked modularized and embedded technologies such as serviceoriented architecture soa business intelligence and analytics of the more than  us patents ibm received in  our th straight year of patent leadership and a record for any company more than  percent were for software and services thats how the last decade played outfor our industry and for your company the landscape for growth today many of our competitors are emulating our moves for instance several have gone on an acquisition binge to get into new spaces however there is a vast difference between what your company has doneamassing truly differentiating technology and skills and focusing on the needs of enterprise clients and what others are doing largely to compensate for rapidly commoditizing business modelsas the new decade begins some in our industry still seem to believe that history will repeat itself for example that clients will invest in it simply because of product upgrade cycles once again we have a different view we believe that clients will only invest in what delivers compelling quantifiable business value we believe that the fundamental shifts i described earlier will continue to play out and that they create a unique opportunity for ibm and because of the way we have managed the company during the economic downturn we have the flexibility to take advantage of this opportunity and to invest for growth our investments in  are focused on four highpotential opportunities growth markets ibm has among the broadest global footprints of any corporation or institution we serve clients in more than  countries around the world and we have been deeply established within myriad local economies and cultures for decades our growth markets unit established in  is helping to capture the highestgrowth opportunities of the worlds emerging economies since  these markets have expanded their contribution to ibms geographic revenue by a point a year growing at least  points faster than major markets over the last three years going forward both mature and emerging markets are building out and integrating their physical and digital infrastructures and infusing the resulting systems with intelligence more than  trillion in fiscal stimulus has already been earmarked by governments around the world we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these large business and technology opportunities and we are pursuing them aggressively in   analytics data is being captured today as never before both from the socalled internet of things heading toward trillions of connected objects and from hundreds of millions of individuals using social media in just three years ip traffic is expected to total more than half a zettabyte thats a trillion gigabytes or  followed by  zeroes and this data no longer consists merely of text and numbers it includes rich media of all kinds from video and audio to images avatars simulations and applications thirty percent of the data in the world today consists of medical images alone all this informationthe knowledge of the world the flow of markets the pulse of societies can now be turned into insight through sophisticated mathematical models also known as analytics where once we inferred now we know where once we interpolated and extrapolated now we can determine the historical is giving way to the realtime and even the predictive ibm is moving quickly to capitalize on this promise we have built the industrys premier analytics practice with  consultants mathematicians and researchers as well as leadingedge software capabilitiesbolstered by key acquisitions such as cognos and spss our new business analytics and optimization service line targets the highestgrowth opportunities by delivering integrated analytics solutions based on the needs of specific industries  cloud and nextgeneration data center as our planet becomes instrumented interconnected and intelligent the computing model is evolving to support it think of it as the industrialization of it over the past generation our digital infrastructures have become very complex and inefficient so now were optimizing them through automation creating systems that are highly tuned to the specific workloads they run and to new consumption and delivery models such as clouds thus the data center is shifting from being a single physical place to something more like the internet a diverse set of services fueled by it this provides far more choice and flexibility of particular interest to the many businesses and governments that want simply to consume some services they once built maintained and provided themselves it also makes possible things that were not previously so such as modeling systemic risk or creating integrated healthcare records however with these new possibilities come new challenges in areas such as security as a result our clients are seeking help in architecting and building a new kind of highly efficient infrastructure that is reliable and secure even as it integrates services from a variety of external sources we have invested billions of dollars in rd and acquisitions to build leadership in two key dimensions of this new it model service management software and optimized systems we have also established a portfolio of cloud services that clients can access externally from ibm or offer internally to users on their own premises and because of ibms track record of integrating new technology paradigms like open source and the internet into the enterprise we have earned the trust of clients and the industry to bring reliability and security to what is new  smarter planet all of these growth strategies come together in the opportunity we call smarter planet this is not a metaphor it describes the infusion of intelligence into the way the world actually works the way that almost anything any person any object any process or any service for any organization large or small can now become digitally aware networked and intelligent this means that industries infrastructures processes cities and entire societies can be more productive efficient and responsive we developed this agenda and strategic initiative in the summer of  and we launched it that autumnat the peak of the economic crisis we did so because we believed it represented a pragmatic way to address the very problems that were transfixing the world after just a year it is clear that our belief was correct the idea of smarter systems is resonating with decisionmakers in both the private and public sectors we are seeing these systems being implemented in every major industry and across every region of both the developed and developing worlds and they are creating measurable economic and societal value  in a study of  cities those that employ smarter transportation solutionsincluding ramp metering signal coordination and incident managementreduced travel delays on average by more than  hours annually  eight hospitals and  primary care clinics in spain implemented smarter healthcare systems across their facilities and improved clinical results and operational efficiency by up to  percent  banks and other financial services organizations around the world are achieving new levels of risk control efficiency and customer service for instance payment processing costs at the bank of russia have been reduced by  percent and cls bank now handles most of the worlds currency exchange transactions securely eliminating the risk from trades worth  trillion per day and growing  four leading retailers have reduced supply chain costs by up to  percent reduced inventory levels by up to  percent and increased sales up to  percent theyve done so by analyzing customer buying behaviors aligning merchandising assortments with demand and building endtoend visibility across their entire supply chain this list could go on we are quantifying the outcomes of hundreds and hundreds of smarter systems and this measurable value gives leaders everywhere the confidence to try something new so the questions we are hearing are no longer about whether a smarter planet is a real possibility now there is an enormous hunger to learn how ceos cios governors and mayors are asking questions like how do i infuse intelligence into a system for which no one enterprise or agency is responsible how do i bring all the necessary constituents together how do i make the case for budget how do i coalesce support with citizens where should i start in  we are focusing our efforts on helping clients answer those questions in nine highgrowth industries healthcare oil and gas energy and utilities transportation telecommunications retail banking government and electronics at the same time we are continuing to push the scientific frontiers at the core of smarter technologies today more than  percent of ibm researchs work is on smarter planet projects and we are in the process of doubling that to more than  percent in areas such as mobile web nanotechnology stream computing analytics and cloud seizing the opportunity before us the opportunity to make our planet smarter is both real and inspiring it has excited forwardthinking leaders in industry government and across civil society in both mature and growth markets encouragingly but not surprisingly it has also energized ibmers over nearly a century ibms greatest achievements have arisen from our distinctive culture and values this is why despite the current economic climate i am optimistic about ibms prospects to lead the era we are now entering underneath the surface turmoil this moment presents a rich and transformational opportunity everywhere around the world people are eager for change and every day more and more forwardthinking leaders are creating tangible outcomes and benefits making their parts of our planet smarter like ibmers they recognize that we cannot wait cannot let this moment pass they know the time to act is now and the way to act is together let me close by expressing my pride in the  women and men of the global ibm team who have brought us to this point and let me express my gratitude to you our shareholders for your unwavering support i hope that you are pleased with how your company is performing and evolving and i trust that you share our excitement about the role we can play in what promises to be a new epoch for our industry for business and for our planet,13.42,1.0

received in  once again a record for any company and our th straight year of patent leadership more than  percent were for software and services a road map to the future ibm today is a fundamentally different company in order to make that clear to our investors and to the financial markets we decided four years ago to introduce our  road map we wanted to explain where we were going and to provide benchmarks for you to evaluate us along the way we believed and still believethat this longerterm framework is the most helpful way to understand our company to some it seemed foolhardy to my knowledge no company in our industry had done this before but we felt ibm should take a longterm view in public as well as in private and we felt confident about the future because of the transformational steps we had taken to reposition the company clearly this worked as you know we surpassed our  goal of  to  in earnings per share and now that we have shown we can deliver results with consistency we are doing it again through the introduction last year of our  road map as before our new road map isnt just a list of targets its a management model organized around the major drivers of ibms earnings per share performance those are operating leverage share repurchase and growth strategies operating leverage will come from our continuing shift to highermargin businesses and our improving enterprise productivity we are aiming for  billion of productivity improvement over the next five years part of that will go to our bottom line and part will go to investments that improve our competitiveness in the marketplace secondly we will continue returning value to you our road map calls for  billion in anticipated share repurchases and  billion in dividends when it comes to the third component of our road map we will focus on four growth priorities  growth markets a historic economic expansion is underway in the emerging markets of the worldas their populations join the middle class and their economies join the global marketplace these markets are expected to achieve average gdp growth of  percent through  more than double the projected growth rate of the developed world in the largest of these emerging markets such as china india and brazil ibm is broadening its wellestablished base of skills and capabilities nearly doubling our number of branch locations in less developed markets such as africa we are leveraging anchor clients in sectors like communications and banking our recent partnership with bharti airtel to provide st century wireless telecommunications across  countries of subsaharan africa is one example our growth markets unit accounted for  percent of ibms geographic revenue in  we are aiming to approach  percent by  business analytics and optimization the research firm idc predicts that global data volumes will increase by  times over the next  yearsto  zettabytes a zettabyte is a  followed by  zeros enterprises need a way to manage and mine this deluge of potentially valuable information and the key is advanced data analytics ibm spotted this emerging need early building the worlds leading analytics practice with  expert consultants the worlds premier nonacademic mathematics function leadingedge software and offerings integrated by industry we have received more than  analytics patents and have made acquisitions to deepen our capabilities under our  road map analytics is expected to grow to  billion in revenue by   cloud and smarter computing as the world becomes more instrumented and interconnected businesses and institutions need smarter it infrastructures to handle dramatic increases in data volumes and to improve data center efficiency we are creating new ways to design computer systemsoptimized for specific workloadsand new ways to deliver itinfused services ibm has helped thousands of clients adopt aspects of cloud delivery where it resources are virtualized highly automated and accessed by selfservice we are assisting clients in areas as diverse as banking healthcare and government to build their own clouds or to tap securely into ibm cloudbased business and infrastructure services our road map calls for  billion in revenue from cloud by   smarter planet put it all together and you have what we mean by building a smarter planet in  and  we articulated a point of view on ways the world can become smarter and in  we deployed significant resources to capture the opportunity in key highgrowth industriessuch as healthcare retail banking and telecommunicationswhere our experience and solution delivery is strongest we also expanded our smarter cities initiative our road map calls for smarter planet solutions to grow to  billion in revenue by  by becoming a very different company from what we were just a few years ago we have become much more like the company ibm has been for most of its history in sum our superior strategic positioning strong balance sheet solid recurring revenue robust profit streams and unmatched global reach give us confidence that we will be able to continue achieving the same kinds of results in the next five years that we have achieved during the past decade over the last  years we have nearly tripled our eps added  billion in free cash flow returned  billion to you tripled our software profits and increased the share of our revenue from growth markets from  to  percent excluding divested pcs and printers over the next five years we expect to grow our operating nongaap earnings to at least  per share to generate another  billion in free cash flow to return an additional  billion to you to grow our software profit to about half of total segment profit and to increase growth markets contribution to our revenue to nearly  percent the information on pages  to generating higher value at ibmsummarizes our road maps places them in the context of ibms  years of growth and describes our opportunities in the coming era a new century of progress let me close with a few words on reaching the extraordinary milestone of  years which we will mark on june  of this year throughout this time spanning many eras of technology markets global economics politics and cultureand across multiple managements strategies innovations products and services within ibm itself our company has consistently done three things first we have foreseen the opportunities of our times and made markets in them these have included the automation of modern retail banking and air travel the creation of populationscale systems such as us social security and the farther reaches of scientific progress from the exploration of space to the frontiers of genomics bioinformatics and nanotechnology today it encompasses the even broader range of work we describe as building a smarter planetoptimizing the enormously complex systems that enable services to be delivered physical goods to be developed manufactured bought and sold everything from people and money to oil water and electrons to move and billions of people to work and live second we have created the tools to do that ambitious work and to capture its economic opportunity in the early decades of ibms life this involved clocks scales and punched card tabulators it changed fundamentally with the dawn of the computer age as ibm created many of its technological breakthroughs from the relational database to the disk drive dram fortran the mainframe the pc and much more we built the worlds most productive industrial laboratoryhome to five nobel prize winners and generator of more us patents than any other company in the world and it continues today with breakthroughs such as watson the computer that recently defeated the two alltime champions on the television quiz show jeopardy! watsons vast analytic capacity represents a new stage in computings ability to tackle the worlds most pressing needs where and when they really emergein the natural language of healthcare banking government retail and morefinally we have consistently built an organization that can sustainably deliver that kind of value this is nontrivial over the past century many enterprises institutions and governments have come and gone ibms longevity rests on our founders success in shaping a particular kind of organization it was a company that mastered the creation of economic value from knowledge and information that was truly globalwhatever that meant for each era and that pioneered a new kind of relationship with society most importantly ibms leaders believed that a great company could only survive decades of change through the intentional creation of a vibrant culture one grounded in shared beliefs and values and they and subsequent generations of ibmers actually built it that is the legacy of ibms first century and it continues to shape our company today it is no accident that our growth strategies like smarter planet and growth markets are aimed at the most promising business and societal opportunities of our era nor is it surprising that we are pushing the frontiers of science and technology to achieve those ambitious goalsfrom analytics to cloud to new workloadspecific computing models it is also consistent with our dna that we have paid equal attention to the continual reinvention of ibm itselfmost importantly reexamining and applying our core values to how we run the company in a fundamental sense by becoming a very different company from what we were just a few years ago we have become much more like the company ibm has been for most of its history as we start our second century thats a good place to be let me close by expressing my pride in the worldwide ibm team for bringing us to this point and my

currency operating earnings per share were up  percent putting us well on track to our  road map objective of at least  of operating earnings per share importantly we continued to deliver value to you our owners this performance is a testament to our strategic position and capabilities the discipline of our management systems and the dedication and expertise of more than  ibmers around the world importantly it reflects the impact of a distinct choice we have made about ibms business and technology model ibm is an innovation company both in what we do and in how we do it we pursue continuous transformation always remixing to higher value in our portfolio and skills in the capabilities we deliver to our clients and in our own operations and management practices this is not the only path to success in our industry and it is not the easiest one but it is ours in this letter i will report on our  results and then put them in context of our model of continuous transformation results in

an industry characterized by a relentless cycle of innovation and commoditization one model for success is that of the commodity playerwinning through low price efficiency and economies of scale ours is a different choice the path of innovation reinvention and shift to higher value we remix to higher valuewe do so in our portfolio in our organic rd investment and through targeted acquisitions and divestitures  we remix our research and development two decades ago  percent of our researchers were working in materials science hardware and related technology even the oneinten working in software were focused on operating systems and compilerstoday  percent are in fields that support our key growth initiatives such as the  mathematicians developing algorithms for business analytics as well as a diverse group of specialists that include medical doctors computational biologists experts in natural language processing and weather and climate forecasters since the beginning of  we have spent  billion on rd and in  ibm earned the most us patents for the th straight year with a record total of   we acquire new capabilities organizations run into trouble when they look to fulfill a new strategy or provide the basis for transformation through acquisitions we practice a disciplined approach that asks three questions does it build on or extend a capability ibm already has does the company have scalable intellectual property can it take advantage of our reach into  countries our balanced formula has built a strong track record since  with more than  acquisitions  we divest nonstrategic assets always moving to the future isnt just about what you invent it also involves choices about when to move on over the past decade we have divested almost  billion of annual revenue businesses that no longer fit our strategy if we had not done so we would be a larger company today but with lower margins and capabilities less essential to our clientswe make markets we create new markets by category by geography and by client  we make markets by category our software and services businesses today look very different from just a few years ago offering new solution categories like mobilefirst social business and smarter commerce in our hardware business momentum is building for our new puresystems family which launched the new category of workloadoptimized systems puresystems has seen more than  installations in more than  countries in just two quarters  we make markets by geography we are achieving strong results in the worlds growth markets working closely with businesses institutions and governments as they seek to modernize their infrastructures and societies we opened  new branches in these markets in  we also continue remixing to more profitable opportunities in these countries through smarter planet solutions such as smarter transportation smarter finance and smarter cities we make markets by client we unlock new opportunity within our existing client base by creating capabilities for a new generation of it buyersfrom chief marketing officer to chief financial officer to the head of human resources and more i discuss this in greater depth below we reinvent core franchises our system z enterprise server introduced in  is just the latest reinvention of the mainframe and it drove system zs largest capacity shipment ever during the fourth quarter with more than half of that growth coming from linux workloads core software platforms such as websphere have been entirely transformed and information technology services which was once a significant reseller of others technologygenerating good revenue but low margins has shifted significantly to highvalue services such as data center energy efficiency security and business continuity and recovery this has contributed to a point pretax income margin improvement in services since  we remix our skills and expertise an innovation model means continuously remixing and deepening our expertise for example over the past three years we have increased our skill base in analytics by more than  experts we have also added nearly  sellers in key areas of industry expertise such as healthcare energy telecom and banking as well as emerging sectors such as metals and mining this year ibm global business services and ibm research will launch the ibm client experience lab as well as joint gbs and software practices in social business and mobility including a tripling of our skill base in social and mobile technologies and doubling our skill base in smarter commerce we reinvent the enterprise itselfwe have been highly disciplined about driving productivitythrough the adoption of common shared operations and systems the streamlining of enterprisewide processes and the leveraging of global skillsall in the service of global integration and we are now taking the next step becoming a smarter enterprise  in part this means applying analytics to every part of our businesschanging how we manage risk drive efficiency increase marketing effectiveness and infuse business insight across the company  in part it means using social technologies to identify ibm experts and enable them to deliver their knowledge and leverage our entire portfolio to create a seamless highvalue client experience this ongoing transformation gives us confidence that we will achieve our goal of  billion in productivity savings over the course of our  road map sixty percent of our productivity savings are reinvested in the business we use our strong cash flow strategically our cash flow generation fuels reinvestment in the business in rd capital expenditures and acquisitions at the same time we deliver consistently strong returns to you our ownersa new era of computing to sustain an innovation model in our industry a company must do more than accommodate major technology shifts it must lead them ibm has done this repeatedly over the past centurynot only pioneering new technology models but capturing significant economic value today another new wave is sweeping inpowered by big data analytics mobile social and cloud we anticipated this several years ago with our point of view on building a smarter planeta world that was becoming instrumented interconnected and intelligent now the it environment is moving from monolithic applications to dynamic services from structured data at rest to unstructured data in motion from pcs to unprecedented numbers and kinds of devices from stable to unpredictable workloads from static infrastructure to cloud services and from proprietary standards to open innovation this shift plays strongly to ibms historic position in enterprise computing so we are as we have so often done in the past reshaping our investment innovation and market strategies to lead we see three defining characteristics of this new era what we call smarter computing  smarter computing is designed for big data every two days as much data is now generated as in all of human history up to  this is big data and it constitutes a vast new natural resource that can revolutionize industries and societies with the right technology capable of analyzing and extracting value and insight from it this is one reason ibms analytics business is growing so strongly as we work with clients to drive intelligence into every aspect of their operations indeed we have raised our  road map target for business analytics from  billion to  billion of revenue we are also rapidly advancing the marketplace applications for our breakthrough cognitive computing system watson which is already demonstrating its potential to transform healthcare and finance we will introduce our first commercial watson offerings this year to sustain an innovation model in our industry a company must do more than accommodate major technology shifts  smarter computing is built on softwaredefined environments to handle todays volume velocity and variety of data enterprise data centers must become more dynamic and flexible one way to think about this is to imagine entire it infrastructures that are as programmable as individual systems this new model is known as the softwaredefined environment and cloud computing is its first manifestation however it will not be the last this new model optimizes the entire computing stackcompute storage and network resourcesso that it can adapt to the type of work required hardware built for these new environments will be of significant business value exemplified by ibms systems today from system z to power systems to storage to our new puresystems family ibm systems are softwaredefined  smarter computing is open only through open standards and platforms can enterprises support an expanding universe of heterogeneous data devices and services and engage in todays rich innovation ecosystems the challenge is how to turn open approaches into successful business ibm helped do so with linux eclipse and apache supporting their growth into standards with vital industry ecosystems and then developing highvalue ibm business on top of them today we are repeating this strategy through a number of collaborations such as openstack a new open source cloud platform hadoop an open source platform for big data and several promising open source hardware projects taken together computing that is open softwaredefined and designed for big data constitutes a profound shift in information technology and as in prior such shifts it will create new markets and new clients we are pursuing them aggressively new clients new markets as i mentioned to capture the opportunities opened up by this new era of technology ibm is engaging with new kinds of clients as we make new markets in big dataanalytics cloud for the enterprise emerging economies and smarter planet indeed from a business perspective smarter planet is a platform for a growing array of new marketssuch as smarter commerce smarter cities and social business and these new markets take concrete shape through the engagement and enablement of a new generation of it clients today we are working around the world and across multiple industries with many new leaders perhaps the most active among them in embracing the new era of technology have been chief marketing officers who are looking to reinvent the practice of marketing for example by understanding and enabling customers as individuals rather than segments this helped our global business services smarter commerce signings grow by nearly  percent in reaching  billion at the same time chief procurement officers are expected to increase their annual investment in supplier intelligence by  percent through  as they reshape their global supply chains and leaders of human resources are investing in analytics to build smarter workforces and social enterprises one analyst has ranked ibm as number one in enterprise social business for the past three years frontoffice transformation has the potential to fuel the biggest wave of business technology investment since the era of enterprise resource planning city mayors are deploying intelligent operations centers to transform public services in davao philippines rio de janeiro brazil and miamidade county florida and urban transportation managers such as those in singapore and eindhoven netherlands are reducing urban congestion by offering drivers alternate route recommendations in exchange for their cars data on braking acceleration and location this list could go on frontoffice transformation has the potential to fuel the biggest wave of business technology investment since the era of enterprise resource planning erp and that creates a powerful set of conditions for the tens of thousands of business advisors and industry experts embedded in the worlds greatest engine of technical innovation in sum our strong strategic positioning solid balance sheet recurring revenue robust profit streams global reach and especially our institutional capacity for innovation and continuous transformationgive us confidence that we will continue to provide differentiating value to our clients employees partners and communitiesand therefore to you our owners generating higher value at ibm pp  summarizes how on being essential in closing let me say a few words on the deeper meaning of this model of continuous transformation to higher value at this particular moment in history as i have noted an innovation model does not present an easy path especially in an industry as fastchanging as ours but once you are clear on your choice it shapes everything you do your business strategy how you recruit talent how you develop skills how you invent how you run the company and for ibm it means something more it speaks to ibmers aspiration to be essential to each of our vital constituencies our clients our communities our partners our investors and one another we see this as our purpose as an enterprise to serve their plans for success their need to transform and their own unique sense of purpose the era opening before us offers a historic opportunity for both businesses and societies to pursue this higher purpose a vast new natural resource is being unleashed promising to do for our century what steam electricity and fossil fuels did for the industrial age the economic and societal potential of this new gusher of data is incalculable it is the opportunity of our lifetime and ibmers are determined to seize it it is in this spirit that i express my deep pride in the worldwide ibm team for bringing us to where we are and my gratitude to you our shareholders for your unwavering support i hope you share our excitement about your companys performance and the way in which ibmers are building a smarter planet and a brighter future,16.6,1.0
96,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2013,dear ibm investor what will we make of this momentas businesses as individuals as societies what will we make with a planet generating unprecedented amounts of data what will we create fromand withglobal networks of consumers workers citizens students patients how will we make use of powerful business and technology services available on demand how will we engage with an emerging global culture defined not by age or geography but by people determined to change the practices of business and society to capture the potential of this moment ibm is executing a bold agenda it is reshaping your company and we believe it will reshape our industry in this letter i will describe the actions we have taken and are taking and the changed company that is emerging from this transformation i believe that if you understand our strategy you will share our confidence in ibms prospectsfor the near term for this decade and beyond lets start with the phenomenon of our agedataa planet of data today every discussion about changes in technology business and society must begin with data in its exponentially increasing volume velocity and variety data is becoming a new natural resource it promises to be for the st century what steam power was for the th electricity for the th and hydrocarbons for the th this is what we mean by enterprises institutions and our planet becoming smarter thanks to a proliferation of devices and the infusion of technology into all things and processes the world is generating more than  billion gigabytes of data every day and  percent of it is unstructuredeverything from images video and audio to social media and a blizzard of impulses from embedded sensors and distributed devices this is the driver of ibms first strategic imperative to make markets by transforming industries and professions with data the market for data and analytics is estimated at  billion by  to capture this growth potential we have built the worlds broadest and deepest capabilities in big data and analyticsboth technology and expertise we have invested more than  billion including  billion of gross spend on more than  acquisitions we have  consultants and  mathematicians twothirds of ibm researchs work is now devoted to data analytics and cognitive computing ibm has earned  analytics patents we have an ecosystem of  industry partners and  university partnerships around the world developing new analyticsrelated curricula ibm provides the full array of capabilities our clients need to extract the value of big data they can mine multiple structured and unstructured data sets across their business they can apply a range of analyticsfrom descriptive to predictive to prescriptive and importantly they can capture the time value of data this matters because the battle for competitive advantage in this new world can be lost or won in fractions of a second our data and analytics portfolio today is the deepest in the industry it includes decision management content analytics planning and forecasting discovery and exploration business intelligence predictive analytics data and content management stream computing data warehousing information integration and governance this portfolio provides the basis for the next major era in computingcognitive systems traditional computing systems which only do what they are programmed to do simply cannot keep up with big data in constant motion for that we need a new paradigm these new systems are not programmed rather they learn from the vast quantities of information they ingest from their own experiences and from their interactions with people ibm launched this era three years ago when our watson system defeated the two alltime champions on the quiz show jeopardy! watson has since matured from a research grand challenge into a multifaceted business platform enabled globally via the cloud earlier this year we launched the ibm watson group it will comprise  professionals a  billion investment and an ecosystem of partners and developers that we expect to scale rapidly in the process we believe watson will change the nature of computing as it is already beginning to change the practice of healthcare retail travel banking and more taken together our investments in data and analytics are driving significant growth with  service engagements to date growing by double digits in  our business analytics revenue rose  percentled by global business services and software this is already a nearly  billion business for us and we have raised our expectations for it an it industry remade by cloud at the same time that industries and professions are being remade by data the information technology infrastructure of the world is being transformed by the emergence of cloud computingthat is the delivery of it and business processes as digital services it is estimated that by  more than onefourth of the worlds applications will be available in the cloud and  percent of new software is now being built for cloud this is driving ibms second strategic imperative to remake enterprise it infrastructure for the era of cloud as important as cloud is its economic significance is often misunderstood that lies less in the technology which is relatively straightforward than in the new business models cloud will enable for enterprises and institutions this is creating a market that is expected to reach  billion by  ibm today is the leader in enterprise cloud a position we have enhanced through investments of  billion on  acquisitions most notably softlayer in  we provide the full spectrum of cloud delivery modelsinfrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service and business process as a service ibms cloud capabilities are built on  cloud patents and supported by thousands of cloud experts eighty percent of fortune  companies use ibms cloud capabilities our cloud foundation at the infrastructure level is softlayer the markets premier public and private cloud environment with bare metal dedicated servers that provide unmatched compute power deployed in real time with hundreds of configuration options our public cloud processes  million client transactions every day in terms of technology security flexibility and pricing ibm surpasses all our major competitors and our rapidly growing roster of  client engagementsincluding companies like honda sun life stadium us open tennis and hundreds of top online games with a user base exceeding  millionis a testament to that these companies and a growing number of others understand that their customerfacing applicationswhich they deploy on public clouds for reasons of cost accessibility and speedmust be integrated with their core enterprise systemssuch as finance inventory manufacturing and human resources this is why one analyst predicts that by  nearly  percent of large enterprises will use hybrid cloud environments that are part public part private and integrated with backend systems it is also why a new class of cloud middleware services is emerging to manage these complex environments last month we announced several capabilities that will connect enterprise data and applications to the cloud ibms entire enterprise software portfolio is becoming available to developers in an open composable business environment to build applications with flexibility and scalability a cloud first approach is being implemented in ibm software development labs globally for lineofbusiness users looking to drive innovationincluding heads of finance marketing human resources procurement and other functionswe offer an unmatched array of more than  softwareasaservice saas offerings ibms saas offerings today support  of the top  companies in the fortune  going forward companies will continue to unlock the value of these business applications for example nearly  percent of organizations are currently using or planning to use composable business services finally enterprises will wantand needto manage their data in the cloud with the same rigor as if it were onpremises companies will do this in order to ensure auditability visibility change control access control and data loss protection indeed data management will arguably be the single most important design point for enterprise cloud environments driven not only by security and cost but also by regulation to meet growing demand for greater speed and legal requirements for compliance and data residency ibm is aggressively expanding its global cloud footprint we currently have  data centers globally and the new  billion investment announced in january will see the opening of  more in the us the uk australia brazil canada china france germany india japan and mexico the impact of our cloud investments shows up clearly in our results ibms cloud business grew  percent in  delivering  billion of revenue as we actively embrace cloud in order to deliver ibm as a service to our clients we expect to see significant benefits in client experience revenue growth and enterprise productivity engagement in a world of empowered individuals the phenomena of data and cloud are changing the arena of global business and society at the same time proliferating mobile technology and the spread of social business are empowering people with knowledge enriching them through networks and changing their expectations this leads to ibms third strategic imperative to enable systems of engagement for enterprises complementing traditional backoffice systems of record enterprises are now taking a systematic approach to engagement with all of their constituenciescustomers employees partners investors and citizens indeed  percent of companies now expect to devote more than a quarter of their it spending to these new systems of engagement by  nearly twice the level of  months ago they are doing so because the way their customers and their own workers expect to engage is undergoing profound change seventy percent of people who contact a company via social media today expect a response within five minutes nearly  percent of adult smartphone users keep their phones with them an average of  hours a day this is why we launched ibm mobilefirst in  and why we have made eight acquisitions to advance our mobile initiatives we have  mobile experts and have been awarded hundreds of patents in mobile and wireless technologies when these individuals use their mobile devices to engage with a company they expect personalized service indeed  percent of people are willing to trade their information for a customized offering the good news is that this is increasingly possible thanks to social business and data analytics but its not that simple one only needs to follow the news to see rapidly rising concerns legitimate concernsabout data security and institutional trust twothirds of us adults say they would not return to a business that lost their confidential information and the economic stakes are enormous one analyst estimates that by  there could be an additional  trillion of growth in global online retailif the industry can enhance trust we have strengthened our already clear leadership in enterpriseclass social business and in security our acquisitions in social include kenexa which helps companies use behavioral science not just to connect with people but to understand and build lasting engagement with them and we have made a dozen acquisitions in security building a capability of more than  security experts  patents and  labs worldwide finally ibm is leading by example in building modern enterprise systems of engagement and learning our social platform connections has  ibm users and  communities there are more than  ibmers active on client collaboration hubs for our top  accounts last year hundreds of thousands of ibmers worldwide shaped the practices that define how we work and they are enhancing their skills daily through a massive open online learning system called think academy in  we achieved yearoveryear growth of  percent in mobile  percent in security and  percent in social business our performance in  you can learn more about the ibm strategy on pp  this is the context in terms of which to understand our performance in  by many measures it was a successful year for ibm our diluted operating earnings per share in  were  a new record this marked  straight years of operating eps growth we grew operating net income by  percent to  billion in  we invested  billion for  acquisitions we invested  billion in net capital expenditures we invested  billion in rd while earning the most us patents for the st straight year while making all these investments in ibms future capabilities we were able to return  billion to you in approximately  billion through gross share repurchases and  billion through dividends last years dividend increase was  percent marking the th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend and the th consecutive year in which we have paid one however we must acknowledge that while  was an important year of transformation our performance did not meet our expectations our operating pretax income was down  percent our revenue in  at  billion was down  percent as reported and  percent at constant currency so while we continue to remix to higher value we must also address those parts of our business that are holding us back we have two specific challenges and we are taking steps to address both the first involves shifting the ibm hardware business for new realities and opportunities we are accelerating the move of our systems product portfolioin particular power and storageto growth opportunities and to linux following the lead of our successful mainframe business the modern demands of big data cloud and mobile require enterprisestrength computing and no other company can match ibms ongoing capabilities and commitment to developing those essential technologies we also announced in january an agreement to sell much of our intelbased x server business to lenovo this divestiture is consistent with our continuing strategy of exiting lowermargin businesses such as pcs harddisk drives and retail store solutions but let me be clearwe are not exiting hardware ibm will remain a leader in highperformance and highend systems storage and cognitive computing and we will continue to invest in rd for advanced semiconductor technology the second challenge involves the worlds growth markets while ibms growth in latin america and middle east and africa was strong enterprise spending slowed in other key growth markets we are intensifying focus on new growth opportunities overall the opportunity in the worlds growth markets remains attractive on being essential as we have learned throughout our history the key to success is getting the big things right innovating and investing accordingly and challenging our organization operations and especially our culture to adapt when you do all those things you do more than stay abreast of change you lead it you invent entirely new capabilities such as cognitive computing and watson you translate these innovations into sustainable economic valuesuch as building cloud infrastructure that is enterpriseclass and societally robust and you make yourself a laboratory for the futureof work of engagement of the modern enterprise the progress we are making on these strategic imperatives is highly encouraging no company in our industry is positioned as strongly as yearold ibm for the world now taking shape we are confident in our vision our strategy and our prospects every generation of ibmers has the opportunityand i believe the responsibilityto invent a new ibm this is our time we are working to make this not just a successful business but an essential institution for our clients and the world in a new era i am deeply proud of the global ibm team for bringing us here and i am grateful to you our shareholders for your unwavering support i hope you share our excitement about your companys path and the shared opportunity we have together to build a brighter future on a smarter planet ,16.48,0.0
97,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2014,dear ibm investor the cover of our report to you last year asked what will we make of this moment this was the critical and urgent decision that weand our clientsfaced would we seize upon the major shifts that are reordering our industry and opening up vast new applications of information technology in my letter i described our answer  ibm would help transform industries and professions with data  we would remake enterprise it for the era of cloud  we would reimagine work by helping clients build systems of engagement underpinned by the imperative of security at the same time we would address significant challenges in some of our businesses principally hardware we knew we faced a critical year of transformation it proved to be just that the work of transforming ibm continues and much remains to be done but i am pleased to report that we made significant progress and built momentum in  in this letter i will describe what we have done and continue to do to transform and differentiate your company and to position ourselves for leadership in the new era now taking shape continuing to move to higher value information technology is one of the most dynamic fastchanging and fiercely competitive industries in the world characterized by relentless cycles of innovation and commoditization our choice is clear we pursue a model of highvalue innovation rather than commodity technology products and services our commitment to this model compels us to reinvent businesses continually grow new ones organically and through acquisitions and occasionally divest businesses that do not fit our profile you see all of this reflected in our  resultsa dynamic shift of our portfolio underneath our  billion in revenue  billion in operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of  from continuing operations consider that we completed or announced the divestiture of three businesses in  that a year earlier drove  billion in revenue but lost about  million in profit what i call empty calories at the same time we are making significant investments in line with the strategy i described to you last year throughout the year you saw the bold moves we made   billion to accelerate the commercialization of ibm watson bringing cognitive computing to more clients and partners in more industries   billion to expand our softlayer cloud centers around the world we expect to have  locations by the end of    billion to create ibm bluemix our cloud platformasaservice for software developers  further scaling our global ibm cloud business through partnerships with sap and tencentibm watson analytics offering powerful cognitive and visually intuitive analytics in the palm of your hand  a landmark partnership with apple to bring mobility to the enterprise and reimagine the work of professionals  a strategic alliance with twitter to bring an entire new category of big data to business these investments will contribute to the strong growth we are seeing in our strategic imperatives which deliver high value and now represent a significant part of ibm together cloud analytics mobile social and security generated  billion of revenue in  growing by  percent five years ago these businesses represented just  percent of our revenue today that has risen to  percent of ibms revenue big data and analytics our analytics business grew  percent to  billion in  we are driving growth by helping our clients integrate all data sourcesstructured and unstructuredand apply a range of analytics descriptive predictive and prescriptive we combine this capability with deep knowledge of industries and professions our analytics portfolio draws upon more than  acquisitions and includes nine analytics solutions centers with an ecosystem of more than  business partners further we are creating the next stage of big data and analytics with cognitive computing cloud our cloud business is growing rapidlyup  percent to  billion in  with asaservice at  billion up nearly  percent and exiting the year with a run rate of  billion ibm cloud is set apart by focusing on hybrid environments optimized for data and security shaped by our knowledge of the requirements of enterprise clients for example the planetwide footprint of cloud centers that we are building will provide clients the combination of global and localized data access and security that they need this is unmatched in the industry engagement underpinned by security in mobile our growth more than tripled in  going forward we expect this to benefit from the apps from our strategic alliance with apple and our global network of digital design studios further ibm is the global leader in enterprise security grounded not only in technology and our  patents but in our experiencebased understanding of the changing nature of the challenge enterprises and institutions discover that they cannot wall out attackers twentyfirst century security is a big data problem which is why our security business with unequalled data and analytics capability grew  percent in  at the same time that we have been growing new businesses we have been reinventing our core franchises last year we promised to address challenges in our systems and technology business we did so in  with hardware going from losses in the first half to nearly  million of profit in the fourth quarter alone that is a remarkable swing in transforming this business we took several important actions  we sold our x server business and announced the divestiture of our commercial semiconductor technology business  we committed  billion over the next five years to the development of nextgeneration semiconductor technologieswe introduced major technological advances with power and software defined storagebuilt for cloud and big data  in january  we launched our new z mainframe built for the mobile era it processes massive volumes of transactions while tapping backoffice data and simultaneously applying realtime analytics for deeper insights and fraud detection  historically we kept our industryleading power technology all to ourselves today we see greater value by enabling an openpower ecosystem which allows partners to innovate and build on the power technology launched in  the openpower foundation began with five members and now stands at more than  around the world the us department of energy recently awarded ibm a longterm  million contract to create future supercomputers based on openpower technology all of this speaks to the enduring quality of ibm as a highvalue innovation company last year we again spent about  percent of our revenue on research and development and the ratio within our software business is double that we invested  billion on capital expenditures ibmers are prolific innovators for the nd straight year we earned the most us patents of any organization averaging  a day  our transformation continues our direction is clear we remain confident in our strategy and we have made much progress in  we will build on our momentum  we will shift an additional  billion of spending to data cloud and engagement this year aimed at deepening our differentiation in the marketplace in february we introduced innovations to make hybrid cloud a reality for the enterprise we are also growing our portfolio of industryspecific analytics solutions in areas ranging from counterfraud and oil and gas exploration to airline maintenance and the internet of things and we began the year by establishing a number of business units focused on markets and industries being transformed by our strategic imperatives ibm commerce ibm analytics ibm security and ibm cloud we have announced plans for an ibm healthcare unit  we will continue to bring innovation to our core franchises innovation highly valued by our clients i previously mentioned the entirely refreshed line of mainframes ibm power systems and storage we will continue to apply breakthroughs from ibm research to our products and services in software we will accelerate our march to asaservice in services we will deploy advanced automation to delivery and we will continue helping new and existing outsourcing clients transform their infrastructure and processes by leveraging ibms hybrid cloud platform this was an important differentiator in helping us to sign nearly  contracts worth greater than  million in  and to maintain a services backlog of  billion these core franchises also provide the foundation for future innovation and growth one example is our partnership with apple together we are placing powerful analytics capabilities in the hands of professionals these apps are integrated with critical business systems work flows and data sets thats what enables an airline attendant to rebook a flight while en route a financial advisor to model a portfolio in the clients living room an instore sales assistant to act as a trusted fashion advisor or an emergency responder to have realtime situationrisk awareness including live video  we believe open ecosystems and partnerships are key to our future innovation this is a significant new element of our growth strategy we will add to and scale partnerships with companies like apple twitter sap tencent and now softbank also the ibm watson ecosystem is rapidly expanding with  companies in the pipeline together these actions will make ibm an even highervalue business we expect our strategic imperatives of cloud analytics mobile social and security to continue growing by double digits and to become a greater percentage of ibm we will remain the enterprise leader in these markets finally we will continue to return substantial value to you our owners through dividends and gross share repurchases last year these were  billion and  billion respectively in  we marked our th consecutive year of raising our dividend and our th year of paying onean essential company so i come back to this moment full of rapid change but even more opportunity  and to ibms unique purpose as an enterprise ibm lives at the intersection of technology and business this enables us to change the way the world works and in so doing to be essential to our clients and to society we work with  percent of the worlds top banks  of the top  oil and gas companies  of the top  retailers and  of the top  healthcare organizations ibm systems manage banking reservations transportation retail trading and healthcare systems our mainframes alone process  percent of the worlds business data today we are building upon this foundation to create an entirely new generation of critical systems ibms clients are unclogging city traffi c exploring a cure for cancer improving the safety of food supplies reducing risk and serving their own customers employees citizens and patients with greater levels of understanding personalization and intimacy a new world is taking shape before our eyes remade by data rewritten in code and growing smarter every day this is the work that energizes me and all of my fellow ibmers i am deeply grateful to the ibm team for bringing us here and to you our shareholders for your support i hope you share our excitement about your companys path and the shared opportunity we have together to do something that is truly essential ,12.02,0.0
98,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2015, ibm is unique it is the only company in our industry that has reinvented itself through multiple technology eras and economic cycles we do so for one reason to create differentiating value for our clients and for you our owners we are doing so again in an it industry that is fundamentally reordering at an unprecedented pacein important ways our industry is unrecognizable from what it looked like just a few years ago so is your company today ibm is much more than a hardware software services company ibm is now emerging as a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company in this years report i will share my perspective on what this means to you andto our clients around the world i will discuss our results from  and what we expectto achieve this year and beyond although more must be done and the work of transformation is never complete i believe we have reached a turning point in our journey the progress of our transformation two years ago we laid out our strategic planto transform ibm in order to ensure that we meet the changing needs of our clients and capture the highestvalue opportunities for our investors as part of this we divested commoditizing businesses that provided diminishing valueto our clients and contributed revenue but little or no profit we restructured other businesses of which hardware was the largestbusinesses vital to our future but in need of reinventionat the same time we dramatically accelerated the growth of our strategic imperativesdata and analytics cloud mobile social and securityto help our clients become digital then last year we launched integrated units to make it easier and quicker to put together solutions drawn from our expanding digital portfolio further accelerating growth and enhancing client experience we shifted more than  billion of investment to add fuel to our strategic imperatives and in  these businesses delivered solid growth contributing  percent of ibms total revenue up signifi cantly from  percent two years ago now in  we have reached a new stage in our transformation as importantas becoming digital is to our clients ithas become clear that it is not the destination rather digital business is converging witha new kind of digital intelligencewhat you will recognize as watson we call this cognitive business in october we launched a global conversation about this new era of business and technology cognitive business simultaneously speaks to clients about the coming era and explains the ibm that is now emerging let me describe it in greater depth our solutions are cognitive data is the worlds new natural resource and it is transforming all industries and professions ibm has been building and acquiring the capabilities necessary to lead in data and analytics deepening our industry expertise and growing partnerships and ecosystems today our data and analytics business is the industry leader generating revenue of  billion in  this is a strong and growing business but its potential is actually much greaterthat potential lies in the  percent of the worlds data that is unstructured everything we encode in languagefrom textbooksand formulas to literature and conversation plus all digital video audio and images this unstructured data has been essentially invisible to computers they can capture store and process it but they cannot understand what it means but with cognitive technology we can now probe this dark data cognitive systems can ingest it all and they can understand its meaning through sensing and interaction they can reason about it generating hypotheses arguments and recommendations and unlike any computing system we have known they are not programmed rather they learnfrom training by experts and from their own experience in fact they never stop learning cognitive includesbut is broader than artificial intelligence machine learning and natural language processing and its embodimentis watson watson has come a long way since it wonon the american quiz show jeopardy! in  back then it did one thing natural language qa powered by five technologies today qa is just one of more than  watson capabilities all of which have been turned into digital services or application programming interfaces apis delivered via the cloud this means that we can literally build cognition into everything digital with watson every digital application product and process can understand reason and learn you can see why cognitive is becoming the heart of our solutions businesses what started as one watson unit is now a growing familythe core watson team which continues to build new capabilities and nurture its expanding ecosystem and individual watson businesses aimed at particular industries or professional domains such as ibm watson health andibm watson internet of things each business brings together watson capabilities with industry expertise vast data sets and an ecosystemof partners and clients and each is poweredby the ibm cloud in ibm watson health for example our partners include medtronic memorial sloan kettering cancer center the new york genome center and cvs health we have enhancedour capabilities in healthcare with expertise and data sets acquired through population health management leader phytel health data analytics provider explorys and medical images firm merge healthcare in february  we announced our intention to acquire truven health analytics a leading provider of cloud based healthcare data analytics and insights and watson is being trained by the worlds leading practitioners and researchers in multiple fields of life sciences medicine and healthcare because these ibm watson units will befed by an enormous new volume and variety of data we have moved aggressively to expand our clients access to it through partnerships with companies such as twitter and box and our acquisition of assets from the weather company ibm watson today is a rapidly expanding business with clients in  countries including leaders and startups in healthcare financial services retail energy automotive government and more and we continue to grow watsons capabilitiesfor example giving it the capacity

builders and cloud is the platform on which they are building all of our ibm watson units along with the rest of our growing portfolio of cognitive solutions are being built on a cloud platform the word platform is important much more than simply a faster and cheaper wayto access it a cloud platform is a new modelof innovation manufacturing and distribution cloud platforms provide an open environment for collaboration and rapid scaling they expose growing libraries of apis from which partners and third parties across a broad ecosystem can create new innovative solutions and cloud offers access to multiple data sets and relevant expertisenot only about technology but also from business and societal domains the ibm cloud is designed for this new era it is the overall platform on which we our clients and our ecosystem partners are building a rapidly expanding array of solutionsit encompasses multiple technology and data platforms  ibmbluemixourplatformasaservicefor developers

this business grew by double digits in  the weather company is not just a source of enormously valuable weather data it isa platform and it forms the heart of our new ibm watson internet of things solutions unit today the platform can analyze data from  billion weather forecast reference points including satellites weather stations air planes consumer apps and more it handles  billion inquiries to its cloudbased services each day in the united states alone making it the countrys fourth most popular app going forward we will apply this powerful platform to collect integrate and analyze data

like weather video is one of the richest and fastestgrowing data sources expected to comprise  percent of internet traffic by  the market for cloudbased video services analytics and software is estimated to be more than  billion by  and we are now positioned for strong growth there  finallywatsonitselfisacloudplatform supporting a growing ecosystem more than  developers are using watson apis and more than  startups and businesses in the watson ecosystem are building applications and solutions powered by watson importantly the future of cloud is hybrid spanning public cloud private cloud and the integration software systems and services needed to bring these environments together securely and seamlessly as enterprises move to the cloud hybrid is not a transition phase it is the destination indeed it is the fastestgrowing segmentof the cloud market and ibm is the global leader in hybrid cloud for the enterprise in this our incumbency is a significant advantagefrom processing and protecting nearly threefourths of the worlds transactions on the ibm main frame to designing and running core banking systems supply chains reservation and retail systems and more for example we are bringing our large base of clients in ibm global technology services gts to the cloud last year of our more than  services deals greater than  million seven out of  featured hybrid cloud we have also brought all of ibms relevant middleware into ibm cloud our middlewareis the worlds leading it integration platform with one analyst firm naming us the middleware leader for the past  years and middleware will be the heart of hybrid ibm websphere for example unlocks all data and applications for the cloud it enables clients existing apps to access the cloud and new born on the cloud applications to access existing assets a final reason we will remain the global leader in enterprise cloud is that clouds future depends on infrastructure innovation this is why the full spectrum of ibm systems remains critical in this new era we continue to design develop and deliver leadingedge servers storage and software built for a hybrid cloud world for instance our mainframe reinvented for mobile transactions serves as an advanced analytics accelerator and securityrich enterprise cloud server and our power platform is being used to deliver cognitive workloads through the rapidly growing openpower ecosystem anda vibrant linux community cognitive and cloudmany in our industry see these as two separate phenomena we see them differently as two sides of the same coin two dimensions of a single model cognitiveis the only way to ingest and extract value from the new natural resource of data in all its forms so that it can be turned into competitive advantage and societal value and cloud is the platform on which these solutions are designed built tested and deployed in the world  performance the impact of our transformation is clear in our  results our strategic imperativesanalytics cloud mobile social and securitygrew by  percent and generated  billion last year as i mention ed that represented  percent of ibms total revenue at year end adjusted for the impact of currency and divestitures as are all revenue resultsreported in this letter analytics revenue grew  percent for the year to  billion mobile more than tripled for the second straight year security grew  percent and social was up percent not only did total cloud revenue increase by more than  percent to  billion making ours the largest cloud business in the world but our clouddelivered asaservice revenue continued to grow reaching  billion in  with a yearend annual run rate of  billioneven as we fueled these highgrowth businesses we continued to bring innovation to the businesses our clients have long valued and relied on ibm global technology services whichis increasingly injecting automation and cognition into our services delivery grew both revenue and signings finishing with a growing backlog we have also grown in the partsof ibm global business services gbs where we have transitioned to our highgrowth strategic imperatives with nearly half of our gbs revenue now coming from those busi nesses in december we announced that our partnership with apple had delivered more than  ibm mobilefirst for ios applications helping to transform the way work gets done acrossindustriesandprofessions our systems hardware business hada strong year since the launch of the zin the first quarter of  we have delivered mainframe growth of  percent with strong doubledigit gains every quarter power revenue grew  percent in  and has grown forfour straight quarters on the strength of openpower and linux on power the strong performance of our systems hardware business over the past two yearsswinging from a yeartoyear decline in profit of  billion in  to reporting profit growth of nearly  million last yearis largely the result of the significant business restructuring wehave implemented for the full year we generated revenueof  billion down  percent we achieved operating earnings per share of  and delivered operating net income of  billion the progress of our transformationin particular our growth in hardware and gts shows what ibmers can do to reinventour core businesses in  we will focus on  oursoftwarebusinesseswherewewill accelerate our shift to cognitive solution based opportunities and help ourclients make the transition to asaservice models delivered via hybrid cloud  gbswherewewillusecognitivetodifferen tiate and drive our consulting business modernize gbss core business with digital value propositions and grow margin through continued focus on highvalue markets and improved productivity  storagewherewewillaccelerateour shift to object storage and strengthen our leadership in flash our model is based on strong generationof free cash flow which we maintained with  billion in  we use our cash to invest in the future and to return value to you our owners in  we invested more than  percent of our revenue in rd and about  billion in capital expenditures we announced  acquisitions and for the rd consecutive year ibm led in us patents earned once again breakingthe  threshold even more important than the total number is the transformation those patents represent consider that when our streak began more than two decades ago  percent of our patents were in hardware last yearnot only did we earn seven times as many total patents but  percent of them were in cloud analytics and cognitive we also returned  billion to you in  including dividends of nearly  billion and  billion in gross share repurchases this marks the th consecutive year of an increased dividend and ibms th straight year of providing one the emerging ibm because ibm uniquely transforms both tech nology and business our own reinventionsin response to changing eras have been far reaching this is evident again today as you have seen we have transformed our portfolio shedding businesses that provided little differ entiating value to our clients shifting our rd and making dozens of acquisitions to fuel our growth businesses at the same time we have also injected new thinking and talent into ibms culturesuch as training  ibmers in agile methods and increasing our team of professional designers to more than  embedded with clients and in  design studios around the world both client satisfaction and employee engagement are on the rise our experience over multiple eras of techno logical change has also taught us the importance of understanding its implications for the global economy for society and for how all of us work and live today some have expressed concerns about the impact of intelligent systems onjobs and the future of work these are legitimate questions which must be addressed in a thoughtful manner across business government and civil society at ibm our experience with cognitive systems undertaking the deep science learning what cognitive systems actually do and working every day to apply these capabilities in the worldhas taught us that cognitive technology does not replace but rather enhances human capabilities instead of artificial intelligence the realworld work of cognitive business is intelligence augmentation and its benefits for the human condition will be extraordinary in the end the most important challenges we face are not about technology but about values whether the question is civil liberties and national security or privacy and conven ience or some professions rising while others decline our path to this enormously hopeful future will depend on the creation of mutual value transparency and above all trust for ibm  was a pivotal year in our journey to this new era providing strong confirmationof the strategic direction of our transformation we know who we are we know why our clients seek to work with us we know why you choose to invest with us we also know why brilliant experts professionals and innovators seek to become and remain ibmers together we understand that we are at a turning point in ibm historyand in the history of technology we are committed to doing what every prior generation of ibmers has donetransforming ourselvesto lead in a new era of business and technology in order to remain essential to our clients andto the world my colleagues and i are excited and confident about the cognitive future and we are working hard with our clients partnersand peers to build it i am proud of the ibm team for bringing us here and i am grateful to you our shareholders for your steadfast support ,13.19,1.0
99,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2016,it can be hard to assess the progress of a major transformation from a single years results and yet when you look back after a few years it becomes clear just how much has changed before i offer a broader perspective let me describe how your company performed in  we made substantial progress last year  we achieved operating earnings per share of  and free cash flow of  billion  we invested heavily for our longterm competitivenessnearly  billion in research and development nearly  billion in capital expenditures and nearly  billion to make  acquisitions adding to our capabilities in the highgrowth areas of cognitive cloud and security  we returned  billion to you our shareholders including dividends of  billion and  billion in gross share repurchases we raised our dividend for the st consecutive yearand it was ibms st straight year of providing one we are proud of both milestones  ibms technical community outdid itself for the th year in a row ibm led in us patents earned becoming the first company to break the  mark in one year  all of this and more is due to the work and passion of  ibmers they are our greatest competitive advantage and the most important reason for confidence in ibms prospects in the years ahead this is why its so encouraging that employee engagement scores continue to rise year after year but understanding ibm at the start of  requires a longer viewin particular remembering why we embarked on this journey of transformation it had nothing to do with economic downturn or fixing something broken rather our experience over more than a century has trained us to be vigilant we began to see that the it industry would radically reorder driven by the phenomenon of data the maturation of cloud computing and the emergence of what many call artificial intelligence or ai we were convinced that the source of value for our clients and for our ownerswould shift and that the convergence of these innovations would usher in a new era in both technology and business we didnt wait we got out of commoditizing businessestrimming  billion from our top line and nothing from our bottom line over the past five years we redoubled our efforts to reinvent our core hardware software and services franchises while investing to create new onesin cloud data cognitive security and the other businesses that comprise our strategic imperatives we did this not simply to manage a portfolio of businesses but to build the integrated capability that our clients would need for the new era while our transformation continues a strong foundation is now in place our strategic imperatives have reached critical mass at  billion they now contribute  percent of ibms revenue with doubledigit growth were on pace to achieve our goal of growing these businesses to  billion by  most importantly within these businesses we have built unique and powerful platforms with watson and the ibm cloud  watson has become the ai platform for business i will have much more to say about watson but just consider that through our clients and ecosystem partners we expect watson to touch one billion people this year  ibm is now the global leader in cloud for the enterprise in  our cloud business grew an outstanding  percent to  billion adjusted for the effects of currency as are all revenue growth numbers in this letter cloud by itself is now more than  percent of our total revenues our asaservice exit run rate was  billion up  percent i am so proud of the teams who have incubated and scaled these businesses they are the ibm investors unicorns at the same time we have transformed much of ibms corethe other  percent of our company global technology services gts is the market leader in it services the next time you use your credit or debit card take out an insurance policy board a plane or drive your car chances are you are being touched by gts their services run the infrastructure that powers  percent of the banking industrys daily card transactions  percent of the automobile industrys production of passenger vehicles and nearly half of mobile connections worldwide and while our gts team is superb at managing infrastructure they are innovators at heart in recent years they have built strong capabilities in hybrid cloud and are applying automation and watson wherever and as fast as they can this unique combination of innovation and trust enables gts to grow signings and revenue and win new clients global business services continues to reinvent itself and is growing robustly where we have created new practices last year our cloud practice was up more than  percent mobile more than  percent and analytics  percent thats goodthough not enough yet to offset declines in some traditional practices such as enterprise resource planning but i remain confident in our ability to transform this business and we will continue to invest in these new areas for example we created a new watson iot internet of things consulting practice that will include  consultants data scientists and security experts when it comes to our ability to reinvent large significant businesses i must say a word about the mainframe installed mainframe capacity has increased fold in the past  yearsand is still growing as you saw in our fourthquarter  results why do clients love the mainframe because no other system can do what it can do and because our mainframe team continues to create new capabilities for new workloads our latest mainframe runs linux processes mobile payments instantly supports hybrid clouds and is becoming preferred as the most secure platform for the important new technology blockchain this is why i call this part of ibm our youngest oldest business leading a new era with watsons victory on jeopardy! in  ibm ended the latest socalled ai winter and led our industry and the world into the cognitive era today were no longer alone the land rush into ai is onincluding a lot of hype but we expect to maintain and extend our lead in cognitive business because we uniquely serve the needs of the enterprise enterprises need cognitive solutions that turn vast amounts of data into insights and competitive advantage they need access to a cloud platform not only for it capability but for speed and agility its architecture must be hybrid spanning both public and private clouds because businesses will want to leverage their existing investments in applications it infrastructure and most of all their data and they need a partner they trust who understands their industry and process flows and whose platform is secure scalable global in scope and local in presence ibm provides this powerful ai cloud platform and we are using it to build industrybased solutions to realworld problems we are creating domainspecific datasets that we either own or partner to access and were applying our deep industry expertise to build vertical solutions and to train watson in specific professional fields in short to win in the cognitive era data matters client control of their data and insights matters public hybrid and enterprisestrength cloud matters industry expertise matters trust and security matter that is what sets apart watson on the ibm cloudand why thousands of clients partners and ibm itself are building powerful solutions and businesses on it  ibm watson health leverages broad datasets including  million electronic health records  million healthcare claims records and millions of images you also need clinical data payer data and images all of which are created and owned by clients consider that an estimated  percent of the worlds data cannot be accessed by search engines we capture and integrate all this data because publicly available data alone is not sufficient for work like transforming healthcare or making advances in cancer whats more you need deep domain expertise watson healths  employees include doctors nurses health policy experts and data scientists finally we provide a quality management system that is hipaacompliant only ibm watson health offers all of this capability ibm watson iot has similar unique advantages the number of new clients and developers using our platform more than doubled last year our new global watson iot center in munich opened in  including the firstever cognitive iot collaboratories where clients and ibmers work together to drive innovation in automotive electronics manufacturing healthcare and insurance  late last year we launched watson financial services and because top industry specialists are needed to train watson in the risk management requirements of financial services we acquired promontory financial group a leader in regulatory compliance and risk management consulting ibm is changing industries around the world watson on the ibm cloud is available to more than  million consumers to answer questions find what they need online and make recommendations half a million students can choose courses and master a subject with watson which also helps teachers address each students unique learning needs ibm securitywhich monitors  billion security events a day for  clients spanning  countries launched the worlds first commercial cyber range where clients can simulate and prepare for realworld attacks and draw on the power of watson to fight cybercrime with watson buildings are reducing co emissions by  million tons a year businesses are accelerating hiring cycles by  percent and airlines are improving maintenance efficiency by  percent it is also becoming clear that as it moves to the cloud transactions must be trusted by all parties involved that is why we are building a complete blockchain platform blockchain brings together shared ledgers with smart contracts to allow the secure transfer of any assetwhether a physical asset like a shipping container a financial asset like a bond or a digital asset like musicacross any business network blockchain will do for trusted transactions what the internet did for information ibm is already working with more than  clients to pioneer blockchain for business they include clients who manage foreign exchange settlements smart contracts identity management and trade financebut the potential goes well beyond financial services for instance we are collaborating with walmart to ensure transparency in the way food is tracked transported and sold to consumers across china and the united states and everledger is using a cloudbased blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other highvalue goods as they move through the supply chain this is the real world of cognitive business unlike the ai we see in movies and pop culturewhich depict machines achieving consciousness or independent agency the true promise of this revolutionary technology comes not from replacing but from augmenting human intelligence it comes from embedding cognitive capability in the processes systems products and services that permeate business society and our daily lives new roads and new rules for a cognitive future as  begins our industry stands at an inflection point the next few years will be critical for information technology providers as businesses and institutions around the world will make key architectural decisionsabout cloud about data about ai ibm is well positioned to help clients make wise choicesand to lead our competition we take seriously our responsibility to ensure that new technology is adopted in ways that are both ethical and enduring never more essential than in times of rapid economic and societal change we will continue to engage across our industry and society and to advocate for a business and policy environment that is open inclusive global and equitable and we will do more than advocate we will innovate an example of such innovation is ibms principles for transparency and trust in the cognitive era which we issued in january of this year its main tenets  we believe ais purpose is to augment human intelligence  we will be transparent about when and where ai is being applied and about the data and training that went into its recommendations  we believe our clients data and insights are theirs  we are committed to helping students workers and citizens acquire the skills to engage safely securely and effectively with cognitive systems and to do the new kinds of work that will emerge in a cognitive economy these principles will be our touchstone for everything we do to build this new world we will practice them with our clients and we believe they can form an important foundation for business and society at large a world with watson last october ibm hosted more than  entrepreneurs innovators and other leaders from business government healthcare and civil society who are working with watson to transform their industries and sectors their work showed that watson has indeed entered the world at scale but this signature gathering did something more than showcase the reality and reach of watson it also presented a vision of the world with watson in example after example we saw a world that is healthier more secure less wasteful more productive more personalized more sustainable that is a world my colleagues and i want to live in indeed this is in the end why we are ibmersand why we remain so deeply committed to the hopeful future that is now within our grasp as ibm has done throughout its history we remain dedicated to leading the world into a more prosperous and progressive future to creating a world that is fairer more diverse more tolerant more just and to creating longterm value for you our strategy to reinvent our company is being validated by our clients around the world and has the support of our board of directors im grateful to them and to you our owners for your continued support most of all i am deeply proud of the ibm team for bringing us here and for what they do every day for our great company,11.87,0.0
100,IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2017,dear ibm investor the businesses of the world are changing the way they work we have prepared your company for this moment during the past five years propelled by our belief that the phenomenon of data would reorder technology and business we have undertaken one of the most ambitious reinventions in ibms modern history this phase is largely complete ibm is now a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company ibm now possesses capabilities that are unmatched in our industry to address our clients most pressing needs in my letter to you this year i will describe our performance in  which reflects the progress we have made in building these capabilities and i will explain why we believe this moment marks an inflection point not just for our company but for business and society at largethe substantial progress we made last year we achieved operating earnings per share of  up  percent our revenue for the year was  billion with operating pretax income of  billion in the fourth quarter we grew revenue  percent  percent adjusted for the effects of currency as are all other revenue numbers in this letter we did so in significant part because our strategic imperatives reached critical mass with revenue of  billion and growing  percent these products and services now contribute  percent of ibms revenue and we expect to achieve our goal of growing these new products and services to  billion in  watson strengthened its position as the ai platform for business we are embedding ai into more of what we offer including security the internet of things commerce and verticals such as watson health together these helped ibms cognitive solutions business generate more than  billion in revenue in  we also remained the global leader in cloud for the enterprise in  our cloud revenue grew  percent to  billion cloud by itself is now more than  percent of our total revenue our reinvented systems franchises generated strong growth mainframes enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter thanks to the launch of the new z the worlds first system that can encrypt data pervasively without requiring changes to applications and with no downtime we expect this breakthrough will drive significant expansion of the mainframes already broad market similarly we are reinventing our services business global business services saw signings growth throughout the year as clients engaged with our highvalue consulting practices in areas such as ai blockchain and digital strategy and design in addition our technology services and cloud platform team is working with clients worldwide to integrate public private and managed cloud environments through a single architecture ibm is the clear leader in quantum computing the worlds first and only prototype qubit system announced in  was a major step toward systems that can tackle problems beyond the scope of classical computation through ibm q experience the worlds first publicly available quantum computers more than  users have run more than  million quantum experiments a dozen clients including partners jpmorgan chase daimler ag samsung and jsr are now exploring practical applications on our latest commercial systems we have also achieved global leadership in blockchain by providing a permissioned and immutable shared ledger blockchain is doing for trusted transactions what the internet did for information hundreds of leading organizations already have embraced ibms blockchain platform walmart nestl dole kroger and others are applying blockchain to improve food safety early in  we announced a joint venture with maersk to apply blockchain to the complex world of international shipping we also are working with the depository trust  clearing corporation dtcc on new blockchain approaches for complex derivatives such as credit default swaps finally  saw a milestone in innovation as ibm for the th year in a row led the world in us patents earned setting a new record of  importantly nearly half of those patents were in ai cloud blockchain quantum security and other technologies that will power our portfolio for years to come we did all this while continuing to invest heavily for longterm competitiveness billion in research and development and  billion in net capital expenditures adding to the capabilities of our highgrowth strategic businesses we also returned  billion to you our owners including dividends of  billion and  billion in gross share repurchases we raised our dividend for the nd consecutive yearit was ibms nd straight year of providing one all of this is due to the creativity and passion of ibmers they are the reason we have reached an inflection point and they are our greatest competitive advantageinflection points this is not just an inflection point for ibm it is also an inflection point for our clientsthe enterprises and institutions of the world until a year or so ago you would find many who believed that digital disruption was here to stay they believed that the worlds incumbent businesses were at risk of being marginalized we had a different point of view we did not believe the platform giants alone would dominate a datacentric economyin large measure because they lack access to the most valuable sources of the worlds data the  percent that is not searchable on the web the worlds incumbent businesses and institutions own and generate this data coming from their professional expertise their industrys practices and market dynamics their processes and operations their people and cultures therefore we believe they are positioned to lead in this letter and throughout this report you will find the names of many of the worlds great enterprises and institutions this is not a coincidence it is a reflection of an important new reality the incumbents of the world understand that they can be the new disruptors and they are going on offense to seize this opportunity and to capture this moment they are doing so by becoming smarter businesses  businesses are becoming smarter by leveraging intelligent digital platforms the ibm cloud has emerged as the platform of choice for businessbuilt for all applications ready for ai and secure to the core it is the unifying platform for ibms capabilities integrated into a single architecture that spans public and private clouds through this powerful platform we are delivering to the worlds businesses a continuous stream of innovative capabilities computation and storage data and watson services iot and blockchain services and ibm q  businesses are becoming smarter by making their systems and processes intelligentwhich is why ibms services and solutions are grounded in deep knowledge of our clients industries this has made ibm the partner of choice for smarter businesses digital and cognitive transformation and it services clients include rbs autodesk and hyundai card as well as the large client bases of our strategic partners such as salesforce workday apple sap and vmware this deep industry dimension is also what has allowed us to establish successful new solutions businesses such as watson health watson iot and watson financial services  businesses are becoming smarter by embedding ai and data to change how work is done equipping themselves for an era of man  machine watson for oncology is helping doctors identify treatment options for their patients at more than  hospitals around the world including gachon university gil medical center in south korea svet zdravia in slovakia and taipei medical university in taiwan a year ago watson for oncology was trained in four types of cancer today it is trained in multidisciplinary support for  cancer types watson is helping tax preparers at hr block provide the best advice to millions of clients bankers and customer service representatives at crdit mutuel banco bradesco orange bank and other financial institutions are reinventing banking woodside energy chose watson to help it preserve the institutional knowledgeand reinvent the workof petroleum engineers you can read in this report how these and other leaders are making their companies smarter in all dimensions they are placing big bets on the future to increase their competitiveness and to reconnect with their companys true reason for beingwe also stand at an inflection point for society everywhere in the world ibm does not believe that the future belongs to the few we believe it belongs to all of usand we translate that belief into practice and policy on data and ai responsibility as the worlds new natural resource unleashed by the maturation of ai data holds the potential to generate growth prosperity and societal progress but it will only do so if the world can trust that data is being collected managed and analyzed responsibly at a time when many are questioning the power and behavior of some companies ibm is stepping forward as a responsible steward of data and ai we believe that ais purpose is to augment not replace human intelligence we are clear on the need for transparencyon where ai is used who trained it and what data sets were ingested we also believe that data and the insights it generates belong to their creators no one should have to give up ownership or control of their data to benefit from ai and cloud computing we have built and are deploying watson accordingly trust also requires the protection of data through strong encryption and security systems that are constantly tested and strengthened the privacy of data must be respected those too are core dimensions of the ibm cloud with watson on jobs without question new technology will eliminate work it always has at the same time new job categories will emerge the challenge however is that ai will transform the skills required for all jobs there still will be doctors lawyers salespeople teachers and engineers but the tasks and tools they need to perform their work will be differentthis is why building skills for the jobs of the futurenot blue collar or white collar but new collar jobswill require a major reinvention of education we at ibm are leading that transformation in the us and worldwide through publicprivate partnerships to create the revolutionary pathways in technology early college high schools ptech education model st century apprenticeships and retraining programs this includes investing  billion over  years in the continuous renewal of ibmers and the reskilling of midcareer professionals looking to get back into the tech workforce on inclusion today we proudly carry forward a global commitment to inclusion that has defined ibm for more than a century we are stepping forward to support the open exchange of people information and ideas as well as to protect crossborder data flows for international privacy and security agreements ibm is the recognized gold standard for inclusion reflected in winning the  catalyst award for advancing women in business ibm is the first company to win this award four times we advocate for fairness and equalityas everyone is and always has been welcome at ibm for more than a century ibmers have earned the worlds trust by building progress with responsibility we continue this legacy today rediscovering ibm at the deepest level the most important fact about ibms  was not our return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter or the continued scaling of our new products and services or our patent achievement it is our reaffirmation of ibms essential identity ibm is an enterprise technology company we deliver services with the simplicity speed and delight of the best consumer products and services but we are very clear on whom we serve we are dedicated to our clients success and our reinvention during the past five years

chapter of digital reinvention for the past several years businesses around the world have been driving their digital reinventions to take advantage of data their most powerful source of competitive advantage this first chapter has been defined largely by experimenting with narrow and disparate ai applications and moving simple workloadstypically consumer and customerfacing applications to the cloud now we are beginning to see the contours of chapter  among pioneering businesses moving from experimentation to true business transformation at scale with ai and hybrid cloud this next chapter of digital reinvention will be enterprisedriven it will be characterized first by scaling ai and embedding it everywhere in business second in cloud it will be characterized by moving missioncritical applications to hybrid cloud using a combination of multiple public clouds private clouds and onpremise it capabilities so businesses can create the environment most suitable for their enterprise workloads underpinning it all is the growing importance of trust both in technologies and in their impact on the world scaling ai throughout the enterprise in chapter  of their digital reinventions businesses will begin to scale ai across the enterprise as some first movers are already demonstrating take the worlds leading banks for example while many have been applying ai to specific challenges some first movers are scaling ai across the enterprise orange bank one of the fastest growing mobile banks in france now manages all customer service through ibm watson similarly banco bradesco is now using ibm watson to assist every member of its services teamresolving customer inquiries in seconds with nearly  percent accuracy ibm brought ai for business into the mainstream with the introduction of our watson platform in  today ibm watson is the most open and trusted ai for business available to run on any environmenton premise and in private and public clouds businesses can apply watson to data wherever it is hosted and infuse ai into their applications regardless of where they reside with watson studio watson machine learning and watson openscale ibm delivers a suite of tools that allow enterprises to build deploy and manage their ai models in a hybrid cloud environment ibm watson openscale a firstofakind platform introduced in  also enables businesses to manage their ai no

throughout an enterprise through ibm services we are helping our clients around the world apply ai to core business processes and workflows infusing their businesses with automation intelligence and continuous learning to transform everything from supply chains and hr to finance and operations in  we also launched a new service called ibm talent and transformation that addresses the often overlooked cultural aspects of ai this service helps our clients ensure their teams have the right skills and talentand the supporting culture and work environmentto support a new way of working that is critical to scaling ai for business moving missioncritical work to hybrid cloud in the first chapter of digital reinvention cloud deployments largely focused on easily portable workloads for productivity and commodity computing this primarily was driven by userfacing applications inspired by advances in consumer technology as a result only  percent of enterprise workloads today have moved to the cloud the remaining  percent of enterprise workloads provides the real value opportunity for businesstransforming missioncritical workloads and applications for the cloud the challenge is that most businesses have unique regulatory or data requirements and anywhere from five to  clouds across multiple providers that is why businesses moving to chapter  will need to embrace a new hybrid cloud approach it is one that will allow them to more easily move data and scale ai and other applications across public private and onpremise it in their enterprises with consistent management and security protocols using open source technology for example bnp paribas a leading european bank is working with ibm to speed and scale the launch of new digital and ai customer services across the cloud while protecting the security and confi dentiality of customer data similarly global telecom leader vodafone business is partnering with ibm to innovate the way it delivers multicloud and

partners they can trust to protect their data and handle it responsibly they want to work with partners who know how to bring new technologies into the world safely and help society benefi t from them and they want their partners to create inclusive workplaces and communities where diversity thrivesthese expectations are linked by a common theme responsibility responsibility has been a hallmark of ibms culture for  yearsfrom our labs to our boardroom ibmers unwavering global commitment to the responsible stewardship of data and powerful new technologies has earned us the trust of clients and society as a whole in  as trust in technology came under heightened global scrutiny we published our ibm principles for trust and transparency which have long guided our company they stress our belief that the purpose of new technologies is to augment not replacehuman intelligence and that the data and insights derived from technology belong to the businesses who own them the principles also emphasize that new technologies brought into the world must be open transparent explainable and free of bias we know that ai like other transformative technologies before it will have a profound impact on peoples jobs and the workplace that is why in  ibm further expanded access to the pathways through which students and professionals can build skills for todays technology era that includes new collar jobs where having the right skills matters more than having a specific degree through our work in  us states and  countries there will be  pathways in technology early college high schools or ptechsserving a pipeline of  students in the  school year  also saw the rapid growth of our ibm apprenticeship program which trains people in stcentury skills ranging from blockchain and digital design to cybersecurityand which expanded nearly twice as fast as we had projected in its first year yet skills are only part of todays workforce opportunity in  fueled by record diverse hiring promotion and retention we achieved our greatest progress in a decade on diversity representation among global executive women and underrepresented minorities we also continued advocating with governments around the world for policies that help ensure workplaces are as inclusive and diverse as the world we live in recognizing that responsible stewardship should not be confined within ibms walls we also are working aggressively to empower others to do lasting good we are for example a founding partner in call for code a global initiative that works with software developers to create solutions that can help save lives last year  open source developers from  countries responded to the call creating more than  applications to help communities recover from natural disasters as ibm sees it the promise of technology is to empower people to do good access new opportunities and make the world better safer and smarterfor the many not just the few ibm poised to lead in summary we have returned your company to growth we have positioned ibms products services and people to enable clients to write the next chapter of their digital reinventions and we have done it all while

109,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2002,fellow shareholders on behalf of the  thousand xerox people around the world i am pleased  no thrilled  to report that we have gone a long way to restoring xerox to good financial health and positioned our company for a period of growth and opportunity if i sound bullish on xerox its because i am we have weathered the most serious crisis in our history and emerged a company that is stronger different and better  a company prepared and resolved to take xerox to new levels of greatness doing what we say we will do perhaps most importantly we believe we have begun to earn your trust a year ago we made a series of commitments to you and we have already made good on most of them we said we would improve liquidity and we did last year we generated operating cash flow of  billion since the end of  we have reduced total debt by  billion and we ended the year with  billion cash on hand we said we would begin to drive equipment sales and we have  by making  our biggest new product year ever equipment sales declines have moderated substantially in each of the last five quarters thats a very encouraging trend and a key part of our strategy equipment sales not only add revenue today they add to our profitable post sales revenue stream tomorrow we said we would improve our gross margins to the high s and we exceeded our commitment our gross margins in  were  percent some of that improvement was reinvested as price decreases for our customerswe said we would drive selling administrative and general sag costs down and we have we reduced sag costs by six percent last year and implemented actions under the turnaround program which will reduce our total cost base by  billion we said we would return xerox to fullyear profitability and we did after absorbing  million of pretax restructuring charges we were able to report a return to profitability in  all of our major operations were profitable for the full year over the past two years we have reduced costs improved liquidity stabilized our business strengthened our business model invested in our future and laid out a plan to return to growth and to provide value for our shareholders but all of us at xerox are keenly aware that last years accomplishments are yesterdays news the task before us now is to harness our momentum and take xerox to the next level of greatness we are well on our way opportunities for growth xerox has three strong opportunities for growth over the next several years there is of course the production market which we lead and which is growing at about two percent a year it is expected to reach  billion by  within that market digital production color  where xerox has a commanding lead  is growing much more rapidly at more than  percent per year a strong array of systems and solutions  led by the xerox docucolor igen digital production press  promises to dramatically expand the market opportunity for xerox there is every reason to expect that we can grow faster than the market as a whole by driving the new business of printing in areas such as onetoone marketing and printondemand early customer response to our new generation of color production technology has been very encouraging our second opportunity is in the office  a market that is relatively flat but very large at  billion a year xerox is entrenched in the office and we are competitively advantaged in segments of the market that are growing the fastest three examples color in the office digital multifunction devices and valueadded office solutions and services as this report goes to press we will be introducing new technology for the office  products and services that will further expand our fleet of worldclass offerings they will include new solutions a new family of black and white multifunction products and color printers and our third opportunity is in the services market which is growing at around  percent a year this market includes knowledge content and document management  areas where we have considerable expertise and resources our highly successful document outsourcing business gives us a strong base on which to build more than  xerox employees currently work on site in hundreds of customer offices around the world they operate inhouse printing and copying centers and manage document workflow across the enterprise for our customers more and more these customers are turning to us for help in redesigning processes improving productivity and strengthening customer relationships  all starting from our base of knowledge and expertise around the document in aggregate these three opportunities  production the office and services  give us lots of room to run we do not want for opportunity we are engaged in three attractive markets where we can choose our sweet spots add value for our customers grow profitable revenue for xerox and reward our shareholders for their investments we estimate that over time these three markets will yield five percent a year revenue growth  even more if we are highly successful in areas such as digital production printing color high value solutions for the office and services our vision for the future if you think of xerox as a world leader in office products like copiers and printers you are only halfright to be sure we have the broadest and deepest set of products in our industry  an arsenal of products that were substantially strengthened in  and will be again in  but thats only part of the story i spend a lot of my time  every opportunity i get really  talking to chief executive officers and chief information officers i hear several common themes emerge over and over they need to drive significant improvements in productivity they need to access information quickly anytime anywhere they want to outsource parts of their business that others can do more effectively they want to be able to market more effectively and to serve their customers more efficiently increasingly these business leaders are turning to xerox for help  thats why bank of america asked xerox to manage its fleet of  hundred digital multifunction devices and two thousand light lens copiers  a threeyear contract worth over  million that will save money for the bank  thats why unitedhealth group called on xerox to manage their extensive human resource records as they migrate to a paperless internet world their twin goals are lower costs and improved customer satisfaction  thats why lloyds tsb asked xerox to manage seven digital print centers that form the heart of their marketing communications operations  at an annual expected savings of  million in todays economy businesses and organizations of all sizes face the challenge of improving their performance or being overtaken by the tide of change  whether its more effective communication with customers leveraging what a company knows exploiting the opportunity of new technology or simply reducing costs and boosting productivity improving results requires rethinking how work gets done this is what xerox does best our vision is both simple and powerful helping people find better ways to do great work since the introduction of the plain paper copier xerox has been about transforming the workplace through our worldclass research and technology our expertise in printing and production our skills and experience in content document and knowledge management and our experience in process innovation we serve as change agents enabling customers to improve business processes and bottom line results what shareholders can expect it would not be an exaggeration to say that our performance last year has gone a long way to restoring both our health  access information quickly anytime anywhere they want to outsource parts of their business that others can do more effectively they want to be able to market more effectively and to serve their customers more efficiently increasingly

110,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2003,fellow shareholders it is with enormous pride in our people that i am able to report to you that  was another year of good progress excellent execution and accelerating marketplace momentum for xerox everywhere you look the signs are positive take a look at the charts accompanying this letter we generated near record amounts of cash from operations significantly reduced both debt and cost maintained gross margins and recapitalized the company even more importantly we brought to market an expansive armada of innovative technology and services gained market share in key segments of our business grew equipment sales by  percent and won scores of large customer contracts  many of them in direct faceoffs with our best competitors across the board and around the world we did what we said we would do in   and then somein many ways the curtain has closed on the xerox turnaround but we are keenly aware that most great plays have two acts as pleased as we are with our performance the past few years we know that it has merely set the stage for what is to come next  a period of growth and greatness for xerox and for xerox shareholders we are already busy creating that future fortunately we do not want for opportunity i spend a lot of time with our customers  every chance i get and every time i do i come away bullish on our prospects for growth chief executive officers and chief information officers have some very common and critical problems the need to reduce costs and boost productivity the desire to get closer to their existing customers and attract new ones the need to make sense of a dizzying array of new technologies and an almost desperate desire to optimize their investments in technology and make sure that technology is working for them and not against them and whenever i hear those customer needs i know that xerox is part of the solution let me give you three examples of how we are helping our customers deal with their most pressing business problems  in more than  bluechip companies xerox has done rigorous office document assessments to understand document workflows we are saving these customers an average of  percent of their document costs and streamlining their processes as well  in a growing list of marketing companies our digital printing solutions are enabling our customers to communicate with their customers more effectively we are helping hundreds of our customers find what up to now has been the elusive holy grail of marketing  the ability to communicate with large customer bases with onetoone precision at just the right time with just the right information while eliminating the need to maintain inventories of marketing materials that quickly become obsolete in global enterprises around the world we are helping our customers maximize their investments in information technology and helping them make documentintensive work processes more efficient more impactful and more user friendly companies like microsoft lloyds sun microsystems and siemens have turned to xerox for help i could go on but you get the point the copier giant has transformed itself into a leading technology and services company  with an important twist too many organizations focus on the wrong side of information technology  putting too much emphasis on the technology and not enough on the information with smart document management services were helping our customers focus more on the information and ideas captured in documents than on the technology needed to produce them a case in point is the work we are doing with a major airline we are helping them manage their documents so that they structure their own content automate their own distribution and approvals track signoff by the right person retire documents to a central repository and provide reporting statistics to management thats what we mean by smart document management its also smart business the process reduces the risk of delayed flight departures and arrivals practically eliminates the likelihood of a bad compliance report by the faa and saves them threequarters of a million dollars a year we have continued to invest heavily in research and development and to focus that investment on helping our customers find better ways to do great work even in our darkest days we never considered mortgaging our future what a hollow victory it would have been to save the company from financial failure only to suffer the consequences of a technological drought over the last two years we have brought to market some  new products as well as a rich portfolio of smart documentrelated services these investments are already paying off in fact more than half of our equipment sale revenue last year  and  percent in the fourth quarter  came from offerings that were introduced in the past two years that pace will only quicken in the years ahead we not only continue to invest heavily but weve also become very smart in focusing that investment on solving real problems that real people have in the real world last year we were awarded  patents to place us among a handful of leaders worldwide these are not patents for the sake of numbers one of the hallmarks of the new xerox is a deep desire to be connected to the realities of our customers and we work at it with a passion and pervasiveness that no other company in our industry can match  more than  xerox managed services employees currently work onsite in hundreds of customer locations around the world  our cadre of  senior executives have each accepted personal responsibility for at least one of our major accounts  our research labs regularly host customers for twoway communication exchanges  our product developers and engineers as they are quick to tell you spend more time in the field with our customers than at any time in our history  and of course our unsurpassed field sales and service force of some  people worldwide are intimately involved with their clients on a daily basis from top to bottom xerox people are tightly connected to our customers and their businesses for us its very personal our customers are not faceless names but real people with aspirations and needs and dreams that we want to help them realize as a result we are focused on three areas where we can help them be more successfulthere is of course the  billion production market which we lead a strong array of systems and solutions  led by the xerox docucolor igen digital production press  promises to dramatically expand the market opportunity for xerox as you will see elsewhere in this report our new generation of digital technology and services expands our market opportunity threefold we are driving the new business of printing in areas such as onetoone marketing and printondemand early customer response to our new generation of color production technology has been very encouraging by years end we had installed more than  docucolor igen presses many customers are buying more than one in fact our leading docucolor igen partner already has a halfdozen our second opportunity is in the office a market that is huge xerox is well established in this market and focused on segments that are growing the fastest  color digital multifunction and office services and solutions last year we brought  new offerings to the office market  color and blackandwhite printers and copiers multifunction and services  at price points that are highly competitive our customers approved we participated in more buying decisions than ever before  and were winning our third opportunity is in the services market in which we are making significant inroads our customers  particularly our larger ones  are turning to us for help in designing and improving work processes that are document intensive these include mining customer databases for onetoone marketing applications content management and retrieval seamless integration of paper and digital documents and a host of other applications our successful document outsourcing business gives us a strong base on which to build three years ago we made a critical strategic decision  to place our investment bets on market segments that were growing the fastest where our customers needed help and where we could add value that meant putting our technology and innovation muscle and brainpower behind digital production the digital office color and valueadded services last year  percent of our revenue came from these areas and revenue from these segments grew  percentat the same time we made another strategic bet we substantially deepened and widened our distribution channels with an eye to reaching more customers in the way they want while reducing unnecessary costs to xerox although our direct sales force is still one of our crown jewels it is augmented by an equally effective network of agents concessionaires valueadded resellers retailers and a worldclass teleweb operation xerox now claims the broadest and deepest set of offerings in our industry and the broadest and deepest network of distribution channels its a winning combination if i sound bullish its because i am we are in the right markets with the technology to expand those markets over time we have the right offerings that help our customers find better ways to do great work and we have the right business model which delivers both operational excellence and consistently improving performance when i wrote to you last year i said that one of our key priorities was to continue to establish credibility with you and to earn your trust that is very important to all of us at xerox we now have a threeyear track record of delivering on some very specific commitments we have an attractive and predictable business model with a large recurring revenue stream and we have strengthened and streamlined business processes that enable us to better manage our business with improved efficiencies just as importantly we have a premium brand in the attractive and expanding  billion document market a vast distribution network led by a global sales and service force that the rest of our industry only dreams about worldclass technology and innovation fueled by leading labs and scientists around the world a knowledge and savviness about our customers document needs that builds on a rich heritage and our passionate engagement with our customers a focused strategy of investing for growth in markets where we can add value  and the enormous talent of  people in more than a hundred countries who are committed to success as you might expect the size of our opportunities and the soundness of our strategies has attracted some very tough competitors we do not shrink from that challenge it energizes us all of us at xerox believe our best days are ahead of us and we believe just as firmly that the caliber of our competitors and the demands of our customers will only strengthen our resolve to execute tomorrow even better than we do today our  plan is for flat revenue with margin and earnings expansion followed by a return to revenue growth operating margin expansion and continued earnings growth in  and beyond as the curtain goes up on our second act all the pieces are in place to return xerox to growth and greatness we are confident but not arrogant assured but not complacent we constantly remind ourselves that the enemy of great is good none of us at xerox wants to be just good enough we are on a road whose destination is nothing short of greatness you should expect no less we aim to deliver no less we are keenly aware that you put a lot of faith in us earning your trust energizes us we believe we have demonstrated consistency and credibility over the past three years and we are determined to keep earning your trust in  and beyond,0.36,1.0
111,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2004,a s i write this letter i am enormously proud of what xerox people have accomplished over the past few years galvanized by the opportunities we see immediately ahead of us sobered by the demands of the marketplace and the strength of our competitors and humbled by the trust you have placed in us our goal is to give you a good return on that trust  and thats precisely what we are all hard at work doing proud of our accomplishments over the past four years we believe we have put together a rather remarkable track record we have just about cut our debt in half more than doubled our equity taken  billion out of our cost base strengthened our offerings expanded our distribution channels articulated a clear vision for the future made the right strategic investments and consistently increased earnings  building value for our shareholders our progress in  provided more evidence that we are on the right track and building strong momentum  we brought  new products to market  products that set new industry standards for the creation of customer value and which garnered some  industry awards  we were granted  utility patents in the united states alone  a sign that our best days are ahead of us  sales administrative and general sag costs declined to  percent of revenue  the lowest in years  cash flow from operations was  billion  we reduced debt by another  billion  and we ended the year with a cash balance of  billion the charts that accompany this letter tell the story of a company that has returned to good financial health we deliver consistent predictable results we do what we say we will do we also realize that as good as we are today we must be even better tomorrow so rather than simply rehash the past i want to take this opportunity to share our plans for the future poised for growth as the story of the xerox turnaround gets written im confident that it will say that while we were focused on reducing costs boosting productivity and slashing debt we were equally focused on implementing a strategy for growth investing in our future and creating value for our shareholders that strategy starts with spending a lot of time with our customers many companies preach that we practice it someone just figured out how much of my own time i spend with our clients the notsosurprising answer is about  percent all of my senior team maintains an equally aggressive schedule of customer engagement we estimate that some  percent of our people have regular contact with our customers and one in five of our people work on site in our customers places of business why because were keenly aware that it takes five times as much effort and money to attract a new customer as it does to keep an old one even more importantly we know that if we listen to our customers  really listen  they will tell us what we need to do to be successful what we learn permeates all our decisions and what weve learned is that our customers dont simply want our products  at least thats not how they express their needsthey want our help in reducing costs improving productivity growing revenue and creating value for their customers thats exactly what were helping them do in more and more accounts large and small we are becoming strategic partners the copier and hardware company has morphed into a technology and services enterprise four years ago we made a series of critical strategic decisions on where to invest we used three simple but profound criteria  areas of our market that were growing the fastest areas where our customers were telling us they needed help and areas where we already had core competencies on which we could build we let go of businesses where we couldnt make money in the short term or articulate a credible plan to make money in the long term that freed up resources for investment in three critical areas of the document market  the digital office digital production and valueadded services thats where we placed our strategic bets were glad we did last year threequarters of our revenue came from these businesses and revenues from these areas grew  percent for the first time in five years growth in our strategic areas of focus including the effects of favorable currency offset declines in older technology and other nonstrategic businesses now we are positioned for growth in  and beyond heres why leading the digital revolution in the office in the digital office were concentrating our investments on the key growth areas of color digital multifunction and office services we continue to expand our portfolio of products at price points that are highly competitive as a result we are participating in more and more buying decisions one way we create value for our office customers is through our office document assessmentsm a recent industry report indicates that twothirds of all businesses have initiatives in place that are aimed at reducing the cost of document management you might think thats a threat to us we see it as an opportunity until recently the costs of documents flew under the radar screens of most chief information officers once digital technology put documents on the network that dramatically changed the way document management is viewed with the help of xerox more and more cios are recognizing that they can simultaneously reduce costs and improve workflows using xerox lean six sigma methodology we analyze in detail all of the documentintensive processes our customers use to run their businesses we identify the exact costs of the way our customers manage printing copying faxing and scanning functions perhaps even more importantly we analyze the way real people work with real documents in the real world we estimate that a typical business spends up to  percent of its revenue on documents we can save  to  percent of that while improving productivity speed and worker satisfaction the opportunity for xerox is substantial and we are being very aggressive about seizing itbuilding the new business of printing the second area in which we are investing is the digital production market our strong array of digital systems and solutions  led by the xerox igen digital production press and augmented by the highly acclaimed xerox nuvera family of products  promises to dramatically expand our market opportunity market response to our new generation of color production technology has been very encouraging increasingly our commercial print customers are relying on the igen to fuel their business growth in fact many igen customers own multiple systems  some own six or more we are driving the new business of printing in areas such as onetoone marketing printondemand and ondemand book publishing one example is a large retail customer who maintains many bridal registries after the couple returns from their honeymoon and settles into married life they receive a special sales promotion of all the products they had selected for their registry but didnt receive the brochure is printed on a xerox igen direct mail experts consider a percent response to be quite good this promotion runs about  percent thats the power of onetoone marketing  power we bring to our customers digital production printing is a huge market opportunity for xerox as more and more customers see that they can augment traditional offset printing and penetrate new markets with new applications that create new revenue streams its the ultimate winwinwin  for xerox for xerox customers and for their customers leading with valueadded services the third area in which we are investing is valueadded services here too we are making a great deal of progress in fact revenue from our valueadded services business grew  percent last year and  percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago more and more our customers  particularly our larger ones  are turning to us for help in designing and improving work processes that are document intensive we provide consulting imaging content management and outsourcing services that help our customers reduce costs through processes that deliver the right information in the right form at the right time although we manage our business in three areas we go to market as one xerox the umbrella for much of what we do  the value we provide  is something we call smarter document management just about every organization you can think of has made significant investments in information technology over the past several years in fact between  and  united states companies alone invested an estimated  trillion in the promise of information technology many are still looking for the return they are realizing that more is not necessarily better xerox is uniquely positioned to help our customers leverage and streamline their legacy investments and make wise investment decisions going forward since our earliest days we have been on a mission to harness the marvels of technology to the needs of people we take a holistic approach that considers the way people work the culture they work in the processes they work with the objectives they strive for in other words we help our customers find better ways to do great work through the use of smarter document management its an area in which we are uniquely advantaged these three market areas  digital office digital production and valueadded services  total more than  billion of market opportunity today advances in digital technology many of them driven by xerox are likely to significantly expand the market size in the years ahead we do not want for opportunity the only thing that stands between xerox and significant growth is execution and that fortunately is entirely within our own control its a good place to be shareholder value our mantra if i sound optimistic about our future its because i am but dont mistake optimism for hubris all of us at xerox recognize that we are in a race without a finish line our competitors are formidable and they are not standing still our customers are demanding that we stay on the leading edge of technology and services our shareholders are expecting us to deliver premium returns we dont shrink from these expectations we embrace them this generation of xerox people has been tested weve learned from our mistakes at a recent town meeting a xerox employee asked me what our greatest strength and weakness was as i looked to the future my answer our greatest strength is our people  a highly motivated group of individuals who are committed to their customers passionate about the success of xerox and on a mission to drive shareholder value and our weakness that we start believing our own press that we even subconsciously start to behave as though good enough really is good enough thats something we ferociously guard against were building a culture that is problem curious that abhors the status quo that looks at every challenge as an opportunity to improve all of you have put your trust in us  many of you at a time when others were writing our obituary its something we will never forget ever by the way just about every xerox person around the world is a shareowner we are all in this together we are all focused on creating shareholder value and were making good progress xeroxs share price increased  percent last year contributing to a threeyear cumulative annual growth rate of  percent were proud of that but we also know that its yesterdays news we realize better than most how easy it is to lose our way avoiding that pitfall is what energizes us we are all focused on a few simple objectives  focusing on our customers with precision and passion growing revenue and improving profitability if we do that well we know we will create value for our shareholders and give you a good return on the trust you place in us you should expect no less we aim to deliver no less,0.859,1.0
112,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2005,i am pleased to report another solid year of progress for xerox our company is in excellent financial health our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger our new business model is doing what we intended whatever the challenges of our business we are able to adjust quickly and produce earnings growth in fact we have met or exceeded our earnings expectations in  of the last  quarters our global operations are producing significant cash flow at the same time we have virtually eliminated debt except for the debt that supports our customer financing activities as a result of our performance as well as confidence that it will continue the xerox board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase  billion in xerox common shares its a tangible way to deliver shareholder value and to assure you that we take very seriously the trust you have placed in usour progress in  provided more evidence that we are on track and continuing to build momentum  net income of  million or  cents per share an increase of  percent from fullyear   gross margins of  percent  in line with our expectations  selling general and administrative sag expenses of  percent of revenue  down onehalf point from the previous year  debt balance of  billion a reduction of  billion from yearend   and virtually all of what remains is in support of our customer financing activities  operating cash flow of  billion  yearend cash and shortterm investments balance of  billion xerox is at a pivotal point we get a lot of credit these days for turning xerox around were pleased by that but hardly satisfied all of our hard work these past five years has been done with a singleminded purpose  to return xerox to growth thereby providing value to our shareholders we made progress in  but not enough we accelerated the pace of install activity for xerox digital systems such as color printers digital presses and multifunction devices that print copy fax and scan in fact activity increased by doubledigit rates in our key markets at the same time we aggressively ramped our services business winning more global consulting contracts for xeroxs document management expertise all of this bodes well for our longterm success increased equipment installs drives more pages printed on xerox systems more pages fuel growth for xerox supplies and service this translates into postsale revenue which represents about  percent of xeroxs total revenue more multiyear contracts for xeroxs document management services also flows through to support our annuity stream our postsale revenue turned positive in the second half of   an important sign that our annuitybased business model is working however total revenue was flat slightly below our expectations we know we can do better and are confident we will and thats what id like to take this opportunity to discuss with you  how we will grow xerox over the next few yearswe do business in a very attractive  and therefore very competitive  market that currently affords us a  billion opportunity parts of that market are stable parts are growing rapidly and parts are being created in each we have a clear consistent and credible strategy simply put its this  compete aggressively and effectively in the relatively stable  billion digital blackandwhite printing market  drive the rapidly growing  billion digital color printing market where the breadth and depth of our technology gives us a commanding competitive advantage  create a new  billion market by harnessing digital technology to the world of offset printing with applications such as printondemand personalized communications and onetoone marketing we call it the new business of printing  lead the burgeoning document services market by working with our customers to reduce document costs streamline processes and enable the free flow of documents down the hall crosstown and around the world thats the opportunity were attacking its a blend of markets where we have traditionally competed and natural extensions of those markets  extensions that are enabled by new technology and inspired by the evolving needs of our customers a question im often asked by investors is how xerox believes it will win in this  billion market its a fair question when i reflect on it i believe there are six tangible  and one intangible  reasons why xerox will succeed first our technology  a past present and future strong suit for xerox we routinely invest  percent of our revenues in research development and engineering our research investments are closely aligned with our growth strategy this way were always outrunning our competitors for example xerox and our partner fuji xerox are jointly investing about twothirds of our combined research and development budget on color over the last decade this investment has resulted in more than  colorrelated patents during  we brought  new products to market  products that won more than  industry awards in fact fully twothirds of our equipment sales last year came from products introduced in the past two yearsits fair to say that no other company has a broader or better set of offerings than xerox perhaps more importantly we remain committed to our ongoing investment in research and technology  investment that is yielding great returns during  the xerox scientific community was awarded  patents placing the patent portfolio in the top  of american companies and in  we filed  percent more patent applications than in the previous year this relentless focus on innovation assures us that we will be able to bring added value to our customers far into the future second color the demand for color in todays world is great our response is straightforward  make it affordable and make it easy to use that strategy has made us the revenue leader in a market that is expected to double by  color has rapidly become a businesscritical tool for our customers more and more businesses are shifting to digital color systems to produce personalized colorful materials such as marketing collaterals financial statements catalogs and user guides on xerox digital devices the number of pages printed on xerox color devices has doubled in the past two years in fact color now represents approximately  percent of our total revenue the potential for color technology is as enormous as it is profitable two facts stand out around  percent of the pages printed or copied on xerox devices today are color and color pages are five times more profitable than blackandwhite the combination presents us with a world of opportunity we intend to capture it third our superior knowledge of documents and the way people work with them ever since creating the plainpaper copier industry  years ago documents have been part of the dna of xerox we have research teams around the world that study the flow of documents in a workplace and develop smarter software and services that simplify this workflow our customers in industries such as health care legal and manufacturing rely solely on xerox to manage the huge volume of paper and digital documents that keep their businesses running as we like to say we know more about the document care more about the document and can do more with the document than anyone in our industry period thats an enormous advantage as the document becomes more digital more dynamic and more critical to the conduct of business heretofore the substantial cost of documents flew under the radar screen of most chief information officers and chief financial officers everyone used documents but no one was accountable for their management that is rapidly changing and it plays to our expertise we can save our customers up to  percent of their document costs and we are an increasing number of customers are turning to us to simplify their documentintensive work processes manage their documentrelated assets develop systems to easily store search and retrieve digital files and provide other services that add value fourth our broadening portfolio of distribution channels it includes  sales professionals  agents and concessionaires  resellers a worldclass teleweb operation strong oem relationships it and consulting partners  all backed up by industry experts and business analysts its a critical mass of people and expertise that no one else can match those distribution and consulting resources span the world and give us a presence that global customers covet digital documents and business enterprises dont stop at geographic boundaries neither does our ability to help our customersa growing list of global companies are turning to xerox for help in managing their worldwide document needs the dow chemical company is a good example theyve signed a  million deal with us to consolidate all of their document assets  printers copiers fax machines and scanners  in  countries dow will get more technology at less cost seamless integration around the world and the value of working with a global partner we believe arrangements such as this are the wave of the future you can read more about our relationship with dow on page  in this report fifth the customercentric culture we have built and continue to strengthen our people recognize that the customer is our priority among priorities  the reason we exist some  of our people  thats one in five  literally work every day on customer sites we work with our customers offering not just our products but also providing solutions to the most pressing problems of our customers the vast majority of our leadership team  including people such as our chief accounting officer and general counsel  have personal responsibility for the relationship with one of our major customers whenever i call on a customer  and thats every chance i get  they tell me that the most important reason they do business with us is the caliber and commitment of our people its a priceless asset sixth the strength of our brand we nurture it we invest in it and we know that it opens doors gives us permission to compete for business and positions us as an attractive and trusted partner one recent brandbuilding achievement is worthy of special mention jd power and associates named xerox the first document management company to receive its certification for excellence in customer service and support jd power evaluated the breadth of our onsite phone and online customer service in addition auditors conducted several comprehensive visits to our call centers and surveyed hundreds of our customers its quite an honor and one that will motivate us to strive for even higher levels of performanceso there you have it  a halfdozen reasons that give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace and should serve to give you confidence that you have invested your money wisely as i write this letter i am gathered with the senior leadership team of xerox  some  individuals whom i am proud to call my colleagues they and the people they lead are the intangible reason i am confident we will continue to be successful most of the leadership team has been with the company through our most challenging times others were recruited to xerox to fill gaps in our capabilities and provide leadership in key areas all chose to be part of our turnaround to be with us during the most difficult yet most rewarding period in our history they inherited a company that lost  million dollars in  but had a noble history and they brought it back to a company that made  million last year adding another inspiring chapter to a storied past they refused to let xerox fail exhibiting what ive come to call steely optimism in the face of enormous adversity while others predicted failure they said not on our watch xerox cannot and will not fail they showed their true colors now they are focused with an intensity thats hard to describe but easy to feel they are writing another chapter in our history  the story of our return to growth as i met and talked with the leadership team this week i was galvanized by their dissatisfaction with the status quo to them good is not good enough they are on a mission to put xerox back on a growth trajectory and give you a solid return on the trust you place in us as one of them put it weve been playing defense now its time to play offensewere proud of our accomplishments but not satisfied were confident in our strategy but not complacent were bullish on our future but take nothing for granted because our opportunities are large our competition is formidable as we get better so do they as we deliver value to our customers they expect more as you invest in us you anticipate greater returns we do not shrink from those expectations

flexible we adapt to changes in the marketplace holding steady on our gross margins and increasing earnings for our shareholders our leadership team and our people are aligned around a common set of objectives aimed at delivering shareholder value you should expect no less we aim to deliver no less because of our people i believe our best days are ahead of us  just ahead,0.978,1.0

believe we are on our way to a better one our growth strategy while were proud of our accomplishments what gives me the greatest pride in our leadership team is that were not satisfied hubris is not a part of our vocabulary good enough is simply not good enough for xerox were keenly aware that the last frontier we need to tame is accelerating revenue growth there are several reasons to believe this is within our reach while were justifiably known for our technology were running an annuitybased business that generates more than  percent of revenue from what we call post sale this is the sale of supplies  like ink and toner  and technical services that are needed to support our products as well as revenue from financing our customers purchases it also includes consulting and outsourcing services such as document imaging and archiving managing our customers print shops simplifying their work processes and much more last year was a turning point in growing our postsale revenue  up  percent for the year  as the annuity from our digital color and services businesses helped to offset losses from our older light lens business this positive trend is expected to continue in fact we expect it will accelerate as light lens becomes less and less of the total and the annuity from our strong growth markets kicks in we have four planks in our growth strategy each builds on our core competencies each responds to customer need with customer value each is designed to fuel our annuity stream through longterm contracts and each is yielding good results heres a snapshot of how were doing in each of our four growth strategies the first is to lead in color weve been investing heavily in leading with the transition to color in the office and in expanding our leadership position in the production market last year we brought eight new color products to market strengthening what was already the broadest and deepest set of technologies in our industry weve already announced five more color products this year and were just getting started the competition doesnt stand still and neither do we the power of color is in the pages color pages generate significantly more revenue and profit than blackandwhite pages were already seeing this benefit flow through to our annuity postsale revenue from color was up  percent in  much of that is due to the  percent increase in color pages more than  billion color pages were printed on xerox color systems last year thats close to double what we were doing two years ago color now represents nine percent of total xerox pages as that percentage grows so too will our all important postsale revenue stream its a great business model and its working our second strategic platform for growth is what we call the new business of printing  its a market where xerox is competitively advantaged our customers in this space are typically commercial printers marketing and graphic arts companies and large enterprises they depend on digital printing to print on demand produce short runs of books personalize documents as they come off the press and leverage the power of our digital technology in a myriad of other ways our digital presses sophisticated workflow capabilities and expanding set of solutions and applications help our customers grow their businesses new products helped drive a  percent increase in installs of xeroxs production color publishing systems and printers  thats actual placements in a customers workplace we closely track install data as an indicator of whats to come in postsale revenue the more color products we sell the more pages printed on xerox systems more pages mean more profitable annuity all adding up to sustainable growth one especially satisfying trend the acceptance of the xerox igen digital production press our flagship and unparalleled product that creates up to  fullcolor impressions per minute with the ability to personalize each and every one the igen is a winner with our customers in fact some  customers now own more than one and about  of our customers igens produce more than  million images per month last year we acquired xmpie for  million xmpie provides software that enables multimedia campaigns with personalized email web sites catalogs brochures and other documents when applied to direct marketing campaigns these capabilities significantly increase standard response rates and open up new ways for marketing professionals to communicate with their customers youve probably received marketing materials in the mail that are targeted to your personal buying needs  like postcards from car dealers with an image of the new version of your car including a license plate with your initials or a travel itinerary from a cruise line featuring activities that appeal to your individual interests these marketing campaigns cut through the clutter theyre personalized colorful and most likely printed on xerox color systems using xmpie software the market for variable data jobs that capture individual information such as name address account information and photographs is projected to grow from  billion pages in  to  billion pages in  thats an annual compounded growth rate of  percent xerox is in the forefront of driving that market opportunity our third strategy for growth is to lead in services in our major accounts  and here too were making good progress our services signings last year were up over  percent from the previous year customers who are entrusting us to manage large enterprise systems include the likes of medco and honeywell the university of calgary and microsoft officemax and united technologies and moreand we believe its the tip of the iceberg more and more large customers are turning to us for help in simplifying their documentintensive work processes bridging the divide between paper and digital documents managing their infrastructure and creating digital systems that allow them to easily store search and retrieve their digital files we call this smarter document management its a market where xerox is uniquely advantaged  drawing upon our heritage in understanding how people work with documents and adding our rich portfolio of digital applications and technology during  we acquired amici llc for  million amici is the market leader in ediscovery technology which involves the identification filtering production and storage of relevant data from paper or electronic documents such as email text files memos databases presentations and spreadsheets projected to grow at an annual compounded rate of close to  percent ediscovery services could be a nearly  billion market in the united states alone by  now a part of xerox litigation services amici helps position us to go after this burgeoning market the fourth plank in our growth strategy is to aggressively attack the small and medium business smb market its a  billion opportunity where our presence has been modest segments of the market however are growing  especially in developing countries in color and in multifunction devices here too we are making excellent progress last year we introduced four products targeted to this segment and earlier this year we launched seven more at the same time we continue to expand our distribution channels we recently announced our most significant investment in resellers and independent agents since launching these sales channels several years ago that means there will be more feet on the street selling xerox systems and services and greater xerox brand visibility in the smb market our strategy is straightforward more technology plus more distribution equals more growth were attacking a  billion market opportunity through our focus on these growth strategies we can compete for every dollar of it  and we are our people our success is dependent on contributions from xeroxs  worldwide employees who impress me every day with their passion for creating great experiences for our customers theyre led by a deeply committed executive team with a fierce will to win we have a wealth of talent across our enterprise and spend significant time developing this talent  spreading that wealth throughout our operations and preparing our next generation of leadership our recent appointment of ursula burns to president of xerox and a member of the board of directors reflects this commitment ursula joined xerox in  as an engineering intern and earned her stripes through product development and business division management roles to her most recent position as head of business group operations with full responsibility for xeroxs research and product groups through to manufacturing and distribution shes been instrumental in fine tuning xeroxs business model so were more cost competitive and accelerating our time to market with the launch of more than  products in the last three years ursula now brings her deep knowledge of our business to the president role where shell work closely with me and our leadership team to aggressively drive our welldefined growth strategy with a lot of heavy lifting behind us our operations are in good shape were now well positioned  with the best people and best products and services  to build on our momentum in the marketplace both in the near term and for your longterm investment in xerox our innovation including our partner fuji xerox we invested a combined  billion last year in research and development with a similar amount planned for  our returns on that investment are excellent last year we launched  products that together earned  industry awards we expect to more than double the number of product announcements this year we measure the success of our rd investments through a metric called time to revenue  how long it takes for new ideas to become new revenue we believe our progress in this area is among the best in the industry about twothirds of xeroxs equipment sales come from products launched in the past two years thanks to our scientists and engineers the future is bright as well last year the xerox innovation community received nearly  us utility patents thats up  percent over the previous year with our research partner fuji xerox the total was over  we hold more than  active patents many that are the foundation of breakthrough technology like  selferasable paper that uses a combination of light and ink to automatically erase marks on a page about  hours after the page is printed  eagent a special chemical ingredient that reduces the amount of energy needed to make certain xerox toners by up to  percent  advancements in natural language search technology which uses familiar phrases and sentences to simplify search results our customers one of the hallmarks of the new xerox is deep relationships with our customers increasingly we are strategic partners one of them recently referred to xerox as a combination painkiller and steroid weve been called lots of things but never that so i asked him what he meant his answer went something like this before xerox came along document management was a huge headache we had no idea what we were spending we had lots of vendors but no partners we kept investing in the promise that the next new thing would be the right thing xerox has made my life simpler i talk to one person who saves me money and boosts my productivity thats the painkiller the steroid part comes from leveraging documents to reach customers more effectively to make it easier for customers to do business with us and to grow our business thats the steroid part xerox gives me both in ways no one else can thats music to my ears its also a novel way to express our value proposition  painkiller and steroid streamlining document processes to reduce costs and leveraging documents to grow revenue no one does that better than xerox  no one our operations we also have a business model that works  in part because its flexible we react quickly and decisively to marketplace challenges and opportunities in todays world every quarter seems to present its own unique dynamics pricing pressures may put pressures on our margins economic slowdowns may slow our revenue pipeline competitive threats may cause us to bulk up our investments in marketing whatever the circumstances we adjust we do it quickly and we do it in a way that keeps our business model aligned with our financial objectives as a result we are a company that is known for consistency we know thats important to you so its critical to usour commitment

114,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2007,i am pleased to report that  was another year of steady and solid progress  a year in which we continued to strengthen the company financially invest in growth and win in the marketplaceour results included  net income of  billion  earnings per share of  which compares to  earnings per share of  on an adjusted basis our earnings per share grew  percent in   operating cash flow of  billion  total revenue of  billion an increase of  billion or  percent excluding the benefit of our acquisition of global imaging systems which we purchased in may last year revenue was up  percent in   investments in strategic acquisitions totaling  billion  and disciplined cost management that kept our gross margins and selling administrative and general costs right in line with our business model at the same time we continued to take steps to build shareholder value all the credit rating agencies rank us as investment grade we reinstated a dividend we repurchased  million in xerox stock bringing the total repurchased since  to  billion and as we entered  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  billion of xerox stock we feel good about the state of our business and we know that consistently delivering doubledigit earnings per share growth and strong operating cash flow make for the best longterm investment its a value proposition were strengthening every day the numbers as they say speak for themselves but they dont tell the entire story turnarounds are easy to track and to talk about transformations evolve more slowly and are harder to define over the past several years  step by step and brick by brick  we have built a new xerox i believe we are at an inflection point we have evolved into a servicesled technology company that is known for innovation and customer focus we help manage the massive flow of information and communication in businesses today were a content management provider and a trusted partner that can help our customers make the most of their it infrastructure and bridge the paper and digital worlds the xerox once known for copiers printers and paper has greatly expanded its footprint new technology and services offerings are generating billions of dollars in recurring revenue for us weve made some critical strategic bets in the past few years that are now differentiating xerox in the marketplace and fueling our growth we invested heavily in color determined to be the market leader we coined the term the new business of printing and vowed to bring digital technology to what was largely the province of offset or lithographic printing we also invested in technology and distribution to aggressively attack the office market and expand the business we do with small and midsize companies and we vowed to become a servicesled partner in large enterprises im not given to exaggeration or hyperbole but i feel strongly that we have achieved considerable success on all four frontsaccelerating the adoption of color weve led the transition to color from top to bottom across the markets we serve  color thats both the highest quality and highly affordable last year more than  billion pages were printed on xerox color systems thats an increase of  percent over  and way ahead of our competitors in fact according to estimates by infotrends a leading independent research firm xerox accounts for half of the total worldwide color pages printed by highspeed digital systems and for us the power really is in the pages we operate an annuitybased business with more than  percent of our total revenue coming from recurring revenue streams what we call our post sale this includes interest income from financing our customers purchases service such as technical support as well as consulting and outsourcing services and supplies like ink paper and toner the latter is why pages are so important to our business postsale revenue from color pages was up  percent yearoveryear so we know the model is working as that continues to grow so will xerox color now accounts for about  percent of our total revenue but only  percent of our total pages excluding the benefit of global imaging systems  indicating a tremendous growth opportunity that were well positioned to mine last year we shook up the marketplace by launching an office printer that makes the cost of printing a color page as affordable as black and white its the phaser  and it uses our proprietary solid ink cartridgefree technology minimizing the impact on the environment we announced  color products in  strengthening what is already the industrys broadest portfolio of digital color printing systems look for more worldclass color technology this year  technology that promises to widen our significant competitive advantage and generates the pages that boost our annuity last year more than  billion pages were printed on xerox color systems an increase of  percent and way ahead of competitors our leadership in digital highvolume printing complements traditional offset printing this market transition is the new business of printing the opportunity for digital production printing is about  billion and xeroxs advantages are the ability to print on demand produce short runs of books and customize each and every document that comes off a digital press in the new business of printing the xerox igen digital production press continues to be the star performer but it has a great supporting cast weve now installed more than  igens around the world many customers   to be precise  are printing more than a million pages a month on these marketmaking marvels perhaps the best testimony to their success is that  of our customers many of whom run commercial print shops have purchased at least two igens and have seen their business soar by offering more digital printing capabilities at the same time were seeing accelerated demand for the high end of our docucolor series and the recently launched xerox nuvera systems were going after the continuous feed market with new technology that redefines the industry standards of speed and quality and gives us a competitive advantage and were partnering with photo imaging companies to use xerox technology for printing photo applications in fact if you order a photo calendar from a retailer that works with fujifilm the calendar will be printed on a xerox press using xerox paper as xerox leads advancements in quality for digital printing the lines are blurring between the traditional photo imaging business and document processing infotrends predicts the specialty photo printing market  thats calendars greeting cards and photo books  will grow at a rate of  percent per year through  reaching  million xerox is well on its way to capturing a good share of this growthexpanding participation in smallmedium businesses we also see great opportunity in the office market where were investing heavily to win in  we launched  office products that garnered  industry awards and broadened and deepened our offerings in this highly competitive market at the same time we acquired global imaging systems which immediately put some  new sales people on the street and brought more than  new customers into the xerox fold the acquisition has exceeded our expectations and then some one year ago this billiondollar enterprise sold no xerox products by years end  percent of the document technology global imaging was selling carried the xerox brand and it is getting better every month in addition much of xeroxs  percent growth in developing markets has been fueled by small and midsize businesses smb weve been increasingly building a competitive portfolio of products and services that cater directly to the fastgrowing smb market were making inroads with todays small businesses that may be tomorrows large enterprises xerox wants to be with them every step of the way leading with services perhaps the greatest transformation has been in our services business which quietly has become an engine of growth a few facts make the point in  the value of services signings was up  percent services generated  billion in annuity revenue  up  percent over the previous year some of the most prestigious enterprises in the world  brands as diverse as united technologies hsbc nasa europart the university of california raytheon corp the united states navy and many many more  are turning to xerox for help in simplifying work processes managing their office technology around the world helping them bridge the paper and digital divide and maximizing their investments in information technology were constantly expanding our service offerings especially targeting what we call documentintensive industries that generate lots of paperwork and digital files think health care where filling out forms for each doctor visit is still the norm or the legal industry where documentation can make or break cases all these documents in any form need to be managed  scanned searched stored and more and thats where xeroxs expertise comes in we like to say that no one knows the document better than xerox the ability to manage documentintense processes has opened doors to new business and new markets and its why were investing in acquisitions that further carve out our niche in this space last year we acquired advectis inc and started xerox mortgage services which provides one of the mortgage industrys most widely used solutions for sharing electronic documents in  we acquired amici llc and launched xerox litigation services to become a leading provider of electronic discovery and document services that support legal and regulatory compliance so just about everywhere you look there are proof points that our strategy is right our execution focused and our momentum building that said xerox shareholders and the management team share a common belief as good as our progress has been its now a part of our history yesterdays accomplishments are only important insofar as they provide a bridge to tomorrows promise growing the business faster accelerating growth in a competitive environment remains a priority were not yet where we want to be key to expanding growth is expanding our distribution channels its the area of improvement where i believe we can make more progress and where we are focusing considerable time talent and resources were advantaged with a rich portfolio of technology and services the industrys smartest experts in document management and a respected brand known around the world were skilled at managing global accounts in big businesses and the commercial print market but to really ratchet up growth we need to reach even more potential customers in businesses of any size acquiring global imaging was a step in the right direction as was giving our agents and resellers access to more xerox products and packaged services to sell we need to  and we will  take this to the next level now by broadening the availability of the xerox brand through diverse direct and indirect channels to do this well were connecting even more closely with our customers predicting and responding to their needs its no secret that i spend a lot of time with customers so does my entire team some of that time is spent fixing problems and some of it selling but most of it is spent listening  really listening and when you do that you learn some pretty interesting stuff the ceos i meet with  and they are from a wide variety of industries and geographies  worry that they are not harnessing new technology to leverage growth and better serve their customers they worry about escalating costs and where to place their it investment bets so they stay ahead of the curve they see an explosion of digital information in their enterprises but are also confronted with a legacy of paper and dont know how to make sense of it all they understand the need for information to flow freely and easily throughout their organizations and around the world but worry about security breaches theyre eager to embrace the promise of a greener world but dont know how to harness technology to make their infrastructure more sustainable they are awed by the complexity and potential of technology but yearn for someone to make it all simpler and more effective heres what excites me in each of these areas  topline growth and bottomline productivity bridging the digital and paper domains making document management secure and sustainable making it decisions that provide good returns and making a complex world simple  in all these areas xerox has answers our innovation community is aligned with our strategy and is the best in our industry last year xerox was awarded  us utility patents

115,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2008,dear fellow shareholders it will come as no surprise to you that xerox shareholders have been negatively impacted by the economic crisis that has ricocheted around the world in recent months through three quarters of  we were on the path to another year of solid performance that trajectory changed dramatically in the fourth quarter one example will make the point our developing markets organization was on track to deliver another year of doubledigit revenue growth through the first three quarters of  revenue was up  percent starting in midnovember the bottom fell out with breathtaking speed resulting in a fourthquarter revenue decline of  percent in our developing marketsalthough we are hardly immune from the recessionary turmoil we are better positioned than most to navigate through it some of the sudden shift was due to a rapid decline in the russian and eastern european economies but  points of the point decline was due to major  some would say wild  shifts in currency in several developing marketstypically we manage changes in currency through pricing but this currency decline was so swift and so significant that pricing couldnt catch up i point this out not as an excuse but as an illustration of the rollercoaster nature of this economythe wonderful people i am privileged to lead at xerox are focused with passion and grit on those things we can control this attitude and focus helped us turn in credible performance in a very difficult yearalthough we are hardly immune from the recessionary turmoil we are better positioned than most to navigate through it our value proposition is supported by the strength of our financial position and the resiliency of our recurring revenue stream that is driven by installs of xerox technology and multiyear contracts for xerox services more than  percent of our revenue and  percent of our cash flow is generated from our annuitybased business model making for a solid and reliable asset especially in tough economies last year our annuity delivered  billion in revenue  up  percent from   and helped us generate more than  billion in adjusted cash from core operations  or  per share in adjusted free cash flowgiven our cash flow healthy cash balance   billion at the end of   and a  billion credit facility we remain quite confident in our financial position and have no need to access the capital markets in the foreseeable future its certainly an advantaged position in this economy although we are keenly aware that there is much we cannot control the wonderful people i am privileged to lead at xerox are focused with passion and grit on those things we can control this attitude and focus helped us turn in credible performance in a very difficult year  total revenue for  was  billion  thats an increase of  million or  percent over   fullyear net income was  million including a litigation charge excluding this and certain other charges adjusted net income was  million  we generated  million of operating cash flow adjusted cash from core operations for the year was  billion  through the  percent of our revenue invested in innovation we continued to expand our portfolio of document management technology and services  already the broadest in the industry and in our history  and we continued to expand distribution bringing the xerox brand to more businesses of any size all around the world the proof points are everywhere the highly respected gartner organization lists us as a magic quadrant market leader in managed print services as well as for printers and multifunction systems that print copy fax and scan all in one device our new offerings last year garnered some  awards from industry groups and media around the world i could go on but you get the point third parties are validating our progress and our leadership in virtually every aspect of our business thats all looking in the rearview mirror i dont have to be a psychic to know that you have little patience for that  especially in these turbulent times neither do i ive met with many investors in recent months and i keep hearing three questions asked over and over  what are you doing to confront the recession right now  what are you doing to make sure you come out of this crisis with a full head of steam  why should i continue to invest in xerox fair enough let me answer each of those questions as candidly and succinctly as i can the highly respected gartner organization lists us as a magic quadrant market leader in managed print services as well as for printers and multifunction systems actions to minimize impact of the recession we are doing everything possible to reduce cost  everything that doesnt mortgage our future we took a  million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  that has resulted in the elimination of about  jobs we expect that the restructuring will deliver  million in savings this year bonuses have been scaled back substantially and people on bonus plans will receive no salary increases this year expenses like training and travel have been significantly cut back external hiring has to be approved by me personally weve accelerated the consolidation of manufacturing facilities around the world stopped the production of products made in very low volume and consolidated operations wherever we can weve realigned our support operations  including human resources training finance and marketing  to achieve better synergy at lower cost weve streamlined product development and engineering by combining two product development organizations into one so we are taking a long list of actions aimed at getting our expenses aligned with the realities of faltering economies in just about every corner of the globe our investments over the years in lean six sigma have given us a set of tools and processes that simplify and reduce the cost of managing our global operations for us its not an event but a way of life the management team im privileged to lead is a seasoned group that knows all about belttightening and is eager to deliver the best possible shareholder value that conditions allow you place a lot of trust in us its something we take very seriously emerging with a full head of steam at the same time we are not mortgaging our future we are continuing to invest for growth and we are continuing to stick to the fundamentals  starting with listening to our customers one of the things im proudest of is the customercentric culture weve developed at xerox we have a proven track record that demonstrates that our customers increasingly see us not as a vendor but as a partnerour combination of document services affordable and innovative color technology and broader distribution to businesses of any size positions us exceptionally well to attack a  billion market heres how we provide document services that help businesses work faster and smarter with lower costs today businesses rely on us to help reduce their infrastructure costs by optimizing how they manage their document technology and handle enterprisewide printing needs also core to our document services offerings is our expertise in converting paper to digital and helping customers seamlessly track edit share and save documents in any form in a world where  trillion pages are printed each year and  billion in productivity is lost each year due to the overload of information our ability to simplify the way work gets done helps customers save up to  percent on their document management costs thats a figure that is getting more and more attention as we speak to our customers these days many of whom are looking for ways to contain cost and reduce paper that may seem counterintuitive coming from a company known for putting marks on pages but its actually a sweet spot for us especially in what we call documentintensive industries like legal healthcare financial services and education increasingly were partnering with it services companies like csc and hcl technologies to integrate our strength in document management with their capabilities in managing enterprisewide it systems and we are the preferred global imaging partner for ibm managed business process services a unit of ibm global technology services under our worldwide agreement were scanning and imaging millions of documents for ibm and their customers we provide affordable color printing systems that cut through the clutter with highimpact communications xerox continues to benefit from making color printing affordable for businesses of any size revenue from color now represents more than  percent of our total revenuethe billions of pages printed on xerox color systems grew  percent last year and total significantly more than any of our competitors in fact according to estimates by infotrends a leading independent research firm xeroxs docucolor igen and igen presses accounted for approximately onehalf of the total worldwide color pages printed by highspeed digital systems with the broadest portfolio of color printing systems on the market we continue to create new business opportunities in production printing through color technology and systems such as the xerox igen press and xerox  both of which launched in  this year well shake up the industry even more with the introduction of a color multifunction system that breaks down the cost barrier of color printing in the office through exclusive solid ink technology which not only lessens the impact on a business bottom line but also on the environmentone of the things im proudest of is the customercentric culture weve developed at xerox we have a proven track record that demonstrates that our customers increasingly see us not as a vendor but as a partner we have more distribution channels to bring xeroxs technology and services to more businesses of any size anywhere around the world for decades weve had the largest and best direct sales force in our industry currently its over  strong  one of our crown jewels and an asset that gives us a competitive advantage thats backed up by global imaging systems our whollyowned and growing network of us dealers as well as an equally impressive partnership with agents concessionaires resellers and more  giving xerox the largest broadest and most professional distribution network in our industry by acquiring nine office technology dealers in the last two years and launching  products in  designed for small and midsize businesses smb we have significantly increased our penetration in the smb marketplace in fact the number of installs for our desktop printers and multifunction systems grew  percent last year largely due to more channels selling the xerox brand our recurring revenue stream represents more than  percent of our total revenue that gives us some cushion in challenging economic times and helps fuel the  billion in cash that we expect to generate this year from core operationsbottom line yes we are feeling the impact of the recession yes we are moving aggressively to reduce costs generate cash and weather the storm but no we are neither giving up on  nor mortgaging our future by compromising on investments that will give us momentum as we come out of the economic downturn the case for xerox as an investment we firmly believe that we will navigate through this set of challenges and emerge stronger than ever i say that for several reasons we continue to enhance our leadership position in document technology last year xerox inventors earned more than  us utility patents we currently hold more than  active patents in the us and together with our research partner fuji xerox we have received over  worldwide patents in our history our research leadership yields the best and broadest set of offerings in our industry over the past three years we have launched more than  products  including  new products last year with about the same number expected this yearour distribution and services capacity is also the best and broadest in our industry through our vast and growing network of direct sales agents resellers global imaging partners and distributors we do business in over  countries this is a huge competitive advantage as customers depend on us for global account management and increasingly want to move documents around the world with speed ease and security our strategic bets in the marketplace are paying off in areas like color and document services color pages now represent  percent of total pages printed on xerox technology up from  percent in  we lead the industry in the number of color pages printed in services we generated  billion in annuity revenue last year a yearoveryear increase of  percent our recurring revenue stream represents more than  percent of our total revenue that gives us some cushion in challenging economic times and helps fuel the  billion in cash that we expect to generate this year from core operations our leadership team is battletested and resultsdriven they are an unusual mix of xerox veterans new leaders who have recently emerged from the ranks and people who joined us from other leading companies they are all driven by one goal  the success of xerox measured by the value we deliver to our shareholders last but hardly least is the quality and dedication of our workforce together with our technology and our distribution they provide the knowledge and the passion to bring value to our customers when i visit customers its our people they want to talk about customers sing the praises of xerox people and want to talk about their focus on solving problems their cando attitude and their desire to do whatever it takes to get the job done at the end of the day xerox people spell the difference between failure and success so we are feeling good about where we are there is a fair amount of disruption in our industry  some of it brought on by the economy but much of it brought on by xerox over the past few years we have upped the ante considerably on the technology we have brought to market we have both built and acquired new document services offerings and we have expanded our distribution we are proud of but not content with the competitive advantage we have created in our industry we know its a neverending battle but its one were eager to wage we feel the same way about corporate responsibility even in the worst of times we continue to make appropriate investments in the communities in which we work and live we continue to be a leader in diversity in all its forms we continue to fight for a sustainable world and a greener planet we dont have our heads in the sand about the challenges we face yet we believe we are better positioned than most to meet the obstacles that  will certainly bring our way there are likely to be winners and losers when the dust finally settles we feel confident we will be a winner ,0.23,0.0
116,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2009,dear fellow shareholders it will come as no surprise to you that  was a challenging year for businesses around the world xerox was no exception as the recession took its toll customers pulled back from making new investments in technology used their current technology less and sought to reduce spending wherever they could as a consequence total revenue for the year was  billion down  percent from the previous year to help offset this recessionary impact on revenue we focused intently on reducing costs and generating cash  taking tough actions to weather the storm while prioritizing investments to accelerate growth letter to shareholders our operational improvements along with our substantial recurring revenue stream enabled the following results  net income of  million  operating cash flow of  billion  closed the year with  billion in cash  gross margin of  percent  debt reduction of  billion  earnings per share of  cents adjusted earnings per share of  cents  better than the expectations we set in the first quarter of considering the challenges in the marketplace were especially pleased with the progress we made in delivering on our priorities of cash generation and cost and expense management this is thanks to the determination of xerox people who always stand and deliver investing in our future as proud as we are of our results in the depths of a global recession we know that we must grow revenue to build even more value for our company and for you thats why we remain sharply focused on strengthening our leadership in document management as well as significantly scaling and growing our services business among our many assets we are known for and continue to invest in three indisputable strengths our brand global presence and renowned innovation by leveraging these three pillars were expanding into more markets and creating more valuebased offerings for our clients through technology and services last year we brought to market  new products increasing what is already the industrys broadest portfolio of technology that serves businesses small to large for example our clients in the graphic arts marketplace  many of whom print for a living  are always seeking faster more productive technology so they can better serve their customers in  we announced the xerox igen  perfecting press its a digital color press that can print  impressions per minute and up to seven million impressions per month  reliable technology that works hard so our customers can profit of course xeroxs brand and technology remain prominent in workplaces of any size its been  years since we first launched the xerox  the worlds first plainpaper copier and an invention that dramatically changed the way information is shared fast forward to today and our customers still depend on xerox for document technology that does more for less the xerox colorqube does just that launched in may last year the colorqube is a game changer in our industry it cuts the cost of color pages by up to  percent compared to traditional color lasers  making it virtually the same as blackandwhite for several applications  and it prints scans faxes and copies without compromising print quality its also a good example of our focus on helping customers with their sustainability initiatives compared to traditional laser printers colorqube creates  percent less waste from supplies cuts down on storage space uses less energy produces fewer greenhouse gases and meets the us environmental protection agencys rigorous new energy star requirements as critical as our technology is so too is our distribution xerox boasts the broadest and deepest global sales network in our industry including direct sales agents and concessionaires valueadded resellers and teleweb sales during  we continued to expand our reach most notable was the acquisition of comdoc inc one of the larger independent dealers in the us our operations in the united kingdom also formed a strategic partnership with the danwood group with  sales offices danwood is the largest independent supplier of printing solutions in europe and gives us access to more customers in both the corporate and public sector you can expect more worldclass technology and innovation from xerox  this year and every year in  we received  us patents  thats a  percent increase from  and places xerox among the worlds top  corporate patent recipients add in the  us patents received by fuji xerox and our total swells to  putting xerox in the no  spot worldwidewe point this out because its critical to our future we innovate today so that we can help our customers tomorrow its at the very core of what xerox does why we have sustained our leadership in innovation for six decades and why we have been able to widen the gap against our competitors in recent years traditionally innovation in our business applies to our hardware and software technology but it also helps differentiate our service offerings and is especially relevant as we exploit the huge market opportunities in business process and it outsourcing scaling in services many of our clients are increasingly seeking service providers that offer a full range of solutions  from the management of their print services to the management of work processes in their back and front offices large enterprises also demand global capabilities and global account management and our customers are demanding more value from their technology they want their hardware investments married with software and they want total packages that solve a problem cut their costs simplify the way they get work done  or a combination of all three we understand these marketplace dynamics very well instead of watching them play out in front of us we knew the better approach was to become a bigger broader player in the game the reason is clear in a mature hardware technology market the larger growth opportunity is in services services is a broadly defined word as we look at it in our document management business services comprise both the technical support of our equipment and as important the software and outsourcing that relate to workflow in a business for example through our enterprise print services we help customers save up to  percent on their document costs by managing all the devices in their workplaces  regardless of manufacturer  and by handling the supplies maintenance and support that go along with them its important to note that we continue to be positioned by gartner inc in the leaders quadrant in the magic quadrant for managed print services worldwide  meaningful industry recognition that reflects our strong leadership in this growing business so in scaling our services business we started with following the document where we have knowledge and expertise that no one else can match that focus led us quite naturally to business process outsourcing bpo most business processes are driven by documents which gives us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves from competitors  most of whom are it providers thats a big deal for us think about it bpo is all about taking timeconsuming operations and either automating them andor finding more productive ways to do them manually healthcare is a good example if youve been to a doctor or hospital recently you know that the industry is still paperdependent in many cases bpo providers are working behind the scenes keeping the paper flowing and getting it where it needs to be  producing hard copies converting paper to digital distributing forms processing payments and so on the same is true in many other facets of our daily lives  mortgage applications credit card processing benefits forms insurance claims and on and on we know how to apply document software such as advancements in redaction and categorization to make these processes more efficient and effective thats why bpo became the logical and natural next step for xerox with a bpo business we extend our global participation in vertical markets  like healthcare transportation and financial services and we participate in a more diversified and fastergrowing market that holds up well in any economy nowhere was this strategy more visible than in our acquisition of affiliated computer services acs completed in february of  xeroxs acquisition of acs significantly strengthens our financial position and enables us to take a quantum leap forward in expanding our already growing services business it puts an emphatic exclamation point on our drive to transform our company growth is certainly at the center of this transformation while perhaps not a familiar name in the marketplace acs touches millions of lives everyday consider this acs which is now a xerox company  provides services to more than  federal state county and local governments making acs the largest provider of managed services to government entities in the united states  processes about  billion in electronic toll collections every year  handles more than  million phone calls daily in  customer care centers  manages more than  million student loans worth  billion  provides hr services for more than  million employees and retirees annually strategically and financially extending our global brand into business process outsourcing is all about growth acceleration and value creation  more value for our customers through a broader set of technology and services offerings and more sustainable value for our shareholders by strengthening our financial profile in fact the benefits to our business are immediate including  giving us scale and leadership in business process outsourcing a market that is growing at a rate of  percent per year  increasing our already strong free cash flow  which is expected to exceed  billion per year or more than  percent of annual revenue  strengthening our annuitybased business model through multiyear service contracts for bpo and document management xeroxs recurring revenue will represent  percent of total revenue  enhancing our profitable revenue growth through cost and revenue synergies we expect to increase our operating margin by  percent per year through  which will expand earnings by  to  percent the acquisition would not have been possible without the approval of xerox shareholders who voted overwhelmingly for it in fact more than  percent of the votes cast gave us the green light we cant tell you how gratifying that is and we are committed to giving you a good return on this investment xerox people our greatest asset we are feeling good about where we are and where were heading much of our optimism comes from the investments we have made but much of it comes also from the caliber and commitment of xerox people we both spend a lot of time with xerox customers wherever we go around the world our customers sing the praises of xerox people they are our competitive advantage last year our people received more than  awards they were won by xerox people in every corner of the globe and they were given for our innovation technology products and services for our leadership in diversity sustainability corporate responsibility and community involvement for being wellmanaged using lean six sigma exceptionally well exhibiting a strong sense of values and ethics and being a good place to work one award was especially gratifying jd power and associates recognized xerox for providing an outstanding customer service experience this is the fourth consecutive year that xerox people have been awarded this coveted distinction awards like these confirm what we already know  that we are privileged to lead a wonderful group of people its a responsibility we take quite seriously and its one of the key reasons we so carefully planned the transition of one chief executive officer to another that took place on july   the transition was smooth and natural as we knew it would be  another sign of the values and culture of this special company despite the recession and its impact on our revenue we exceeded our financial expectations in most respects last year and generated  billion in operating cash we brought a new array of technology to market we increased our distribution to bring the xerox brand to more businesses of any size in more places around the world we announced the acs acquisition significantly expanding our portfolio of services and we had a seamless transfer of leadership at the helmready for real business as we look at the dynamics of the markets we serve and understand deeply the challenges our customers face the value proposition that xerox offers becomes clearer every day we know that the one thing that is predictable about business is that it is fundamentally unpredictable successful businesses navigate through this unpredictability by making sure the technology software and business processes that form the backbone of their organizations are operating as effectively and efficiently as possible no one understands this better than xerox we have the technology and services to take on all our clients essential business processes giving them the freedom to focus on what matters most their real business its a powerful statement and one that defines and differentiates our new company xerox is now a  billion firm that is the worlds leading global enterprise for business process and document management with our strong leadership in document technology services and bpo we are a major player in a  billion market  thats four times the size of the market we traditionally have been a part of  and its a market that is growing by more than  percent per year through our strong will to win we are aggressively pursuing more than our fair share of this sizable growth opportunitywe know we speak for all xerox people now  strong when we say that we are ready for real business  for growing our business and for creating value for our customers and our shareholders we take those obligations very seriously in a world of uncertainty you can count on at least one thing  we will do everything in our power to give you a good return on your investment thats a promise,0.485,1.0
117,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2010,dear fellow shareholders i am pleased to report that  was a year of both steady progress and historic transformation for xerox our results speak to the strength of our business model the expanding value we bring to our customers our growing distribution capability and the determination of our people to do what it takes to give you a good return on the trust you place in us here is a summary of how we performed in   we delivered adjusted earnings per share of  cents for the year  well ahead of our expectations as we entered   total revenue was  billion  up  percent on a proforma basis  we generated a very substantial  billion in cash from operations  from the time we acquired affiliated computer services acs in february we reduced debt by  billion  our operating margin for the year was  percent  an improvement of one percentage point over the previous year on a proforma basis these are the basic facts but they dont begin to tell the whole story when the history of xerox for this decade is written i have no doubt that  will be viewed as a pivotal time many businesses talk about transformation were actually doing it through last years acquisition of affiliated computer services our significant expansion into services and our expanding distribution capacity xerox is now the worlds leading enterprise for business process and document management the new xerox most of you know us best for our world leadership in document technology and services  printers multifunction devices copiers production publishing systems managed print services and related software and solutions were proud of that heritage and we continue to build on it today and now we are also a leader in business process and it outsourcing we offer our customers a wide variety of global services that may surprise you  from claims reimbursement and electronic toll transactions to the management of hr benefits and customer care centers think of the modernday enterprise as a multistory office building with it occupying one floor customer care on another hr on top of that and then finance and accounting on another you might just find the new xerox on any one or all of these floors using our expertise in business process and it outsourcing to work behind the scenes to make it all operate more efficiently and more effectively and if you think of a vertical column running the height of the building that would be our document management capability supporting every facet of the enterprise many of these functions and operations require expertise most companies dont have and time most companies dont want to invest its not their real business by outsourcing it to xerox our clients have more freedom to focus on what counts their core business their real business and we do it in such a way that our customers save money and improve productivity by taking advantage of the scale speed and simplification that comes from our advantaged technology and expertise in managing basic and complex business functions as a result xerox is now in places you may not expect to see us and still in places that are a natural fit with our technology  all indicative of our transforming business and our exciting future here are a few examples of what i mean   italia the italian global media company turned to xerox to provide superior customer care services for nine million customers  italia joins a long list of customers who use our services in industries ranging from hightech to aviation with more than  customer care agents in  customer care centers around the world we handle more than one million customer transactions every day  and we do it in  different languagesthe state of wisconsin signed an eightyear  million contract to have xerox continue handling the states childsupport payment processing operations  including processing and disbursing payments performing bank reconciliation and managing a customer service call center all  states have contracts with us for a variety of business processing and other services that include child support food stamps medicaid disability health and welfare  fiat group signed a fiveyear contract for xerox to manage its print infrastructure companywide expected results include a  percent reduction in printrelated cost and a  percent reduction in energy use fiat joins other xerox customers for managed print services like the dow chemical company ingersoll rand and hundreds more  transit riders in denver will notice a faster more efficient and greener experience as the city implements an advanced fare collection system managed by xerox as part of a fouryear  million contract public transportation users will receive smart cards load them with a prepaid amount and simply wave the smart card in front of a scanner to gain access to the transit system we do this and similar applications  like ezpass  for scores of municipalities  more than  procter  gamble employees will soon be able to print emails presentations and other business documents directly from their smart phones its all part of a much broader enterprise print services strategy managed by xerox for pg around the world its credited with driving cost down and productivity up while helping the company meet its aggressive sustainability goals  aspen marketing the largest privately held marketing services company in the united states uses our digital technology  including xerox igen presses docutech highlight color systems xerox freeflow web services and xmpie personaleffect crossmedia solution  to help auto dealerships increase floor traffic and grow revenue from maintenance services theyre promoting client loyalty through personalized directmarketing materials such as postcards letters and invitations  the scotts miraclegro company the industryleading lawn and garden care company turned to xerox for help on upgrading its it infrastructure across europe the country overhaul was accomplished in four months while reducing costs improving performance and embedding better innovation  to maximize roi on its k plan a global defense and technology giant asked xerox to design and implement a communication campaign to educate employees about the importance of saving for retirement the results increased employee participation rates increased contribution rates and improved asset allocation  and of course were using acs ourselves to run some of our own backoffice operations such as hr benefits processing and accounts payable multiply those examples by thousands more and you begin to see the scope and scale of our company  and the extraordinary opportunities for growth growth opportunities with the building of our services business alongside our technology business the size of the market we address has grown exponentially our traditional technologydriven market is valued at about  billion and is relatively flat but we now participate in two additional markets  business process outsourcing which is currently valued at over  billion and is growing at over  percent per year  information technology outsourcing which is currently valued at  billion a year and is growing at over  percent per year in total thats a more than  billion market  more than three times our traditional opportunity were attacking it aggressively on four fronts first were accelerating the transition to color until recently the barrier to color everywhere has been cost that barrier was broken first in the home with the advent of affordable color inkjet printers now were breaking the cost barrier in office and production environments with our advantaged solid ink technology for some applications a color page is already priced the same as a blackandwhite one we have our eyes wide open to the trends in the marketplace around a declining use of paper for transactional blackandwhite documents a good example is all those bill statements that used to be mailed hardcopy every month and are now distributed by email if you looked around most offices these days youd be convinced that paper is never really going away that may be true but the way we use paper is changing and our dependency on it is declining the highervalue print communications are those produced in color  photo books marketing collaterals direct mailers and packaging and those printed in color with messages customized for the individual cut through clutter in ways that no electronic communication ever can thats why our investments in printing are focused entirely on breaking the cost barriers in color and advancing digital technology for the creation of realtime relevant personalized communications to that end heres another unexpected place youll find xerox today mediaware digital is a leading provider of digitally printed packaging it depends on xeroxs automated packaging solution to produce the packaging for microsofts windows  its a good example of how our printing business has expanded way beyond putting marks on a sheet of paper  and why our technology is needed and remains relevant well into the future second were expanding our distribution we already have the industrys broadest distribution to large enterprises and we continue to increase our distribution capacity to small and midsize businesses we understand that in todays world people buy and engage in a variety of ways weve moved aggressively in recent years to both strengthen the distribution channels we have and acquire the new channels we need one great move by xerox was the acquisition of global imaging systems a few years ago the gis network of  core companies gave us an additional  feet on the street weve since expanded our distribution even more with acquisitions in key us markets and in the netherlands you can expect to see us do more of the same  growing our network of channels so more people are on more streets selling more xerox technology and services third were extending our lead in document outsourcing were the acknowledged leader and intend to keep it that way our value proposition is simple we can do your document management more efficiently and at less cost than you can do it yourself in todays world thats a powerful statement and it removes one more distraction from our clients desire to focus on their core business although it may seem counterintuitive coming from xerox we almost always help our customers print less thereby saving them money and helping them minimize their impact on the environment one example at procter  gamble we consolidated all the devices it used for printing copying scanning and faxing into a more manageable and costefficient network of multifunction systems the managed print services we provide to pg has enabled it to print eight million fewer pages and reduce printrelated energy by  percent fourth were expanding our business process and it outsourcing businesses globally our acquisition of acs was largely based on our confidence in the significant services growth opportunity over  percent of the acs business is currently in the united states our global strength and brand awareness give acs the capability and permission to expand into markets around the world  often growing our business with existing xerox clients our innovation in areas like advanced imaging and data analysis gives us an advantage in how we serve our clients  more ways of automating typically manual processes and more ways to simplify often complex document and dataintensive transactions like claims reimbursement and invoice processing our expertise in creating cloudbased platforms for these services and our extensive experience in labor management for delivering quality support become key differentiators for xerox and position us incredibly well for longterm growthone very positive sign last year we developed a services pipeline of more than  billion in business that neither xerox nor acs could have signed without the value the other brought to the table so we do not want for opportunity i have great confidence in our value proposition and in the technology and talent we have to deliver it and thats a very good place to be renowned innovation this company was built on innovation which remains central to our strategy today if you could look under the hood of our rd labs around the world you would probably be surprised at what you would find you would see work that is stretching the boundaries of what is possible in digital printing of course but you would also find in at least equal measure work on intuitive data analysis and a variety of green technologies to make business processes more sustainable in other words you would see innovation that reflects the new xerox one measure of how well we are doing is the number of patents our innovators are awarded last year that number was   up  percent from  that would rank us in the top  companies last years patents included innovations to improve inventory management email overload and personalized packaging other patents help manage documents and make sense out of large collections of information our real business sound strategy and effective execution we now have two distinct yet synergistic business segments  technology and services this gives us a steady mix of annuity revenue in technology it comes from service and supplies in services it comes from multiyear outsourcing contracts together they account for more than  percent of our total revenue  a very attractive feature of our business model by the way annuity revenue in  on a proforma basis was up  percent without the impact of currency  in technology our annuity stream is fueled by the sales of xerox equipment last year equipment sales were up a significant  percent without the impact of currency  that growth reflected both strong demand for new products and expanded distribution coverage around the world the combination positioned us extraordinarily well to take advantage of an improving economy and the willingness for customers to begin investing in technology just as our annuity revenue is fueled by equipment sales our equipment sales are fueled by a steady stream of new products during  we launched  products with an emphasis on maintaining our leadership in both the production and office markets big contributors to equipment sales growth in  were the xerox color  and  series as well as the colorqube family of multifunction systems which uses our proprietary solid ink technology total color revenue for the year was up  percent without the impact of currency and color pages were up  percent  strong signs that our color strategy is on track while our services business received a major power surge with the acquisition of acs this part of our business has been evolving for a very long time by the time we acquired acs one year ago we already had over a  billion services business  some of it through organic growth and some of it through smaller acquisitions the acs deal was a logical  albeit bold  leap forward overnight we became a  billion services business yearoveryear our revenue from services was up  percent on a proforma basis and indicators for future revenues remain strong business signings were up about  percent on a trailing month basis so positive results in both technology and services good opportunities going forward and a team that is focused on excellent execution delivering shareholder value in  we grew adjusted earnings increased revenue improved operating margin and generated  billion in cash we delivered on our commitments across the board and by doing so we created greater value for our shareholders that was then this is now we enter  with building momentum and heightened confidence i dont know that anyone has the hubris to predict with any certainty what the postrecession business climate will be like but i do know this  businesses and governments large and small will continue to struggle to contain costs operate more efficiently grow revenue and build better client relationships in other words they will want to go about their real business and xerox is ready to help them were confident but not complacent were differentiated in the marketplace through our worldclass innovation and renowned service we operate in some  countries and thats becoming more and more important to our larger customers who are looking for global solutions our worldclass brand gives us a high degree of trust that helps us open doors and build relationships were relevant to our customers who rely on us to make them better our business model has been tested under the most trying conditions the past few years and proven to be both resilient and flexible we are focused on the basics  containing cost generating cash growing revenue and providing you with good returns our  priorities and plans keep us on track to grow revenue generate significant cash and expand earnings we wont compromise our leadership position or give an inch in document technology by continuing to expand distribution well increase install activity and equipment sales  with an emphasis on driving color pages that help boost our annuity stream well continue to grow our services business by leveraging our brand global scale innovation and delivery platforms to win multimilliondollar deals in business process it and document outsourcing well remain diligent on cost and expense management capturing key cost synergies from the acs acquisition and driving efficiencies and productivity across the enterprise well continue to focus on generating free cash flow  about  billion of it  all the while reducing debt delivering dividends closing on tuckin acquisitions and allotting a significant portion of available cash to repurchasing stock we are now  people strong doing business in  countries and all with an overreaching mission of delivering value to our customers and our shareholders im confident we have the right strategy a sound business model the competitive strength a seasoned leadership team talented people and the discipline and focus to put it all together for you in  this is our real business

118,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2011,the one thing thats predictable about business is that its fundamentally unpredictable its constantly changing  by chance and by design and macro forces bring new challenges every day this was certainly the case in   a pivotal year of transformation for our business and a year when  all said and done  xerox people delivered solid financial results made measured progress and continued to build our company into the worlds leading enterprise for business process and document management here is a brief summary of how we performed  we delivered adjusted earnings per share of   up  percent over the previous year  total revenue for the full year was  billion  up two percent proforma  we generated  billion in cash from operations  adjusted net income of  billion was up  percent  we resumed our share repurchase program in  and made a sizable investment in it as well as paying  million in dividends  tangible signs of our commitment to return value to our shareholders delivering on commitments throughout the year our business faced challenges stemming from global economic uncertainty as well as the impact on our supply chain from the earthquake in japan despite these pressures im pleased with our  results but far from satisfied im impatient by nature and therefore very focused on speeding up our progress as a company were doing this through the following strategies while the statements themselves seem relatively simple the complexity is in the detail and our priorities are clearly centered on the implementation first accelerating our services business we set out to grow services faster by diversifying our offerings and expanding globally more of our total revenue now comes from services than technology in  revenue from services grew six percent proforma  and through expanded sales activities we won a considerable amount of new business  increasing our new business signings by  percentsecond maintaining our leadership in document technology we not only continue to hold our numberone equipment revenue market share position but we also grew share in  we did this by offering a more extensive and affordable portfolio of color products and by expanding our distribution to serve more small and midsize businesses around the world third managing our business with a disciplined focus on operational excellence this gives us the financial flexibility to help offset certain pressures on the business  whether its economic uncertainty or necessary investments that drive growth either way  and despite challenges thrown our way  our focus is on delivering strong bottomline results were justifiably proud that we do this very well fourth the bottom line for xerox shareholders  expanding earnings and returning value to all of you by executing well on the first three priorities we delivered on the fourth fullyear  adjusted earnings per share grew  percent  we generated  billion in operating cash flow and repurchased a significant number of xerox shares during the year so good results and theyre evidence of a company that is financially sound delivering consistent doubledigit earnings growth and applying operational excellence to navigate that unpredictability most companies face but as i mentioned previously im not satisfied  and i wont be until we grow revenue faster in  revenue was hampered by macro conditions but we didnt let the headwinds that pressured our topline performance disrupt our ability to deliver strong bottomline results that said ratcheting revenue is a necessity for the sustainable strength of our business i have great confidence in our growth potential and i can assure you the xerox team is taking a targeted approach to capture the rich opportunity in front of us transformation of xerox changes are taking place in our heartland industry of document technology we wont see a paperless office anytime soon but we are seeing less reliance on paper in our daily lives both at work and at home one example i often use because everybody gets it is bank statements credit card bills and things of that sort most of you likely now receive your bill statements online instead of paper statements in the mail and youre probably paying for those bills online too somewhere in that transactional process xerox is very likely behind the scenes making it happen thats because we didnt resist whats been taking place in our industry and we didnt stick our heads in the sand to avoid seeing the changes we have had our eyes wide open embraced the changes and in many cases led them in fact we started to transform our company more than a decade ago once synonymous with copying and then printing some of you might recall we began referring to ourselves as the document company  a signal that we had expertise in paper and digital documents and a sweet spot in helping customers navigate seamlessly between both worlds we started to make niche acquisitions that enabled us to handle digital discovery for lawyers electronic mortgage applications for banks and others the more we did the more our customers wanted thats a great place to be  a window of opportunity that doesnt come often as you know we leapt at the opportunity two years ago we acquired affiliated computer services acs a major player in the business process and it outsourcing market overnight our  billion services business became a  billion business and through our growth in this area revenue from services now represents the largest portion of our business as i like to point out lots of companies talk about transformation were doing it since acquiring acs ive done a lot of reflecting on how it has changed our company two paradoxical thoughts keep coming back to me one is that the more things change the more they stay the same from our earliest days our purpose was never about making copies it was about making it easier for people to share information chester carlson the inventor of xerography said as much when he described his goal as making office work a little simpler a little less tedious and a little more productive making things simpler has always been in our dna when you walk up to a xerox device then as now you select your features push a button and a lot of very complex technology takes over  technology the customer doesnt care too much about or need to know about by the way much the same is true of the acs tradition  a company that was built over time on the premise that being exceptionally good at backoffice work gave its clients one less thing to worry aboutas xerox and acs became one i believe our founders would be pleased that at the core our purpose has not shifted far from our legacies  doing things behind the curtain to simplify the ways work gets done thats what i mean when i say that the more things change the more they stay the same in some fundamental ways relevant value proposition the other thought i keep coming back to is how relevant the new xerox has become with our value proposition as the worlds leading enterprise for business process and document management we free companies to be the best at what they do when i meet with my peers in business and governments around the world a handful of concerns keep repeating themselves first everything about their operations is in a state of flux change even chaos is the norm backoffice operations are seen as necessary but not a core competency enterprises know they are essential but dont want to expend energy and resources on them that can be better used elsewhere thats why more and more organizations  business and government big and small  are turning to partners who know how to run big complex business processes flawlessly and efficiently i think you would be amazed at both the breadth and depth of the business processes we design and operate  customer call centers accounts payable and receivable hr benefits programs it infrastructure and networks health information exchanges redlight cameras for traffic violations and so much more klm royal dutch airlines and other airlines asked us to convert their paper tickets to an electronic format streamlining the process and delivering a  percent reduction in turnaround time in other words they want business partners like xerox we have the deep knowledge the innovative approach and the operational excellence that drive down cost and take the worry off the shoulders of our customers i think you would be amazed at both the breadth and depth of the business processes we design and operate  customer call centers accounts payable and receivable hr benefits programs it infrastructure and networks health information exchanges redlight cameras for traffic violations and so much more were the company you encounter every day and never see for example klm royal dutch airlines and other airlines asked us to convert their paper tickets to an electronic format streamlining the process and delivering a  percent reduction in turnaround timea second concern that customers keep bringing up is one everyone can relate to  information overload we all deal with mountains of information some of its on paper some is digital and its all coming at us at dizzying speed and greater volume than ever clients cant be bothered with thinking about the problem let alone addressing it they want partners who can speed up and simplify access to information and data and make it all affordable in other words they want partners like xerox we have unmatched capabilities expertise technology and services to manage the flow of information and bridge the divide between paper and digital  simply and affordably in most cases we even save customers money make their lives simpler and make the earth greener for example at medco were developing and managing a multichannel platform that lets medcos  million members personalize how they receive information from the company  via hardcopy statements secure website email text messages or a combination of all these channels a related issue is the difficulty clients have in finding and using data as one of my friends is fond of saying i save everything and can find nothing she voices a common issue information is everywhere  on paper online in photos on servers on the desktop in file drawers in smartphones and now in the cloud there are all sorts of issues that come with the volume of information  privacy access retrieval and storage to name a few the customers i meet know they have both a problem and a lost opportunity whoever said information is power had it right customers yearn for partners who can take those streams of data and mountains of information and harness them to create value customers want someone to make sure theyre making the right investments to help them find what they want when they want they want to turn information from a liability into an asset in other words they want partners like xerox we are expert at protecting client privacy mining data for competitive advantage and improved customer service and getting just the right piece of information or insight to just the right person just when they need it in the world of information were the justintime people for example were using data from traffic and parking patterns to help the city of los angeles turn parking into a smart analyticsbased business electronic street signs and smartphone apps direct drivers to available spaces in real time fees for parking vary by demand as a way of directing more people to mass transit during peak rush hours its a smart way to use information that results in a simpler way for people to get around and its xerox innovation  much of which was developed at our research centers in france and palo alto  at its very best and the last question that is on the minds of business leaders  but interestingly is never directly asked  is this is this a company i want to do business with there are a lot of important questions behind that basic one customers want to know youll be fair and honest that youre reliable and wont let them down that youll continue to innovate and bring them best practices that the values of the company speak to things that are important to them in other words they want partners like xerox customers have choices on who gets their business trusting some of your most critical operational processes to a business partner is a highstakes game were staffing call centers on behalf of our customers paying bills and transacting payments on their behalf managing it infrastructures on their behalf creating sophisticated electronic medical records on their behalf processing insurance claims on their behalf creating and distributing client communication on their behalf considering these responsibilities

mission to take some very complex business processes and make them simple for those who need them weve become a critical enabler for business and government when you speak with leaders in the public

119,Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2012,dear fellow shareholders this report is filled with numbers in our big data world numbers speak volumes about results they influence your investment decisions and they influence the way we run our business im an engineer by training and lead with a strong passion for our brand and an obsession with the numbers that indicate our progress were a company going through considerable change at a time when economies are uncertain the markets we serve are shifting and our always on connected world requires a faster pace and a more competitive edge to win numbers keep me grounded they provide clarity of where weve been and where were headed heres a glimpse of what i mean  percent of our revenue now comes from services while our brand is still associated with our heritage in copying and printing today more than half of our business is linked to a diverse portfolio of outsourcing services including customer care likely even for the company who makes your smartphone healthcare claims reimbursement likely for your private insurance company and automated tolling and parking transactions think ez pass and then think how long commutes would be without it  percent of xeroxs revenue is annuity based thats  billion in revenue a stable less volatile base  billion in operating cash flow which reflects the cashgenerating strength of this annuitybased business model # worldwide revenue market share leadership for our document technology this speaks to the continued power of the xerox brand in a market that we created and continue to benefit from through healthy margins and established relationships in  countries  thats the total number of patents garnered by xerox along with our colleagues at the palo alto research center and at fuji xerox last year alone bringing to more than  the number of active letter to shareholders us patents in our portfolio this year october  to be exact marks the th anniversary of when chester carlson made the first xerographic image in his lab in new york city his humble ways of applying innovation to more easily share information continue to be a source of inspiration for our research community and remarkably  years later our innovation focus remains very true to chesters  finding smarter ways to strip away complexity and simplify how work gets done these numbers are a big part of todays xerox were evolving every day from the wellestablished copier company to the worlds leading enterprise for business process and document management our transformation comes with its share of challenges in  we continued to face them head on  prioritizing where we needed to make improvement and executing with precision to deliver we made progress in some areas the progress isnt fast enough for me for example as we ramp up growth in our services business we must also improve our services operating margin that means being more disciplined in how we execute large contracts so were applying innovation and identifying efficient ways to serve our clients better we increased margins in the fourth quarter of   and i expect that the benefits of our operational focus in this area will deliver continued improvement going forward despite the economic headwinds we faced last year i believe we can improve revenue trends in our document technology business we understand the market dynamics know the pressure points and can identify where weakness is due to economy and where weakness is due to secular concerns we are also clear eyed on areas of greatest growth potential  like in color printing and reaching more small and midsize businesses around the world last year we were conservative in the way we managed our document technology business due to the economic uncertainty across most regions we put our focus on reducing the cost base while expanding distribution through indirect channels this year were ramping up marketing investments and introducing new offerings while broadening our channel partnerships  positioning us better to pursue profitable opportunities so although  presented our business with some obstacles we moved forward in refining our business model improving operational efficiency and growing our services business  all while delivering value to you heres a summary of how we performed  net income of  billion adjusted net income of  billion  gaap earnings per share of  cents adjusted earnings per share of   total revenue of  billion down  percent or flat in constant currency from  total services revenue of  billion up  percent or up  percent in constant currency total document technology revenue of  billion down  percent or down  percent in constant currency  operating margin of  percent  operating cash flow of  billion  share repurchase of  billion and  million in dividends priorities drive performance we participate in a  billion market and we continue to tackle it aggressively on four fronts first managing our services business for growth i mentioned earlier that revenue from our services business is now more than half of our total revenue and is growing at a steady pace we expect it will grow to twothirds of our revenue by  my confidence in the longterm success of our services business stems from the diversity of our offerings and the deep expertise weve established to work closely with clients on their important business processes  when a major automobile company selected xerox to handle their employee benefits program we were able to build manage and support their open enrollment process in a matter of months  just as a telecommunications company decided to start selling their new product in brazil they tapped us to open staff and lead their incountry customer care service  as soon as the affordable care act in the united states became more of a certainty for state governments several of our government clients looked to us for help establishing health insurance exchanges and strengthening the administrative backbone of their medicaid and other health and welfare programs i could go on but the bottom line is that our services business will continue to grow because of the breadth and depth of our offerings and more important because of our respected experience innovation and expertise that wins us trust from our clients that trust helped us sign new contracts during  worth more than  billion in annual revenue and to win  percent of the contracts that were up for renewal during the year its trust we never take for granted second maintaining our leadership in document technology print is changing but it is far from dead where transactional blackandwhite documents are in decline color printing in offices and graphic communications settings is growing  and not surprising is an area of strength for our business we offer the industrys broadest range of color printing technology to serve small offices all the way up to large production houses you may no longer use inkjet printers in your home thats ok with me its not the business were in but in offices and print shops our color technology is in demand and has resulted in pages on color devices growing  percent in  through an expanded network of channel partners were now able to bring the xerox brand to more establishments around the globe third managing our business with a focus on operational excellence this is something were very proficient at today and its an area where we never rest it gives us the financial flexibility to help offset certain pressures on the business  whether its economic uncertainty or necessary investments that drive growth we continue to invest in what matters to our customers including highvalue scalable products and unrivalled service and delivery that earn customer loyalty fourth delivering strong cash flow and returning value to you by executing with precision and excellence on the first three priorities we delivered on the fourth we generated  billion in operating cash flow in  and allocated  billion of that cash to buy back a significant number of xerox shares during the year in addition we paid out  million in dividends during the year you expect and deserve a strong return on your investment in xerox and we owe you nothing less so thats our story solid results in a challenging environment  a robust strategy for an expanding market opportunity  and a clear set of priorities aimed at creating value for all of our constituents but thats only part of the story heres the rest creating customer value i spend a lot of my time meeting with customers learning about their business problems and trying to explain to them that we can help just a few years ago that was a tough sell the xerox brand is powerful but for many it stood for superior document technology period talking to our customers about our services offerings was often met with is that what xerox does that has changed  partly because of our marketing efforts and partly because of the pervasiveness of our footprint today i can tell customers that we handle  billion in accounts payables annually answer  million customer interactions daily manage benefits for more than  million employees process  million insurance claims every year collect  billion transit fares annually reduce documentrelated costs for enterprises large and small by up to  percent and a whole lot more sustainable strategy i was speaking with students recently at nyu polytechnic my undergraduate alma mater when a student asked me what xerox might look like five years from now the world is changing at such a dramatic pace that i imagine a lot of ceos might have a difficult time answering that question frankly i didnt thats because our strategy is built to evolve we continue to invest heavily in innovation and to work with our customers to understand their changing needs although i cant tell you how we will be solving their business process problems five years out i can tell you that we will continue to simplify the way their backoffice work gets done while boosting productivity and reducing costs weve been at this for a very long time  ever since chester carlson set out to make office work a little easier its a journey toward a neverending goal of making things simpler for our customers so they can focus on what matters most thats what well be doing five years from now and likely  years from now as well to that end the team at xerox and i are bullish about the future we know therell be hurdles to overcome we know where we can improve but we also know well stay focused impatient with the status quo and hungry for greater success so this is a good time to keep your eye on xerox heres why  servicesled growth  profitable leadership from document technology  cashgenerating annuitybased business model  consistent earnings expansion and  financial strength to invest in building value for xerox and building value for you and of course well be doing all this with a passion for helping our customers succeed a thirst for innovation a respect for our peopleand our commitment to help them grow a deep desire to make our communities and our planet always better than they are

strategically to help the world tackle some daunting and complex tasks its a noble mission and part of the xerox heritage it may surprise you to know that the man who invented xerography  years ago had the same objective in  a patent attorney named chester carlson created an easier way to duplicate information on paper after spending countless hours in the new york public library handwriting copies of materials he needed he was determined to find a way to make office work a little more productive and a little less tedious his invention later named xerography gave birth to xerox and revolutionized how information is shared ultimately simplifying how office work gets done seventyfive years later chesters vision lives on in every aspect of todays xerox and has led us on a journey to innovate ways to simplify complex and tedious work to that end todays xerox provides not only the worldclass document technology you would expect but also a deep and broad array of business process

services revenue of  billion up  percent  total document technology revenue of  billion down  percent  operating margin of  percent  operating cash flow of  billion at the same time we continued to take steps to build shareholder value in  we returned nearly  billion to you through  million of share repurchases and almost  million in dividends last year we increased our common stock dividend by

139,United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2004,by conventional standards of measurement unitedhealth group achieved strong performance across its diverse set of businesses in  but as important as financial results are they alone do not fully convey the tangible advances in our efforts to promote optimal health for all people perhaps most gratifying is the measurable progress unitedhealth group continues to make toward addressing key challenges in health care this is being realized by marshaling unparalleled capabilities in organizing resources developing and applying technology and using data to enhance knowledge across a diverse set of markets the strategic focus of our company which has remained unchanged for more than a decade and a half centers on making the health care system  a system rich in capability but consistently inefficient variable in its results and challenging in its accessibility  work better over these years we have held fast to our key beliefs in offering choice and access simplifying the health care experience promoting safe and evidencebased medicine facilitating care for people and ultimately improving affordability these core principles and elements  focused on the needs of the marketplace rather than a particular product or capability  have served as our impetus to pursue innovations and opportunities across the full spectrum of the health and wellbeing arena in so doing we have had a meaningful impact on advancing health and wellbeing for the constituencies we serve the shared commitment of our employees regardless of individual responsibilities or involvement in a particular business unit is that in everything we do we must ultimately address the basic needs of our customers more than ever we are committed to making the needs of customers our priority and to further act on what we have long believed while these objectives have been present in the past we have refined our focus around four imperatives our individual and collective activities will be relentlessly directed at achieving  higher quality and better health outcomes  affordability of services  accessibility to care and  ease of use of benefits and services by addressing these fundamental needs and thereby excluding all other distractions and activities that do not align with these imperatives we effectively dedicate our resources and capabilities to the needs of our customers and in turn help create a more efficient progressive fair and compassionate health care system for everyone our efforts to date have been fruitful we have succeeded in meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse set of clients and market segments and this has allowed us to provide meaningful advances for our shareholders as well  strong revenue growth has been driven by an expanding customer base which has accessed both new and established services  health care cost trends have been contained through an array of services and programs designed to reduce inappropriate variation in care increase the use of necessary services and more effectively purchase services critical to those in need  operating margins have continued to expand as gains from the practical application of technology have increased service quality and efficiency and simultaneously lowered costs  strong cash flows from operations have been generated by attention to best business practices we have effectively utilized these strong cash resources to support operations fund research and development activities invest in innovations for the future and support worthy social activities  documented by the companys strong return on equity business expansion and continuing growththese results aside it remains our belief that health care must work better should be easier and simpler to use and must be accessible for all people as a society and a nation we have not worked hard enough on this agenda our aspirations and actions are too modest and our pace lacks appropriate urgency given the costs in both human suffering and the national economic resources we currently expend we believe the efforts of unitedhealth group and others are important to meeting the broad challenges related to health and wellbeing that affect our society as well as those beyond our domestic borders certainly our company alone cannot solve the significant issues surrounding health care for all citizens that will require mutual participation by all parties involved in health care particularly physicians and other providers of care employers government intermediaries and consumers while we urge these collective efforts to accelerate we will move ahead with urgency unitedhealth group has been  and will continue to be  an important innovator and advocate for addressing the issues of quality affordability accessibility and usability in health care given our position and the potential before us we are optimistic about the future we have the tools the capacity the desire and above all the commitment of our people innovations services and products from unitedhealth group have provided meaningful value to people across a broad set of healthrelated needs we intend

annually while our nation has long excelled in important aspects of modern medical care  the resources to treat complex diseases or to respond to critical health events are among the best in the world  in other areas of our health care system there is much more to be done and that has been true for too long because of this the nations focus on the critical objective of health care modernization is rapidly escalating unitedhealth group has been a strong advocate of health care coverage for all americans for many years our enterprise has been deeply involved in the work of improving the health care system better health care is both our business and our social mission the theme of this  annual report is delivering value in health care in ways that meet the varying expectations of unitedhealth groups many stakeholders  the same stakeholders of the american health care system itself this report provides a window into some of the work and creativity we combine to advance the interests of our stakeholders as we strive to make the health care system work better for everyone unitedhealth group builds value through greater affordability and quality expanding access to care and through innovation such as in the market transition to consumerism caring for aging and chronic disease populations and using information and technology to modernize health care services and improve benefi t designs we deliver value by controlling health care costs by introducing new more effi cient technology and by helping to simplify an increasingly complex health care world we create this value through our people  more than  talented individuals who are passionate about our mission to help people live healthier lives our enterprise is organized to address the highly complex health care system itself through a business model that is intentionally broad diverse and adaptable enabling us to leverage strengths and balance challenges in a wide range of circumstances our model allows us to endure stress and change as the health care system evolves we can adapt to participate in new opportunities our health benefi ts businesses consist of unitedhealthcare ovations and americhoice

areas in which we have cultivated marketleading capabilities  our ability to effectively and effi ciently organize and manage complex health delivery systems and integrate expert care management capabilities to source the right care to each individual patient from the right care provider and location to drive the best possible outcome from a quality and cost perspective  our vast technological infrastructure which provides the ability to conduct and integrate literally billions of data elements and millions of transactions of enormous variety and complexity on a routine daily basis at very low cost and  our capability to analyze model and act on information  to use it strategically to advance health care performance on many levels we have focused on these three foundational assets for more than three decades and they have served the health care system and our own enterprise well throughout our corporate history we have been at the forefront of virtually every innovation in the health care system and a leader in helping implement government reform of health carein  unitedhealth group did not achieve the consistency of operating and performance results that has been our aspiration and our hallmark for example we did not produce yearoveryear growth in net earnings per share for the fi rst time in many years our response has been swift and decisive and the work has enhanced our position for   we have reduced operating costs by better sharing common resources across the enterprise  we have achieved more effective and consistent clinical performance and medical cost management which are critical to affordable quality health care we are containing medical costs through the introduction of new tools that leverage our vast information databases and better address variations in the delivery of care while strengthening the consistent application of evidencebased medicine and expert physician guidance to care management  we have further advanced our commitment to a culture of service that is deep and broad and which strengthens our relationships with everyone we touch in the health care continuum we are building their trust in us  trust that we will do the right thing and do it effi ciently thoughtfully consistently and in a timely manner and  we have accelerated the already strong pace of innovation across our businesses better focusing our resources to provide personalized health care benefi ts and services at lower costs the results of our efforts have strengthened our market position and fi nancial performance while we are cautious in our outlook given the general economic uncertainties we are optimistic about our performance in  we are hopeful that efforts to modernize the health care system in america will be moving forward at an accelerated pace in the next few years we support the principle of universal coverage for all americans yet we understand that simply changing the coverage protocols or the funding pools wont resolve the core issues if we are to improve and modernize the system in essential and sustainable ways we have to think broadly and focus on the root causes of uncontrolled health care costs and the other basic challenges the system faces as a nation we will have to address rapidly escalating health care costs an unacceptable level of uninsured citizens uneven quality and ineffi cient uses of care care for those with chronic diseases and the wide variations in the effectiveness of care we must align payment systems modernize and standardize health technology strengthen primary care to improve medical outcomes introduce meaningful litigation reform and work with communities and individuals to change unhealthy lifestyles and behaviors to prevent disease and promote health our  letter to shareholders called for fundamental reform of the health care system and universal access elements of that letter remain highly relevant today  we must promote a process that clearly defi nes what constitutes a basic health benefi t package and then work to deliver these basic benefi ts to everyone  the administrative components of health care services need acrosstheboard simplifi cation and standardization  evidencebased medicine should be upheld as the standard of quality  health consumers must receive better information and decisionsupport tools as they participate along with their physicians in making health care decisions we sent that letter to every member of congress we did that because a more modern and effective approach to health care is important for our nation good for american business and good for the consumers of health care as well reform and broad changes in health care have taken place in the past at both the federal and state levels and we have helped drive and enable many of those reforms history confi rms that changes of this nature have almost always resulted in expanded opportunities for those who anticipate and embrace change unitedhealth group was built on this premise and has fl ourished on health care reform and our innovative response to changeso when you think of unitedhealth

142,United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2009,in  the people of unitedhealth group delivered a strong performance while advancing our mission to help people live healthier lives despite a very difficult economy we demonstrated consistency in effectively managing medical costs and continued to reduce our own operating costs our businesses again steadily delivered in service and practical innovation we continued to combine national scale with local responsiveness and further diversified our products services and markets we built stronger relationships with the people we serve across the health care community our balance sheet grew stronger  our investments performed well and our leverage decreasedas a result we entered  a much stronger enterprise we are positioned for the next generation of growth in both health benefits and health services while we cannot predict what changes ultimately will be introduced to the health care system we understand that in any setting we must combine consistent fundamental execution with our proven ability to adapt to core market demands and continuously innovate in practical ways across the health care experience the extraordinary national debate over the future of health care in the united states serves to shine a spotlight on a key challenge how do we modernize the health care system in a fiscally responsible manner to make quality health care accessible and affordable for all americans finding innovative practical and financially responsible answers to that question has been our objective for more than two decades this annual report highlights just a handful of the many ways we are helping create a more modern and effective health care system we continue to make it easier for people to get the care they need to personalize and simplify their health care experience to strengthen the bonds between patients and their physicians to foster the introduction of modern technology and to find new ways to control the rising costs of health care these advances are critically important as we move into the next decade we believe positive competitive pressures and evergrowing demands from individuals and employers physicians and medical facilities and state and federal governments will open the health care system to even greater change  change that will accelerate the evolution of new products and services and costeffective new technologies spurring even more rapid modernization of our health care system the changes we envision include  common administrative standards and enabling technology will connect and unify patients health care providers health benefit plans and the entire health care sector actionable information will be available electronically to help physicians and patients make better decisions together  evidencebased medicine will become widely accepted and consistently practiced improving care quality and helping to control costs  transparency performance accountability and comparative effectiveness will be adopted across all care services just as they are in other sectors of the economy  americans will become better informed consumers of health services because there will be personalized motivations to be engaged including financial incentives  better management of care driven by education adherence to evidencebased medicine and aligned incentives for patients and health care providers along with supporting information and technologies will become ubiquitous to health care built right into the core of how medicine is practiced rather than existing as a parallel administrative function as it is today  health care will adopt a culture of prevention that promotes good health rather than simply treating illnesses as they are presented in the doctors office or the emergency room there will be a new focus on the challenges of helping people cope with chronic disease as well as the importance of health and wellness programs that can prevent the onset of those conditions for many years or a lifetime  health care will be purchased based on the effectiveness of achieving health outcomes not the volume of services rendered  all health care transactions will follow the lead of the financial industry and become totally electronic  public health plans like medicare and medicaid will be modernized to become more economically viable for the long term and enable better care the modernization of medicare is perhaps the greatest area of opportunity to positively influence health care nationally as well as to improve our financial outlook as a nation these changes to our health care system will promote a positive health agenda for our nation and a positive growth agenda for a company with the range of capabilities market positions capital strength and experience of unitedhealth group our business model and philosophy are designed to align with and help enable this national path into a better health care future we are already delivering many of

to take root and function more effectively for all participantsand as we help lead and adapt to change we are meaningfully deepening our culture as a company to better serve the vital social needs of health care this is apparent in externally measured satisfaction levels among key stakeholders and in the trust we continue to build with those we touch in the health care community engagement among

sales results improved steadily throughout the year finishing with a recordbreaking holiday season samestore sales grew by  percent while diluted earnings per share rose a healthy  percent to  much of

difference our pharmacy business which accounts for roughly  percent of overall sales turned in a tremendous year pharmacy samestore sales jumped  percent with cvs filling more than one in every  us retail drug prescriptions frontend samestore sales increased  percent we also saw improvements in gross margins due largely to increased generic drug sales a significant reduction in inventory losses

photo printing customers have noted their approval of our easytouse kiosks by printing more than  million images through yearend this has reversed the downward trend in the overall photo category caused by the drop in traditional overnight processing our cvs easy mission even drives the way we design our stores with a focus on enabling customers to get what they want as conveniently as

more than  in  more than  percent of our stores were freestanding at the end of  and we expect that figure to reach  percent over the long term on the pages that follow this letter i invite you to witness cvs easy in actionweve distinguished ourselves in other ways as well for example cvs offers a unique frontend focus on cosmetics health and beauty we carry frances avne and vichy beauty care lines and are currently the exclusive us distributor of finlands lumene brand its worth noting that  percent of our lumene customers are new to the skin care category at cvs a clear indicator that

neighborhoods our web site cvscom offers the ability to order unique products online with our pharmacare subsidiary which celebrates its th anniversary in  weve built one of the most comprehensive us pharmacy benefit management pbm and specialty pharmacy companies the fourthlargest pbm overall with  million members pharmacare is recognized as the leader in offering a fullservice solution for small

following the integration of procare our specialty pharmacy division cvs also tries to make it easy for doctors to maximize their time spent with patients we are a charter member of surescripts an organization formed to provide an electronic link between doctors and pharmacies this should help make the prescriptionfilling process faster and more efficient and a highly promising beta test is currently underway in rhode island we expect the necessary connections to be deployed nationwide by yearend  with acceptance by prescribers occurring over timewe are committed to steady longterm profitable growth as we enter  i have reason to feel very optimistic about cvs prospects for starters weve built a topnotch management team that is focused on transforming a good retailer into a great one our team includes a number of individuals who have spent closeto two decades with cvs as well as professionals who have joined us from other industries the resulting breadth of our executive talent has made us a stronger organization ready to seize new opportunities moreover we have clarity of mission among the  associates who are putting our cvs easy initiatives into action every day and helping us unlock our enormous potential its worth noting that length of service averages  years for our plus store managers and nine years for our more than  pharmacists extensive experience and our emerging leaders development program help prepare our top talent for broader field management roleswe fully expect sales to pass  billion in  some  new or relocated stores are slated toopen during the year and total square footage should grow by approximately  percent again nearly all of the net store growth will come from increased penetration in our newer markets after only three years these newer markets will contribute more than  billion in revenue in  we also plan to enter other highgrowth areas such as minneapolis los angeles and orange county california the retail pharmacy industry is expected to more than double to about  billion in annual sales by  our pharmacies stand to benefit from a strong drug discovery pipeline as well as the fdas accelerated approval of generic drugs some  billion in pharmaceuticals will be coming off patent over the next four years demographics also continue to work in our favor the population is aging and prescription drug therapy remains a costeffective approach to meeting health care needs people aged  and over use almost four times as many prescriptions as other individuals according to government estimates this portion of the population will spend  trillion on prescriptions over the next decade the competitive threat of mail order pharmacy has been a much debated issue with consumer resistance growing against benefit plans that force patients to order maintenance medications through the mail we are encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive response to benefit plans that allow customers to fill their day prescriptions in retail stores let me stress that cvs does not oppose dispensing medication through mail order however we are opposed to a small number of pbms implementing plan designs that not only force patients to use mail but also dictate that patients use their captive mail order services at best this practice is harmful to patients because it eliminates choice and deprives them of the opportunity to obtain personal counseling from a community pharmacist at worst it is unfair and anticompetitivein november we watched congress pass a longawaited prescription drug law that goes into effect in  many of its details have yet to be worked out and we will monitor them closely however we believe that this kind of legislation will ultimately be good for senior citizens good for this countrys uninsured and good for cvs ims health predicts that a medicare prescription benefit would add  million incremental prescriptions to the market annuallyanother piece of federal legislation the sarbanesoxley act has garnered a great deal of attention of late enacted to improve corporate governance standards you may be wondering what impact it will have oncvs thanks to a strong corporate governance tradition built over our  years in business cvs has had to make very few changes in fact we are largely formalizing and documenting already existing practices as for our board of directors it has always included talented leaders from corporate america academia and the nonprofit world among them i want to extend a special thanks to ivan seidenberg and eugene applebaum both men served faithfully for many years and retired following our last annual meeting in closing i want to thank longstanding shareholders for the continued confidence you place in our efforts if youre new to cvs then youve become a shareholder during a most exciting period we are a company with a long history to be sure but cvs easy and the other initiatives ive described above demonstrate that we are not encumbered by old ways

under  leveraging our cvs easy efforts as with any cvs location the success of the converted eckerd stores will be driven in part by our ability to make the customer shopping experience cvs easy

easy in action and we continue to look for ways to further improve our customer experience robust pipeline and new generics to help drive future growth we are seeing a temporary slowdown in industry prescription growth which is due to a number of factors they include the slow pace of new drug approvals higher copays and growing coinsurance arrangements rx to overthecounter switches and the growth in mandatory mail order plans however ours is still a growth industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies are hard at work discovering new drugs and  billion worth of branded drug sales will come off

march  weve made these stores cvs easy by reducing shelf heights resetting merchandise layouts installing our hallmark cvs carpet enhancing the lighting and improving the signagesales trends have moved in line with expectations we expect the numbers to climb with the introduction of the cvs brand to these markets and the disruption of the store conversions behind us as noted at the time of purchase the savon and osco stores were operationally in better shape than the eckerd stores we acquired from jc penney in  still we are executing against a significant opportunity to produce higherquality sales through improvements in merchandise assortment and category focus we will also leverage the cvs extracare card to encourage customer loyalty and increase sales and margins looking at the former eckerd stores acquired in  same store sales increased  percent in  the front end rose  percent with the pharmacy up  percent this impressive performance comes on top of the strong gains we posted in  although same store sales growth for these stores will moderate going forward they are still expected to outpace our overall results for the foreseeable future even as cvs completed two major acquisitions in as many years organic square footage increased by  percent in  we opened  stores including  new locations and  relocations factoring in closings we experienced net unit growth of  stores we continued to expand in our newer highgrowth markets including those in florida and texas as well as las vegas los angeles chicago minneapolis and phoenix all our new stores in these markets

prescriptions the medicare part d prescription drug benefit and generic drug launches are among the positive industry factors contributing to our growth medicare part d rolled out in january  has led to increased utilization of prescription drugs since enrolled seniors make the same copayment regardless of the pharmacy they choose many are opting for the convenience of the cvspharmacy located right in their neighborhoods despite a competitors rollout of a  program for selected generic drugs we actually experienced a rise in net prescription transfers in from leading mass merchant retailers and continued to gain pharmacy share use of generic drugs continues to climb and they now account for more than  percent of prescriptions filled although their lower prices depress revenue growth

ailments right in our stores the high level of patient satisfaction received to date has solidified our belief that this is the right concept for consumers payors and providers we made the decision to buy minuteclinic already a strategic partner because we wanted control of its brand as well as personnel decisions hours of operation and expansion rate most importantly we saw an opportunity to benefit from additional revenues and profits since the acquisition we have almost doubled the number of minuteclinics from  to  across  states furthermore we plan to open approximately  minuteclinics in  with well over  cvspharmacy stores slated to have minuteclinics over the long term creating a company that serves payors and consumers more efficiently as this report goes to press we are also

many of the changes that will reshape our industry in the coming years shareholders of both companies have yet to vote on the merger but we are optimistic about the outcome regardless cvspharmacy and pharmacare have proven how powerful a combined retailpbm model can be we will aggressively leverage these twin strengths in the future because they will allow us to pursue new opportunities and help improve the delivery of healthcare in the united states consumers want convenience choice and to get more for their healthcare dollar employers and health plans want to give plan members access to a full range of integrated pharmacy services promote better health outcomes and control costs at the same time managing the significant costs of specialty pharmacy care remains a critical area of concern for employers and other plan sponsors we are wellpositioned to address this issue through endtoend participation  from plan design to delivery of valueadded pharmacy services via facetoface interaction with customers we can accomplish this on a broader platform through our proposed merger with caremark or through accelerated organic growth of our retailpbm model we will carefully evaluate all our opportunities to ensure that we help drive the changes necessary to improve our industrysupporting our next phase of growth with key promotions with the retail and healthcare

154,CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2007,the past year set the stage for a new chapter in our companys history as we completed the transformational merger of cvs corporation and caremark rx inc we are now the largest integrated provider of prescriptions and related health services in the united states filling or managing more than a quarter of all prescriptions in the nation beyond the sheer scale of our operations cvs caremark is positioned to improve access for patients promote better health outcomes and control payor costs in a way that no pharmacy retailer or pbm could do separately our unique model provides us with a significant opportunity to gain share and create new sources of growth going forward it was a very successful year on a number of other fronts as well here are some highlights of our key accomplishments  cvs caremark posted record revenue and earnings driven by solid performance in both the retail and pharmacy services segments  we opened  new or relocated cvspharmacy stores and saw continued improvement in sales and profits in the stores we acquired from albertsons inc in  and from jc penney in   caremark pharmacy services signed up  billion in new business a clear sign that payors understand the potential benefits of our combination  we opened  minuteclinics increasing our total at yearend to  clinics in  states thats about four times the number operated by our nearest competitor  we attained our goal of generating  billion in free cash flow and we launched a  billion share repurchase program that we completed in the first quarter of   even in the midst of all this activity we remained keenly focused on service execution and expense control across the company total revenues rose  percent to a record  billion in our cvspharmacy segment same store sales rose  percent gross margins increased in both our retail and pbm businesses due largely to significant generic drug introductions and purchasing synergies resulting from the merger net earnings climbed  percent to  billion or  per diluted share turning to cvs caremarks stock performance the  percent total return on our shares far surpassed the modest numbers posted by the sp  index and the dow jones industrial average djia in  our threeyear performance is just as impressive while the sp  and the djia returned  percent and  percent respectively cvs shares returned  percent were going to offer services that no other competitor can match in the short time since completing our merger weve made substantial progress in integrating our two companies we brought pharmacare cvs legacy pbm business under the caremark umbrella connected all our backend systems and are set to achieve more than  million in costsaving synergies in  thats over  percent higher than our original target at the time we first announced the merger weve also made important progress in developing differentiated offerings that we believe will lead to enhanced growth for our company over time obviously were offering payors and patients all the services they would expect from a worldclass pbm however we plan to take those services a step further for example lets take the area of compliance one of the simplest ways for a pbm to control payor costs and improve outcomes is by encouraging patients to take the medicine prescribed to them and to renew their prescriptions promptly any pbm has the capability to do this by contacting these patients over the telephone or by mail however facetoface interaction is far more effective and our cvspharmacy stores give us the unique capability to get closer to the consumer were developing programs that tap into the combined  pharmacists and minuteclinic practitioners in our locations across the country we also intend to build upon our no  position in the highgrowth specialty pharmacy market leverage our extracare card and all its unique benefits among our millions of covered lives enhance our health management programs and increase use of minuteclinic by our pbm clients well implement some of our initiatives relatively quickly others will happen over time were leveraging opportunities for greater profitability in the pharmacy in both our retail and mail order pharmacies we are benefiting from the aging population greater utilization among seniors due to medicare part d and the increasing use of generic drugs although their lower prices depress revenue growth and we continue to see pressure on pharmacy reimbursement rates generics are more profitable than brand name drugs and help drive margin expansion moreover cvs caremark is now the largest purchaser of generic drugs in the united states which enables us to drive down costs in  the company had a  percent generic dispensing rate at retail with approximately  billion in branded drug sales coming off patent in the next five years we expect that figure to rise to  percent by  we should see similar gains for caremarks pbm business whose generic dispensing rate is currently at  percent generic versions of bioengineered drugs represent another opportunity currently the united states has no procedure for approving generic versions of bioengineered drugs when they come off patent however we expect to see congress enact legislation at some point in the future to create a biogeneric approval process at the us food and drug administration we will be well positioned if or when this occurs we continue to open new stores and make the most of recent acquisitions despite the past years merger activity we continued to execute our organic growth strategy at retail cvspharmacy square footage grew by  percent in line with our annual target of the  stores we opened  were new locations and  were relocations factoring in closings we enjoyed net unit growth of  stores we continued to expand in our newer highgrowth areas such as los angeles san diego phoenix las vegas and minneapolis the former eckerd locations that we acquired in  still enjoyed same store sales growth that outpaced our overall numbers these stores are benefiting from their locations in highgrowth markets  mainly florida and texas  and they continue to gain share from competitors as well were also very pleased with the performance of the standalone savon and osco stores we purchased from albertsons this acquisition strengthened our presence in the midwest and provided us with an immediate leadership position in southern california the countrys secondlargest drugstore market in fact our southern california cvs pharmacy stores now lead the entire chain in sales these new cvspharmacy stores are benefiting from an improved merchandise assortment and category focus the introduction of the extracare card is encouraging customer loyalty and helping drive an increase in sales and margins in the front of the store were seeing sales growth across our core categories especially in beauty personal care general merchandise and digital photo cvs store brands and proprietary brands have been important drivers of gross margins as solid as our frontend business is its worth noting that it accounts for  percent of our retail sales compared with  percent for the pharmacy the frontend percentage becomes even smaller in the context of cvs caremarks overall revenues thats why we expect any impact on cvspharmacy from a softer economy to be limited and manageable after all our average frontend purchase is a little under  and we dont anticipate that consumers will buy less cough medicine analgesics or any of the other nondiscretionaryitems that make up the majority of our frontend sales we even stand to benefit if consumers turn to our highquality lowercost cvs store brand products to save money were expanding minuteclinic as part of our broader health care offerings for many cvspharmacy customers  presented them with their first chance to visit one of our instore minuteclinics focused on treating a limited number of common ailments at a competitive price it is helping us lower costs for health plans and selfinsured employers minuteclinic has seen more than  million patients since inception and customer response has been extremely positive it is the only retail clinic to meet the rigorous guidelines of the joint commission the nations chief standardssetting and accrediting body in health care at least  percent of minuteclinic patients have not previously been cvspharmacy customers that represents a significant opportunity to introduce them to the cvs easy shopping experience and reap incremental sales gains in the pharmacy and the front end as i mentioned earlier were also working to incorporate minuteclinic into our pbm offerings when caremark sits down at the table with current and potential clients before closing i want to take this opportunity to thank the outstanding management team we have across our retail and pbm businesses and the more than  people in our company who helped make the past years accomplishments possible ive often said we have the best people in the industry and they proved me right again i deeply appreciate their dedication i also want to acknowledge the considerable contributions mac crawford made at the helm of caremark for nine years and in his subsequent role as the first chairman of the board of our combined company mac chose to step down in november and i wish him a happy and healthy retirement we shared the same vision for the future of this industry and the core team he assembled remains the guiding force at caremark pharmacy services former director roger headrick provided invaluable guidance during his  years on the caremark board and i want to thank him for his contributions as well we really are at a pivotal moment in our history with cvs caremark poised to transform the delivery of pharmacy services in this country weve done so much more than just combine two very successful businesses weve literally created a firstofitskind company  one with the ability to grow faster than either of its components would have on its own for us thats the real power of one thank you for your confidence,2.637,1.0

shockwaves across so much of the business landscape in  cvs caremark has a solid balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating and we maintain a commercial paper program currently backed by  billion in committed bank facilities as noted the us economy is defi  nitely in a recession and it will likely last throughout  well feel its effect to some degree with growth in script utilization slowing industrywide lower utilization layoffs and job loss will affect our pbm business however in a landscape where control of health care spending is urgently needed our proven costreducing services and the costeffective care offered through minuteclinic should prove more valuable than ever our share price certainly wasnt immune to the turmoil in the fi nancial markets during the past year but we still outperformed the broad market averages our shares fell  percent in  compared with the  percent decline of the sp  index and the  percent drop in the dow jones industrial average djia

smallcap companies to government entities and private insurers were achieving this by offering payors and patients everything they have come to expect from a toprated pbm however were also offering plan design options and services that no standalone pbm can match through the proactive pharmacy care offerings we began rolling out in  were giving consumers easier access to their medications and to the counseling they need whether it is through one of our mail pharmacies or at one of our more than  stores by helping patients adhere to their drug therapies were lowering overall health care costs and improving outcomes you can read about specifi c proactive pharmacy care offerings such as maintenance choice and integrated specialty elsewhere in this report let me note though how pleased we are that over  clients have already committed to offering maintenance choice to their more than  million covered lives specialty pharmacy and our medicare part d prescription drug plan pdp business are also part of our pbm segment the past year marked our th anniversary in specialty pharmacy our industrys fastestgrowing sector in fact specialty pharmacy accounts for approximately  percent of the money spent on prescription drugs in the united states even though these medications are used by only a small fraction of the population payors need help managing these costs and cvs caremark is the clear category leader based on prescriptions we fi ll or manage we have a  percent share of the  billion specialty market addressable by pbms and drug retailers still we currently provide specialty services to only  percent of our pbm customers the ability to cross sell to the remaining  percent represents an important opportunity for growth medicare part d continues to play a key role in ensuring that seniors can afford the prescriptions they need were a major factor in this arena through our silverscript and rxamerica proprietary pdp plan offerings and as a provider of pbm services to these plans and to pdps sponsored by others through our pdps and related pbm activities we expect to cover approximately  million lives in were moving quickly to integrate longs drug stores and improve their performance in our retail business im delighted to welcome over  longs colleagues to our company the longs acquisition has given us a highquality network of more than  drugstores  primarily in central and northern california and hawaii  as well as longs rxamerica pbm commercial real estate values in california and hawaii are among the highest in the country and it would have taken at least a decade to assemble the prime locations we acquired had we instead opted exclusively for organic growth in these markets we had only a modest presence in central and northern california and none in hawaii by acquiring longs we have become the leader in both markets virtually overnight in fact we now have over  stores in california more than any other drugstore chain weve also begun to integrate rxamerica  and its  million plan participants  with our pbm business more importantly our greater presence on the west coast and in hawaii plays an important strategic role for our pbm as it pursues new contracts we can extend our proactive pharmacy care offerings to plan sponsors with active or retired employees living in these markets ive often said that we dont acquire stores for growth rather we acquire stores that we can grow the longs deal is no exception our existing stores outperform the longs locations signifi cantly in sales per square foot gross margins and other important measures we intend to leverage our systems our focus on private label and exclusive brands our category mix and the extracare loyalty card to turn good stores into great ones we recognize that the recession is impacting the california economy and it may take us a while to accomplish this when the economy rebounds though we will have outstanding wellrun assets in place weve had a lot of experience in making the most of the opportunities inherent in our acquisitions just take a look at the stores we acquired from jcpenney in  and from albertsons in  weve been able to increase their sales per square foot considerably and have realized healthy margin gains as well moreover we still see signifi cant opportunities to improve the profi tability of both acquisitions we led the industry in samestore sales growth in both the pharmacy and front of the store even as we completed the longs acquisition we continued to execute our organic growth strategy at retail retail square footage increased by  percent in line with our annual target we opened a total of  new or relocated stores factoring in closings organic net unit growth increased by  stores our cvspharmacyretail business had an outstanding year with samestore sales rising an industryleading  percent pharmacy samestore sales increased by  percent even with the adoption of new generics were gratifi ed by early consumer response to the health savings pass for prescription drugs we introduced in november for the uninsured and underinsured given the current state of the economy this is one of the ways in which we can help make health care more affordable for the general public we are also in the process of rolling out our new pharmacy system rxconnect which will reengineer the way pharmacists communicate and fi ll prescriptionssamestore sales in the front of the store increased by  percent and we gained share in  percent of our frontstore categories since nondiscretionary items account for the majority of frontend sales that part of our business should prove relatively recessionresistant and given the state of the economy customers have been more willing to try our privatelabel and proprietary products sales of privatelabel and cvsexclusive brands rose faster than in prior years to more than  percent of our frontend total at yearend much like generics in the pharmacy these offerings also yield greater margins minuteclinics expanded offerings bolster our health care strategy as part of our broader health care strategy weve continued to open minuteclinic locations and expand their range of services they now include wellness and prevention screenings and a larger selection of vaccinations we also launched pilot programs to incorporate minuteclinic into our pbm offerings for example some of our pbm plan participants can now stop in for health assessments at convenient locations weve noted since minuteclinics acquisition that its competitive price can help us lower costs for health plans and selfinsured employers they have begun to embrace this model and weve been able to contract with more payors as a result in fact visits paid for by third parties amounted to more than  percent of our total in  our expanded health care focus can also be seen in the appointment of troyen brennan md in november  to the newly created role of chief medical offi cer dr brennan a practicing physician former hospital administrator and most recently chief medical offi cer at aetna has assumed responsibility for minuteclinic accordant health care clinical and medical affairs and our health care strategy broad industry trends will contribute to our longterm performance with strong execution across our businesses we have good reason to feel optimistic about the future we expect a number of longterm industry trends to work in our favor as well including rising use of generic drugs and the aging of the us population well over  percent of all drugs dispensed in  across our industry were generics that fi gure is likely to rise to  percent by  as several blockbuster drugs lose patent protection looking at the us population approximately  million people are  or older today that number is projected to climb to  million by  and prescription drug use is expected to rise substantially within this demographic with leading market positions in california florida and other sunbelt states we stand to benefi t from this trend to a greater extent than most other pharmacy players other changes are likely to unfold in the coming years that should benefi t cvs caremark patients and payors alike among them the obama administration has already begun exploring ways in which health insurance can be broadened to cover a larger portion of the population the resulting increase in access to prescription drugs would be good for cvs caremark and good for the country legislation paving the way for a biogeneric approval process as well as growth in eprescribing is also on the horizon we look forward to working with the new administration on health care reform on behalf of the board of directors and cvs caremarks  colleagues across the country thank you for your confi dence in our company and our vision we are just beginning to realize the benefi ts of our broader pharmacy health care mission,3.212,1.0
156,CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2009,health care delivery in the united states is slowly evolving to a new model and we believe that companies best positioned to promote better outcomes and lower costs will be among the winners that thinking guided the  merger of cvs and caremark today were the largest pharmacy health care company in the united states and our strengths across the spectrum of pharmacy care are helping us deliver savings and improve the plan member experience for pbm clients ill have more to say about the success of our differentiated approach as well as the core strengths of our pbm and retail businesses first let me provide a quick review of our solid financial performance in  in the midst of a challenging economic environment cvs caremark reported record revenue and earnings total revenue rose  percent to  billion with income from continuing operations up  percent to  billion we generated approximately  billion in free cash flow deploying part of it to complete a  billion share repurchase program furthermore the board of directors authorized an additional  billion share repurchase program which we began in  and intend to complete in the first half of  our strong free cash flow also allowed us to raise the dividend by  percent for  this marks our seventh consecutive annual dividend increase over this period our dividend has risen at an  percent compound annual growth rate cvs caremark shares produced a total return of  percent for  although we trailed the broad market averages due largely to some concerns over our pbms nearterm growth outlook however over the past five years cvs caremark delivered a total return to shareholders of  percent while the sp  and the dow jones industrial average returned  percent and  percent respectively over the same period our integrated model builds on existing pbm strengths building on caremarks longstanding reputation for customer service clinical excellence and an ability to control payor costs our integrated approach to pharmacy care is yielding substantial benefits our more than  pharmacists nurse practitioners and physician assistants drive our efforts every day based on internal surveys colleague engagement stands at an alltime high their commitment is clearly reflected in our outstanding performance across a number of measures im pleased to report that we have done an outstanding job of controlling costs for our pbm clients weve done this by driving generic utilization through unique plan designs by controlling specialty pharmacy trend through our specialty guideline management programs and by improving adherence to prescribed medications through our multiple points of contact with plan members for many people a facetoface interaction with their pharmacist results in a significantly higher adherence rate we have a broad research effort underway to learn more about why patients do not take prescriptions that are prescribed or drop medications in the middle of therapy the research includes continuing internal analysis of cvs caremark client utilization and an external partnership with harvard and brigham and womens hospital separately a recent study by the new england healthcare institute found that not taking medications as prescribed leads to poorer health more frequent hospitalization a higher risk of death and as much as  billion annually in increased medical costs across the us health care system as the health care debate continues one thing is clear we all have to find ways to make health care more affordable cvs caremark is focusing on adherence to impact the health of our customers and help take costs out of the health care system in  we expect adherence rates to be further enhanced when our consumer engagement engine cee goes live across our major channels during the second half of the year powered by clinical rules the cee will identify opportunities to promote better health outcomes and to achieve costs savings across our unparalleled points of contact the marketplace has enthusiastically embraced our innovative maintenance choice offering which gives eligible plan members access to day mail pricing whether they receive their prescriptions through the mail or choose to pick them up at one of our approximately  conveniently located retail locations this offering eliminates the plan member disruption that many payors face when they consider mandatory mail programs for cost savings furthermore clients that switched from a voluntary mail program to maintenance choice saw their generic dispensing rates gdr improve and achieved savings of up to  percent of their pharmacy costs we currently serve  pbm clients and more than  have signed up for maintenance choice to date that leaves significant upside as more existing and prospective clients begin to appreciate its benefits we anticipate higher retention levels and more new business opportunities for  obviously weve faced some headwinds as well in our pbm business we won  billion dollars in new pbm revenues over the past two years but we also lost a similar amount of existing business over this same timeframe as a result of some unique circumstances affecting a handful of accounts client renewals for  are looking strong though and im confident that retention will return to caremarks historically high levels on the new business front we took steps to reposition our sales message to focus first on our industryleading pbm capabilities were talking to clients about how we are able to lower their costs and improve the plan member experience that is resonating well during the  selling season and there are a significant number of large prospects out to bid with howard mclures retirement im delighted that we were able to hire per lofberg as our new pbm president per who joined us in january  brings more than  years of experience in the health care and pbm industries formerly chairman of merckmedco managed care llc which later became medco health solutions hemost recently served as president and ceo of our strategic partner generation health inc per is widely respected in the industry and his expertise along with his demonstrated ability to execute growth strategies makes him the perfect person to guide our pbm in this evolving health care environment our samestore sales growth leads all pharmacy retailers despite the recession our retail stores put up outstanding numbers samestore sales rose  percent while pharmacy samestore sales increased  percent these results led our industry throughout  and we gained significant market share organic growth continued apace as we opened  new or relocated stores factoring in closings net unit growth was  stores today approximately  percent of the us population lives within three miles of a cvs store our stores fill nearly one in five prescriptions nationwide and we have the # or # market share in  of the top  us drugstore markets our industryleading customer service and the use of advanced technology combined with the increasing adoption of maintenance choice by pbm clients all contributed to our pharmacy growth in the front of the store we gained share in  percent of our core categories moreover sales of privatelabel and cvsexclusive brands rose faster than they have historically to account for nearly  percent of our frontend total these lowercost products offer excellent value which clearly appealed to costconscious consumers in the midst of a recession we in turn benefited from the higher margins these products provide compared with national brands our privatelabel program is ambitious and we added more than  offerings to our shelves during the year the longs drugs stores we acquired in october  were integrated on schedule and are on track to be accretive to earnings in  profitability is already on the rise as weve begun to leverage our systems our focus on private label our category mix and the extracare card we have a solid track record at making the most of our acquisitions roughly doubling the profitability of the drugstores we acquired from jcpenney in  and from albertsons in  extracare and other longterm investments have helped drive profitability we can trace our industryleading performance in no small part to the many investments we have made over the past decade in technology in enhancing the layout and shopability of our stores and in driving customer loyalty the extracare loyalty program which we rolled out in  is today the most popular among all retailers more than  million active cardholders take advantage of sales in the store and at cvscom and they received  billion in extracare savings and extra bucks rewards throughout  extracare represents a significant competitive advantage for us and cvs caremark has a huge head start over any drug retailer contemplating its own loyalty program more recent investments position cvs caremark for greater profitability in the coming years for example our proprietary rxconnect computer system whose rollout will be completed during  should improve both efficiency and customer service in our pharmacies weve also opened call centers that allow us to redirect much of the telephone call volume from our busiest stores that frees up retail pharmacists to spend more time counseling patients facetoface weve expanded minuteclinics offerings and forged new alliances at minuteclinic our retailbased health clinics we expanded the services offered further integrated minuteclinic into our pbm offerings and forged a number of strategic alliances with highly regarded health care providers such as humana inc and the cleveland clinic today we have approximately  clinics in  markets across the countryin  a key focus will be adding protocoldriven monitoring services for common chronic illnesses such as diabetes hypertension and high cholesterol that will be done in coordination with a patients treating physician and is designed to improve adherence and outcomes we also expect to offer additional acute care services and improved point of service lab tests under its new president andrew sussman md this business is moving in the right direction cvs caremark will continue to benefit from new products and broad industry trends looking ahead we will continue to offer new and innovative services that help attract and retain pbm and retail customers for example we plan to expand pharmacogenomic clinical and testing services for cvs caremark pbm clients through our ownership stake in generation health we want to improve care for patients who are either nonresponsive to their medications or who experience adverse reactions as a result of their genomic makeup we expect to begin offering these services during  we are currently in the process of transitioning our iscribe clients to allscripts the largest provider of eprescribing and electronic health record solutions eprescribing can significantly reduce medication errors with this partnership we hope to accelerate the adoption of eperscribing across our client base broad industry trends will work in our favor as well from potential health care reform and an aging population to new blockbuster and generic drug introductions cvs caremark has been participating in the national debate over legislation to reform the us health care system we believe the right combination of reform and expansion will be good for the nation as the largest provider of costeffective pharmacy care in this country we stand ready to support this effort looking at demographics the number of people in the united states who are  or older will jump to roughly  million by  and to  million by  this age group fills an average of more than  prescriptions per person annually   percent more than people between the ages of  and  that will increase utilization dramatically for years to come and will help drive the growth of both our pbm and retail businesses of course the opportunity in generics is enormous nearly  billion in branded drug sales will lose patent protection over the next six years as a result our gdr could eventually approach  percent that is expected to further reduce costs for health plans plan sponsors and their members while expanding our pharmacy margins we are also hopeful that congress will pass legislation that finally paves the way for a biogeneric approval process as you can see were very optimistic about our prospects both in the shortterm and longterm pharmacy health care in this country has a bright future and we believe our combined assets will lead to a bright future for our company for years to come on behalf of our board of directors and our  colleagues across the country thank you for investing in cvs caremark,3.696,1.0
157,CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2010,us health care costs are expected to rise  percent annually over the next decade pushing the total spent in the united states to around  trillion in  the alarming growth of chronic disease in an aging us population will drive much of this increase and companies that can find a way to help employers insurers and plan members rein in the related costs are poised to benefitat cvs caremark we see a significant opportunity to reduce the nearly  billion that is spent annually as a result of nonadherence to prescribed medications and other forms of suboptimal pharmacy care as the nations largest pharmacy health care provider we can accomplish this through our differentiated pbm offerings our leadership in clinical programs and specialty pharmacy our unmatched retail footprint and our growing base of minuteclinic locations our strategy is to utilize these elements of our integrated pharmacy services model to lower health care costs while improving the health of those we serve its important to remember that pharmacy care remains one of the most costeffective ways of treating disease so we are wellpositioned to slow the rise in health care costs even as we encourage appropriate utilization of prescription drugs well have more to say on this topic and the state of our business in general lets start though with a quick overview of the past years performance our  financial performance and commitment to enhancing shareholder value  marked a year of substantial progress for our company despite continued challenges in the broader economy we successfully navigated through a challenging retail and consumer environment delivering industryleading samestore sales growth solid expense control and significantly improved retail operating margins however we faced some welldocumented challenges in our pbm business and we are disappointed with our performance total revenue decreased  percent to  billion with income from continuing operations down  percent to  billion we will talk more about the steps we are taking to turn around pbm performance cvs caremark shares returned  percent in  trailing the  percent return of the sp  index our belowmarket share performance is unacceptable and enhancing shareholder returns remains a top priority for us accordingly we returned more than  billion to our shareholders last year through a combination of share repurchases and dividends we were able to accomplish this as a result of the  billion in free cash flow we generated in  a  percent increase over  we expect our cashgeneration capabilities to increase substantially in the coming years due to anticipated earnings growth and a sweeping initiative to reduce working capital we will take a disciplined approach to deploying the substantial cash we generate to achieve the highest possible return for our shareholders we will invest in highreturn projects and expect to continue returning value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and valueenhancing share repurchases to that end we recently raised our dividend by  percent making this our eighth consecutive year with a dividend increase we also expect to complete our  billion authorized share repurchase during  longterm agreement with aetna highlights strong  pbm selling season as we said we have begun to take steps to turn around the performance of our pbm after experiencing contract losses in the  pbm selling season we undertook a series of steps to stabilize and grow our pbm and position the business for longterm success we reestablished momentum in the  selling season and are very pleased with our progress to date our client satisfaction rate remained high and we saw a  percent retention rate during the season we also added a significant amount of net new business with revenues totaling approximately  billion the  selling season is off to a good start as well clients are enthusiastic about our differentiated offerings which enjoyed positive momentum in the  selling season maintenance choice which gives plan participants the option of filling their day maintenance prescriptions by mail or at one of our convenient retail locations has been adopted by approximately  clients representing  million lives our generic step therapy programs have been adopted by  clients representing  million lives our newest addition the pharmacy advisortm program has already been adopted by pbm clients representing more than  million lives or approximately  percent of our pbm book of business the year agreement we landed in july to provide aetna with a broad range of pbm services marked a watershed for our company the result of an extensive competitive bidding process it provides significant validation of our core pbm capabilities as well as the benefits we bring to the table through our integrated model once fully implemented cvs caremark will serve approximately  million aetna pbm members and administer approximately  billion in annual drug spending in addition to taking over management of aetnas retail pharmacy network as well as pharmacy customer and member service functions cvs caremark will also handle purchasing inventory management and prescription fulfillment for aetnas mailorder and specialty pharmacy operations we see significant upside opportunity from this relationship over time as we work together to offer our unique products that will help lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes for memberswe are streamlining operations and are strategically positioned in highgrowth businesses while we expect to see a decline in pbm operating profit in  we are optimistic about our pbms longterm prospects and believe we are wellpositioned to navigate the challenges and opportunities facing the industry in the coming years among our priorities we have begun implementing a pbm streamlining initiative to improve our workflow and align our cost structure more closely with peers the pbm much like cvs on the retail side went through significant acquisition activity over the past decade and there are still many opportunities to build a more cohesive efficient and streamlined organization this pbm initiative is expected to deliver more than  billion in savings between  and  we also have all the capabilities in place to increase our revenues and expand our market share for example lets take a look at specialty pharmacy we currently generate more than  billion in specialty pharmacy revenue annually making us the largest specialty pharmacy provider in the us through our industryleading specialty guideline management program we facilitate appropriate utilization across disease states and help clients control their specialty spending specialty is also the fastestgrowing pharmacy sector with a compound annual growth rate of approximately  percent expected over the next five years cvs caremark is also a very significant player in the medicare part d business one of the fastestgrowing areas of the pbm space while our  results reflect the negative impact from a disappointing medicare part d competitive bidding process for the  plan year and regulatory changes that reduced our profitability we view medicare part d as an integral part of our longterm strategy a growing portion of the population will receive its prescription drug coverage under medicare plans driven by age demographics and the anticipated shift of retirees from employerbased coverage to medicare in fact we expect the medicare part d market to grow  percent annually on average from  through  our size and capabilities position us to capitalize on this opportunity and we have a dedicated group with new leadership to focus our efforts in anticipation of this continued growth we recently announced an agreement to acquire universal americans medicare part d business for approximately  billion this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval as well as approval by universal american shareholders upon closing it would more than double the size of our prescription drug plan pdp business to more than three million members and make us a strong # player in medicare part d the deal is expected to close at the end of the second quarter of  we expect to benefit from the addition of universal americans medicare advantage prescription drug plan mapd insurance business beginning in  and to begin servicing the pbm contracts for both the pdp and universal americans mapd business beginning in january  pharmacy advisor utilizes our retail footprint to improve care and control costs we are very excited about the rollout of our pharmacy advisor program early in  it will help us add value for our pbm clients and improve the health of plan members leveraging our retail presenceunique among major pbmswe can offer chronically ill patients the benefit of facetoface counseling in our pharmacies to improve their medication adherence rates and close gaps in care based on our research and the pilot program for diabetes patients that we completed in  instore counseling helps close gaps in care at nearly twice the rate of phone counseling alone using pharmacy advisor a pbm client with  employees whose population has an average prevalence of diabetes could save approximately  million a year in medical expendituresweve spent the past three years developing and implementing the technology that makes pharmacy advisor possible utilizing clinical rules our consumer engagement engine identifies cost savings or health improvement opportunities for pbm plan members whether they interact with us at our retail and specialty pharmacies through our mail order pharmacies or using our web sites weve made diabetes intervention our initial priority in the future pharmacy advisor will also address issues related to coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension hyperlipidemia and other chronic illnesses our minuteclinic offerings and footprint will expand to meet growing demand our  minuteclinic locations represent another important aspect of our unique value proposition nonflu vaccination visits to minuteclinic increased by  percent in  we have really focused our efforts over the past year at bringing new products and services to market that help manage chronic conditions we expect to incorporate these new capabilities into our pbm plan offerings as we move into the care of patients with chronic disease we have also established formal affiliations with some of the countrys leading health systems to collaborate on patient care we expect health care reform to bring some form of coverage to  million people who are currently uninsured minuteclinic will help meet the growing demand for care and mitigate the growing shortage of primary care physicians we will begin adding approximately  new clinics annually over the next five years we will start by filling in existing markets as well as adding new markets in existing states with plans to enter new states beginning in industryleading performance across several measures characterizes the year in retail our retail stores continued to outperform competitors and gain share in  and we expect a similar outcome in  we led the industry with  percent samestore sales growth  percent in the pharmacy and  percent in the front of the store we also outperformed all drugstore chains in sales per square foot and profitability measures we opened  new or relocated stores in  factoring in closings net units increased by  stores which equates to  percent retail square footage growth over the next three years we expect to add approximately  net new stores annually that would increase our retail square footage growth each year by  to  percent cvspharmacy entered nine new markets over the past two years and results have exceeded our expectations in  alone we opened our first stores in memphis omaha st louis and puerto rico as we accomplished with earlier acquisitions we have improved the performance of the longs drugs stores we purchased in  across several key financial metrics by leveraging our systems our focus on store brands our category mix and our extracare loyalty card profitability in the longs stores has improved significantly in addition average store prescription volumes have increased by more than  percent given the much larger retail footprint and sales mix of the acquired stores we do not expect them to match the sales productivity of our core cvspharmacy locations that said we see significant upside and expect to close the gap further over the next several years in the front of the store our ambitious store brand program generated more than  billion in sales in  store brands now account for  percent of our frontend total and we believe that penetration can reach more than  percent in the next two to three years from overthecounter drugs to grocery items we offer more than  store brand items that are less expensive for shoppers and help create loyalty they provide us with higher margins as well their excellent value has certainly appealed to consumers in this challenging economic environment moreover many of our store brand offerings are far more than just me too versions of national brands weve actually introduced products that either have no nationalbrand equivalent or offer innovative packaging that appeals to more than the just the pricesensitive shopper we expect to add around  new store brand offerings in  the extracare loyalty program remains one of the main drivers of our industryleading performance in the front of the store the largest loyalty program among all us retailers it now boasts more than  million active cardholders in  they received  billion in extracare savings and extra bucks rewards our  years of experience working with extracare enables us to fine tune our promotional programs and spend our advertising dollars most efficiently and

have already reconfigured several locations in our urban cluster stores where the front end can exceed  percent of sales we have added assisted selfcheckouts to improve checkout speed and expanded certain categories such as baby and grocery we have converted more than  such stores to date the early results are promising with trips sales and margins all up significantly we are in testing phase with two additional clusters and look forward to sharing more information on our results as we delve further into this opportunity for future growth in closing we operate in a dynamic and growing industry over the past few years we have set up an infrastructure that will position the company to be very productive for years to come we want to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their dedication and hard work we have a sense of urgency an engaged workforce the right assets and the right technology we are extremely wellpositioned to play an important role in the evolving us

the marketplace as we close the chapter on  and look forward to what lies ahead we are optimistic that we can deliver even better results in  the current health care landscape presents a number of challenges that we see as opportunities among them overall health care costs will continue to increase a scenario that will be intensified by an aging population exacerbating this problem is an insufficient focus on lowercost solutions such as preventive care and prescription drug adherence consumers also are taking on greater accountability for their health care as directtoconsumer markets grow and employers shift more and more costs onto their employees moreover the current shortage of primary care doctors combined with a growing demand will result in a major physician shortage our suite of assets is very well aligned to address and bring solutions to these issues weve integrated our industryleading pbm business retail pharmacies and retail health clinics with the following goals in mind  to provide greater access convenience and choice to pharmacy care to deliver solutions that improve the health of those we serve and  to lower the overall cost of health care by capitalizing on cvs caremarks bestinclass businesses as well as the power of our combined entity  what we call our integration sweet spots  we are wellpositioned to deliver on our goal of reinventing pharmacy for better health  and better shareholder value as our strategies have advanced and taken hold in the marketplace we are very excited about the results of our efforts before getting into more

billion in  with adjusted eps rising  percent excluding the threecent per share tax benefit in the prior year cvs caremark shares returned  percent significantly outpacing our retail pharmacy and pbm peers as well as the broader sp  index and dow jones industrial average we are extremely pleased with our performance and highly focused on further enhancing shareholder value our roadmap for

with another  billion related to pbm contracts that came with our  purchase of universal americans medicare part d business in fact when we combine the  and  selling seasons with the universal

is expected to save us more than  billion cumulatively through  our specialty pharmacy revenue has risen by more than  percent annually over the past two years and is expected to account for  billion in sales in  we stand to benefit from this sectors robust rd pipeline and have numerous offerings that help pbm clients manage their specialty spending more effectively the government is rapidly emerging as the major payor for prescription drugs in the united states forecasts vary but medicare and medicaid could be paying for as much as twothirds of all us prescriptions by  up from approximately onethird today our integrated business model is very wellpositioned to serve these populations we are focused on building a leadership position in the part d business and investing in stateoftheart systems to handle its challenging regulatory requirements and complex benefit designs were reinventing the role of our retail pharmacists leading in adherence and gaining share our focus on superior customer service increased access and patient care improvements continued to drive share gains in our retail pharmacies pharmacy samestore sales increased  percent in  that pushed cvspharmacys share of the total us retail prescription market to  percent up nearly six percentage points since  much of the credit goes to the evolving role of our pharmacists who have seen their traditional role as dispensers of medications expand greatly to focus on providing broader health care services today cvs pharmacists are trained to administer vaccinations and to consult with patients on opportunities to improve adherence close gaps in care and lower their costs based on our data cvspharmacy now has the highest adherence rate among top us pharmacy retailers this is critical because nonadherence  that is not refilling prescriptions or not refilling them on time  costs the us health care system an estimated  billion annually in avoidable health care costs our pharmacies also have the highest generic dispensing rate or gdr in our industry which is helping pbm clients and patients save money although the lower prices of generic drugs can exert a drag on revenue growth their greater margins help drive profitability we see significant opportunities on the horizon to further increase our gdr in  alone approximately  billion of branded drug sales will lose patent protection our extracare loyalty program clustering initiatives and store brands remain key drivers of frontstore profitability our frontstore business also turned in another year of solid performance in a weak economy with frontstore samestore sales increasing  percent introduced back in  our extracare loyalty program provides us with a powerful competitive advantage the largest and most successful retail loyalty program it has more than  million active households and currently accounts for approximately  percent of our frontstore sales extracare enables us to execute a targeted frontstore promotional strategy and drive more profitable saleswe also leveraged the deep customer insights gained through extracare to launch our store clustering initiative in  to date we have remodeled more than  stores to tailor our merchandise mix based on the way our stores are shopped in certain locations we have rolled out two different clusters thus far  food convenience and urban  and are seeing revenue and profitability increases in each in  we will expand our store segmentation approach by rolling out additional cluster prototypes that will enable us to customize our store fleet and meet the unique needs of each stores customer base the store brand category which now accounts for approximately  percent of frontstore sales represents another growth driver in the front of our stores these products are less expensive for shoppers help create loyalty and provide us with higher margins we believe that store brands can reach  percent of frontstore sales over the next few years and we are adding hundreds of new products every year our real estate program continued on pace as we opened  new or relocated stores factoring in closings net units increased by  stores that equates to  percent retail square footage growth consistent with the level of the past several years minuteclinic has broadened its scope and forged key strategic alliances we now operate approximately  minuteclinics most of which are in cvspharmacy stores across  states with that number expected to rise to  by  we believe minuteclinic will play an important role in addressing some of the cost challenges related to health care in this country as well as access issues resulting from the national shortage of primary care physicians this situation will only be exacerbated when  million americans obtain health insurance beginning in  through health care reform minuteclinic has been expanding its scope of services to focus more on preventive care and monitoring for chronic conditions such as diabetes hypertension and high cholesterol we are also partnering on patient education and disease management initiatives through the formal affiliations weve established with some of the nations leading health systems taken together these health systems represent more than  hospitals and  physicians as part of our clinical collaboration some of these doctors now serve as medical directors for their local minuteclinics we are integrating our electronic medical records with those affiliated health systems and in the future we expect to play a collaborative role with the accountable care organizations that are an outgrowth of health care reform the collaboration of minuteclinic with our pbm represents just one of our integration sweet spots allowing us to create programs for pbm members that are difficult for any of our competitors to match for example clients have the opportunity to change their benefit structure to substantially reduce or eliminate copays at minuteclinic which will encourage costeffective member behaviors and expand access to highquality care minuteclinic also offers our pbm clients flu vaccination and biometric screeningprograms injection training and onsite employerbased clinics clients are embracing our unique integrated offerings while we continue to expand them our integrated offerings leverage the clinical expertise and insights from our pbm business along with the broad reach and facetoface engagement in our retail business to deliver innovative solutions that are unmatched in the marketplace today these solutions enhance access lower health care costs and improve health outcomes and we have compelling data proving the efficacy of our unique programs among our integrated offerings we have seen an enthusiastic response to our pharmacy advisor program which had more than  million lives enrolled at the end of  after just one year of being broadly available that represents approximately  percent of our pbm book of business capitalizing on our retail presence  unique among major pbms  we can offer chronically ill patients the benefit of facetoface counseling in our pharmacies to improve their medication adherence rates and close gaps in care we are particularly encouraged that many new customers have opted to implement maintenance choice this program gives qualifying plan participants the option of filling their day maintenance prescriptions by mail or at one of our convenient retail locations at the same copay and payor pricing as mail order something that is very difficult for a standalone pbm or retailer to offer clients representing more than  million members adopted maintenance choice as of january  our new enhancements to this offering which we have dubbed maintenance choice  have the potential to more than triple the number of members participating in maintenance choice by making it more broadly available to the pbm book of business and also making it easier for consumers to use you can read about pharmacy advisor and maintenance choice in more detail on pages  in closing i must extend my thanks to our  colleagues who are the collective face of cvs caremark their dedication and commitment to our clients customers and communities continues to play an integral role in the success of our company,3.462,1.0
159,CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2012,health care delivery in the united states is going through a period of rapid change this is being driven primarily by the ongoing implementation of the affordable care act along with an aging population a growing shortage of primary care physicians rising prevalence of chronic disease and shifts in consumer and patient behavior some  million americans are expected to gain health care coverage in the coming years as a result of the new legislation and demographic shifts despite health reform legislation health care costs are projected to continue to

largest retail medical clinic system continues to enter new markets expand services and increase its growing number of affiliations with leading health care systems our unmatched business model enables us to offer products and services that are difficult for our standalone competitors to replicate for example we have developed solutions such as pharmacy advisor to address gaps in care and medication nonadherence that no other pharmacy company presently offers our capabilities in this area are critical because patients who do not adhere to their prescription drug regimens cost the us health care system an estimated  billion annually in avoidable health care costs before i expand on these and other topics i want to provide a brief overview of our  results by virtually any measure the past year was an outstanding one for cvs caremark solid growth and significant free cash flow are driving shareholder value net revenues increased  percent to a record  billion in  excluding the loss on early extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose  percent to  we achieved solid growth in our core pharmacy services and retail businesses and our stores captured a significant share of express scripts members during its impasse with walgreens we also controlled expenses and increased productivity across the enterprise our shares performed well returning  percent for the year that surpassed the total returns of both the sp  index and dow jones industrial average over the same period in fact we outperformed these broader indices on a three and fiveyear basis as well we remain focused on enhancing shareholder value by driving productive longterm growth generating significant cash flow and optimizing capital deployment in  free cash flow totaled  billion and we returned more than  billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we increased our quarterly dividend by  percent in  and we recently announced another  percent increase for  this most recent increase allows us to meet the low end of our  to  percent dividend payout ratio target two years early and marks our th consecutive year of dividend increases with our strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating we also were able to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment to refinance a portion of our longterm debt our enhanced debt structure will help improve earnings and further enhance our free cash flow in future years our pbm won business across customer segments and is wellpositioned in major growth areas our integrated model has been embraced by the marketplace and now represents a sustainable competitive advantage in the industry clients recognize that our differentiated pbm offerings such as pharmacy advisor and maintenance choice can make a real difference in enhancing access lowering health care costs and improving health outcomesweve grown our pbm book of business by approximately  percent since  delivering  billion of net new business over this period in the  selling season we retained  percent of our book of business we also won well over  billion in gross new business and approximately  million in net new business its worth noting that these gains came across customer segments including employers commercial health plans medicare part d and medicaid medicare has quickly emerged as a major payor for prescription drugs in the united states and our pbm is currently a strong number three player in the part d market with roughly  million lives this includes the lives we serve through our silverscript prescription drug plans as well as other lives where we serve as the pbm for health plan clients with baby boomers turning  at the rate of  people per day along with their growing utilization of prescription medications we see the medicare market as an attractive growth area managed medicaid represents another critical growth segment for us as health care reform could add up to  million new lives to medicaid rolls in the coming years we are currently the clear leader in the managed medicaid pbm market with an estimated  percent share we have continued to win new clients and have also seen existing clients expand membership as states move from a feeforservice model our success is due in part to our ability to tailor our programs and operations to support the unique needs of this segment our specialty pharmacy business continues to grow rapidly with enterprisewide specialty revenues of more than  billion in  the specialty market is expected to grow to approximately  billion in  roughly double the size of the market in  that means that by late  it could account for roughly onethird of total pharmacy spend in the united states this rapid increase in specialty drug costs presents challenges for our clients so we have expanded our capabilities to manage specialty trend across the entire continuum of pharmacy and medical benefits when implementing our programs which include specialty guideline management exclusive pharmacy networks and site of care management clients can save up to  to  percent on their specialty spend there is plenty of other good news coming out of our pbm from our collaboration with aetna to our streamlining initiative the latter which involves rationalizing our mail order pharmacies streamlining operations and consolidating our claims adjudication systems is on track to deliver  billion in cumulative cost savings over the fiveyear period ending in  cvspharmacy gained share and outperformed competitors on key metrics our retail business continued to fire on all cylinders in  and we gained market share in both the pharmacy and the front of the store in fact our retail share of the prescription drug market has grown two percentage points in the past two years to reach more than  percent we also far outpaced our peer group with  percent growth in prescriptions dispensed even factoring out the prescriptions gained during the express scriptswalgreens impasse our underlying pharmacy growth led the industry our focus on excellence in patient care is a key driver of our strong performance in the pharmacy as part of our patient care initiatives our pharmacy teams performed  million customer interventions in  interventions like these keep our adherence rates well above all other pharmacy retailers helping our patients stay healthy and driving savings for payors another way in which we can control health care costs is by moving patients to lowercost generic drug alternatives when available and clinically appropriate given that generics produce greater profits for us than branded drugs we can improve profitability even as we lower costs for patients and payors the opportunity for us in this area remains significant for the next few yearsthe extracare loyalty program and our store brands continued to drive front store gains in the front of the store our  percent rise in same store sales led the industry in  we continue to use our extracare loyalty program to help deliver a more personalized experience to each customer we have been building refining and perfecting this industryleading program for  years today we have  million active cardholders who accounted for  percent of frontstore sales during the past year we leverage the insights gained from card use to support each of these customers with promotions targeted to their specific tastes and needs well be taking our efforts to the next level in the coming year by among other things personalizing the digital circular customers see when logging onto the extracare page at cvscom and by offering incentives that encourage customers to shop categories that are new to them the insights gleaned from extracare also helped provide a foundation for the mycvs clustering initiative currently underway in brief weve begun to tailor our merchandise mix and remodel store layouts to match the needs of customers within certain trade areas for example we began rolling out what we call our urban cluster in  designed as a general store for dense trade areas this concept increases our consumable offerings and also features faster checkouts we had  of these stores in place at the end of  and they saw notable sales and margin gains in  we expect to convert another  stores to the urban format building upon the success weve experienced with these urban cluster stores were currently experimenting with other clusters to better tailor our stores to match our customer base our store brands represent another opportunity to enhance customer value while increasing profitability these products are sold under a variety of proprietary labels such as gold emblemtm and just the basicstm they represent more than  percent of our front store sales and they accounted for  percent of our front store sales growth over the past four years we have an aggressive plan in place to improve both the quality and packaging of our store brands and we believe that they can reach at least  percent of front store sales in the next few years as we work to drive growth in existing stores we have also continued to open locations and to enter new markets in  we opened  new or relocated stores in the united states factoring in closings net units increased by  stores that equates to  percent retail square footage growth for the year in line with our annual goal moreover our acquisition of privately held drogaria onofre in january  marked our first foray into drugstore operations outside the united states this transaction includes  retail locations in and around sao paulo brazil which we view as a highly attractive growth market ive said many times that our approach to international expansion would be measured and that we will continue to exercise strong financial discipline onofre with its strong reputation represents an excellent opportunity to grow the business over time minuteclinics expansion included increased focus on nonacute care new locations and health system affiliations a year from now millions of americans will begin to gain access to coverage as part of us health care reform this coming growth in demand will further exacerbate the current shortage of primary care physicians our expanding network of minuteclinic locations will help address both the access issues related to this shortage as well as the rising cost of delivering care the largest and fastestgrowing retail medical clinic provider in the country minuteclinic has approximately  locations within cvspharmacy stores in  states and the district of columbia each offers convenient costeffective care seven days a week without appointment insurers understand minuteclinics value proposition which is why visits are covered by more than  different commercial and government health plansminuteclinics  nurse practitioners and physician assistants have cared for nearly  million patients more than eight million of them in the past three years alone although acute care accounts for the majority of visits nonacute services such as immunizations physicals and chronic disease monitoring have increased at a compound annual growth rate of  percent over the past three years in  these services accounted for about  percent of total volume a figure that should continue to rise in the coming years we expect to open  new clinics in  with a longterm goal of operating  clinics in more than  states by  minuteclinics expanding footprint supports our growth strategy on a number of fronts collaborating with our pbm on service offerings strengthens our appeal and value proposition to regional and national accounts it also increases minuteclinics value as a partner to some of the nations leading health systems and positions us to play an important role in new health care delivery systems such as accountable care organizations we are keenly focused on future growth opportunities given all the change that is underway in health care it is critically important that we are able to pivot to serve the changing needs of our clients and customers we believe that our business model is well aligned with the longerterm trends in the industry and uniquely positions us to drive value for our clients and customers in this rapidly changing environment given this weve done a substantial amount of work to more clearly define our longterm strategic growth framework to ensure that we capitalize on these significant opportunities our enterprise growth

into our silverscript prescription drug plans pdps as they age into the medicare program although price is still a very important part of their decision process clients are telling us that were also being selected because of the unique capabilities we deliver among them our pharmacy advisor program helps participating plan members with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions to identify gaps in care adhere to their prescribed medications and better manage their health conditions we have also expanded this program to medicare beneficiaries which is helping health plan clients achieve better clinical star ratings maintenance choice remains a unique offering in the market that no competitor has been able to replicate it allows plan members to receive their day maintenance prescriptions by mail or at one of our convenient retail stores for the same price client adoption has risen significantly over the past two years with  million members currently

that specialty medications represent the pinnacle of achievement in biologic science and have revolutionized the treatment of a host of debilitating and lifethreatening illnesses at the same time managing these expensive agents and the specialty patient population brings its own share of complexities and our clients are clamoring for help in controlling the rapidly rising costs cvs caremark has assembled what we believe to be the most complete and coordinated solution in our industry to address the needs of specialty patients and payors our solutions include comprehensive trend management in which cvs caremark aggressively manages all drugs irrespective of route of administration or site of service or whether a drug is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit our

connect has revealed that half of specialty patients prefer to pick up their drugs at a cvspharmacy location and that this program is helping to drive improved adherence rates finally our acquisition of coram has significantly expanded our capabilities in the infusion market coram serves  patients annually through its  branch locations and  home infusion nurses around the country coram also complements our existing specialty competencies creating crossselling opportunities and making us a compelling option for narrow networks that are trying to improve outcomes while driving down costs cvspharmacy stores are in the right growth markets and outperforming competitors on medication adherence our retail business posted solid results in  especially given the continued evidence of a cautious consumer samestore sales grew by  percent overall with the pharmacy up  percent and the front of the store down  percent our stores now command a  percent share of the us retail prescription drug market and we are poised to capitalize on health care reform over the next few years with  million americans expected to gain health care coverage through the public exchanges and the expansion

insurance rolls  california texas and florida topping the list  we already have strong market positions with plans to expand in counties where the greatest opportunities existour pharmacists executed close to  million live clinical interventions during the year that helped cvspharmacy deliver bestinclass adherence results compared to our top three retail competitors in areas that include diabetes therapy cholesterol therapy and blood pressure therapy among patients that take medication for high blood pressure our adherence rate translates into the prevention of  heart attacks  strokes and  deaths each year these outcomes are obviously meaningful to our patients and their families they also broadly benefit a health care system that incurs  billion in avoidable medical costs each year due to medication nonadherence extracare and storebrand initiatives continue to drive profitable sales in the front of the store our extracare loyalty program has been a key driver of our profitable front store sales and it is helping us deliver a more personalized experience to each customer the industrys longestrunning loyalty program extracare has  million active cardholders who accounted for  percent of front store transactions during the past year these cardholders get two percent back every day and received  billion in extrabucks savings and rewards in  its important to note that we have spent  years gathering insights and perfecting extracare which means that no competitor can match the depth of our customer analytics weve leveraged our extracare insights to convert customers to categories they shop elsewhere to launch personalized digital circulars and to tailor our merchandise mix to better meet customer needs our store and proprietary brands represent another key driver of profitable front store sales growth these products are sold under a variety of proprietary labels such as gold emblem and essence of beauty and accounted for  percent of front store sales in  importantly they also provide significantly higher margins than national brands while saving our customers money we have an aggressive strategy in place to move their penetration to well over  percent in the next few years minuteclinic provides unmatched offerings to our pbm clients and aligns with leading health systems minuteclinic today represents a small percentage of our revenues but it is significant to our overall health care strategy and is expected to play an important role in the rapidly evolving health care system our  nurse practitioners and physician assistants provide highquality affordable walkin medical care services seven days a week without appointments with more than  clinics currently in  states and the district of columbia minuteclinic is expected to grow to  locations in over  states by  through this expanding network of locations minuteclinic will play an important role in helping alleviate the growing shortage of primary care physicians in the united states especially as more people obtain health insurance minuteclinic now has more than  major health system affiliations adding seven in  alone we are working with the nations leading health care

offers chronic disease and wellness services while integrating medical records with primary care providers as we look for new ways of improving care while lowering costs we will offer innovative new services such as telehealth at minuteclinic which is currently being piloted in certain markets the new health care environment presents growth opportunities across our enterprise with health care reform and major demographic shifts underway in the united states our industry landscape is poised to change significantly in the coming years there are a number of moving parts related to coverage expansion and the initial rollout of the aca has come with its challenges that said we continue to expect that coverage expansion will provide a longterm tailwind for the industry the importance of government payors and health plans is clearly rising and we believe that cvs caremark is very wellpositioned for this trend we have strong positions in the medicare and medicaid markets across both our retail and pbm businesses lets look at managed medicaid where  million people are currently enrolled this number is expected to increase to  million people by  growth will come from the continuing transition of feeforservice medicaid members to managed medicaid as well as from new enrollees resulting from the acas expanded eligibility cvs caremark is the clear market leader among managed medicaid pbms with a  percent share of covered lives and our capabilities will help us maintain this position we also have a  percent share of medicaid prescription volumes through our retail stores our retail footprint and capabilities give us an opportunity to gain even greater share as managed medicaid providers show an interest in narrowing their retail pharmacy networks to save costs the medicare part d market remains a very important part of our growth strategy as well with  million people aging into medicare by  drug spending in the medicare space is expected to grow at an  percent compounded annual growth rate we remain the number three player in the pbm market covering  million lives through our silverscript product or through our health plan clients where we serve as the pbm we will also participate in coverage expansion through both public and private health insurance exchanges looking at the private exchanges we can reach active employees not only through our commercial health plan partners but also through direct relationships on key exchanges we connect with medicareeligible retirees through our mapd and pdp health plan partners and our cvs caremark silverscript pdp looking at public exchanges our pbm covers  percent of the eligible exchange population through our health plan customer relationships access to the exchange population rises further if you factor in states where we have cvspharmacy preferrednetwork relationships with the growth in exchanges and government lines of business our ability to serve health plans whether or not they are pbm clients is increasingly important leveraging our retail footprint we can support health plan marketing initiatives ranging from limited pilot marketing programs to fullscale educational programs some of our health plan partnerships also include participation in preferred or restricted pharmacy networks many plans are taking advantage of minuteclinics convenient and affordable services as well as costsaving pbm services and programs to better manage rising specialty pharmacy costs our recently announced decision to remove cigarettes and all tobacco products from our store shelves by october  has generated an overwhelmingly positive response from customers health plan and employer clients legislators and public health and medicaid officials they all see the health benefit of this move and the role that pharmacy can play in smoking cessation some  million people in this country already have at least one disease from smoking and it still accounts for approximately  deaths each year simply put the sale of tobacco is inconsistent with our corporate purpose of helping people on their path to better health as the delivery of health care evolves with an emphasis on better health outcomes reducing chronic disease and controlling costs were playing an expanded role in providing care through our pharmacists nurse practitioners and physician assistants this significant action further distinguishes us in how we are serving our patients clients and health care providers and better positions us for continued growth in the evolving health care marketplace although this decision will have some impact on revenues and profits we believe that it is the right thing to do given our expanding role as a health care company clearly we are in the midst of an exciting and pivotal moment for our company and our industry in closing i want to thank our board of directors our shareholders and the more than  colleagues who have played such an important role in cvs caremarks achievements they have worked hard to develop our sustainable competitive advantage and to meet the needs of the health care system of the future,4.592,1.0

have outperformed these indices on a three five and year basis as well our  stock performance also outpaced the  percent return of the sp  health care index our core strengths and integrated offerings drove another successful pbm selling season our cvscaremark pbm offers competitive pricing high levels of service and execution and unmatched services that continue to resonate with payors as a result  revenues increased by  percent to  billion in our pharmacy services segment after a successful selling season we started  with  billion in gross new business spread among health plans government payors and employers with a  percent retention rate net new business for  totaled  billion clients value the strength of cvscaremarks adherence programs specialty services and advanced formulary strategies pharmacy advisor maintenance choice specialty connect and our other integrated offerings have played an increasingly important role in our ability to win and retain business at present no other pbm can offer these differentiated services and capabilities pharmacy advisor our industryleading clinical program for plan members with chronic diseases currently addresses diabetes cardiovascular conditions and eight other disease states now available to our medicare and medicaid plans as well it is helping them improve the clinical star measures that impact their reimbursement rates with more than  million plan members enrolled in maintenance choice in  growth in participation has exceeded  percent in just three years we are also seeing growing interest in our new specialty connect delivery option similar to maintenance choice it offers specialty patients the flexibility to receive their prescriptions by mail or at one of our stores cvscaremarks retail network claims have risen significantly over the past six years from about  million to  million prescriptions over the same period cvspharmacys share of the cvscaremark book of business has grown from  percent to approximately  percent we are gaining a growing share of a growing business highlighting the success of our channelagnostic approach and the power of our integrated business model pbm clients are also increasingly incorporating cvsminuteclinic services into their plans improving member access to health care while lowering overall costs for example our pilot plan to reduce or eliminate copayments for plan members now covers  million lives thats up from  in  we are reinventing specialty with a unique suite of assets to address rising costs our specialty pharmacy business continues to grow rapidly with revenues from the specialty drugs we dispensed and managed across the enterprise totaling  billion in  the overall specialty market is projected to reach  billion and  percent of total drug spend by compared with just  percent this past yearas utilization of costly new therapies ncreases hepatitis c drugs such as sovaldi and harvoni as well as pcsk inhibitors an anticipated new class of drugs for lowering cholesterol are notable examples of highcost therapies expected to drive the rapid growth in specialty pharmacy this trend imposes a substantial burden on both patients and payors as they seek ways to control costs our clients count on us to manage these expensive specialty medications to ensure appropriate utilization through a combination of prior authorization formulary management and other innovative clinical programs thats why weve been working hard to reinvent specialty pharmacyin specialty we led the market in  with formulary strategies using clinically appropriate and costeffective solutions and we continued to lead in  we also have unparalleled capabilities to manage specialty patients holistically not just their drug costs and our clinical support and siteofcare management helps drive superior outcomes weve integrated our accordant rare disease care management services to enhance care and reduce costs rolled out specialty connect and made key acquisitions such as coram and novologix to broaden our portfolio cvspharmacy posted solid results despite exit from tobacco category and continued to gain share cvspharmacy continued to gain market share in both the pharmacy and the front of the store in  even as consumers remained cost conscious our core pharmacy business has grown three times faster than that of other drug chains over the same period and we hold a  percent share of the us retail prescription drug market for the year samestore sales rose  percent with the pharmacy up  percent and the front of the store down  percent our underlying front store growth was obscured by the negative impact on revenue from exiting the tobacco category it has now been five months since we became the first national pharmacy chain to eliminate cigarettes and other tobacco products from our shelves a move that reflects our corporate purpose and is expected to help drive longterm growth as expected exiting the tobacco category will cost us approximately  billion in revenues on an annualized basis billion from tobacco sales specifically and approximately another  million from the rest of those shoppers baskets that amounted to about  cents in earnings per share in  and it is expected to cost an incremental  to  cents per share in  for a total annual impact of approximately  cents per share yet our decision better aligns us with payors and providers as they search for ways to improve health outcomes and control costs that should make us a more attractive partner for dispensing and other services ultimately helping us recapture this lost revenue elsewhere across the enterprise health and beauty remained key drivers of front store sales in  with market shares rising to  and  percent respectively our store brands continued to generate profitable sales growth accounting for  percent of front store sales given our success weve set a new goal of increasing store brand penetration to  percent of front store sales like generic drugs in the pharmacy store brands provide significantly higher margins than national brands while also saving our customers money the past year saw our successful launch of the makeup academy and radiance platinum lines as well as more than  items under the new gold emblem abound healthy snack brand as we look to the future we will continue to provide our customers with additional healthy options our goal is to make cvspharmacy the convenience destination for more better and healthier choices in research we have conducted since the tobacco announcement customers have made healthy food their number one choice among offerings they would like to see added moreover these products are less sensitive to promotion which aligns with our strategy to drive profitable growth our adherence programs and partnerships are providing value to our pbm and nonpbm patients alike our channelagnostic pharmacy care model has played a key role in enhancing member services and driving share gains plan members are embracing our unique offerings and weve also endeavored to improve our value to our retail customers who are covered by other pbms they are benefiting from our bestinclass clinical programs to help treat chronic conditions as well as from the innovative partnerships we have forged with providers and payors adherence to prescription drug regimens is critical to improving patient health and reducing costs and cvspharmacys adherence rates lead the industry for example our medication possession ratios for customers undergoing therapy for diabetes high cholesterol or high blood pressure are eight percentage points higher than those of our top three retail competitors that translates into lower mortality rates fewer heart attacks and strokes better quality of life and a reduction in overall health care costs among our partnerships were working with hospital providers to ensure that patients have the proper outpatient medications in hand before discharge we follow up after patients return home to answer questions and confirm medication adherence with the rise of consumerism driven in large part by the increasing numbers of individuals in consumerdriven health plans what were calling the retailization of health care cvspharmacy has also partnered with a number of health plan clients on a variety of initiatives that help them reach out to consumers directly for example we host instore events to drive member acquisition and have launched a solution that enables health plan members to pay their insurance premiums at their local cvspharmacy weve also introduced heathtag which allows us to deliver messages from our health plan partners to patients such as a reminder to get an ac blood sugar screening when picking up a prescription importantly these relationships position us to be anchors in their limited or preferred networks we continue to enter new markets and use extracare to drive profitable growth the vast majority of the us population lives within a few miles of a cvspharmacy and weve continued to expand our footprint in existing markets as well as by entering new markets such as seattle overall we opened or acquired  new stores in  factoring in closings net units increased by  stores that equates to two percent retail square footage growth for the year in line with our annual goal our september  acquisition of miamibased navarro discount pharmacy has strengthened our position in the hispanic marketplace the fastest growing demographic in the united states over the next decade the us hispanic population is expected to increase by  percent to  million lives navarro has been serving hispanic consumers for more than  years and now has  retail drugstore locations we are leveraging its expertise to help make cvspharmacy stores in hispanic neighborhoods across the country even more relevant to the customers we serve every day in all our locations the extracare loyalty program continues to play an indispensable role in driving profitable front store sales the industrys longestrunning loyalty program is now in its th year and was used in more than  percent of front store sales in  it has allowed us to gather critical consumer insights that we use every day to enhance the cvspharmacy shopping experience and to invest in those customers who provide the most value for example were now leveraging the knowledge weve gained through extracare to deliver personalized offers to our  million active cardholders this includes  million emails a week and  million mail pieces annually in  cardholders redeemed a total of  million personalized coupons the ongoing decline in newspaper circulation will only increase our advantage over competitors who rely more heavily on circulars to drive trips to their stores as always cardholders also get  percent back on purchases every day and received  billion in extrabucks savings and rewards in  cvs healths robust digital strategy empowers consumers to navigate their pharmacy experiences and manage their conditions through our online and mobile tools this includes the ability to get nextinline text alerts at cvsminuteclinic and in the future the ability to schedule appointments our mobile app has received critical acclaim for ease of use while our text message program has experienced significant growth cvsminuteclinic excels at customer satisfaction while broadening its preventative and chronic care offerings cvsminuteclinic continued its rapid growth ending the year with more than  clinics in  states and the district of columbia up from  clinics in the prior year since its inception cvsminuteclinics  nurse practitioners and physician assistants have provided care for more than  million patient visits we will continue to add more locations and enter new markets in  and remain on track to reach  locations by the end of  along with our rapid growth we have continued to deliver the high levels of satisfaction and quality for which cvsminuteclinic is known our net promoter score a thirdparty measure of how likely it is that our services would be recommended to friends or colleagues has grown over the past two years among health care organizations our scores are unmatched our own research published in the october  edition of the american journal of managed care shows that cvsminuteclinics quality performance matches or exceeds that of other ambulatory care settings for three common health conditionsalthough cvsminuteclinic is largely known for treating sore throats ear infections and other acute conditions we are focused on expanding its scope of services that includes adding chronic disease monitoring and treatment for conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia we have expanded our biometric monitoring tobacco cessation and weight loss programs we undertake chronic care only when working with primary care doctors to complement the services they offer our affiliations with major health systems throughout the united statesand twoway integration of our electronic medical recordsheighten our ability to provide collaborative care we added  health systems in  ending the year with  such affiliations growth of government programs and exchanges presents significant opportunities across our enterprise government programs represent a tremendous growth opportunity for us and we have strong positions in both the medicare and medicaid markets the united states is in the midst of what we are calling a silver tsunami with some  baby boomers turning  every day this means that more than  million new people will be eligible for medicare by  cvs health serves this market through our silverscript medicare part d prescription drug plan as the pbm for our health plan medicare clients and through employer group waiver plans as a result of the affordable care act we have seen significant growth in medicaid over the past year with states expanding eligibility this growth will likely continue as more states evaluate their medicaid expansion decisions at the same time the growth of managed medicaid over traditional feeforservice models has been fueled by states seeking cost savings opportunities cvscaremark participates in managed medicaid through health plan clients and our  percent share makes us an industry leader medicaid also currently accounts for  percent of prescriptions dispensed at cvspharmacy locations our retail footprint and capabilities give us an opportunity to gain even greater share as managed medicaid providers narrow their retail pharmacy networks to save costs the next several years are expected to bring continued growth in the number of people seeking insurance through the public exchanges additionally we believe some employers will explore private exchanges as a viable option to reduce health care spending for their retirees cvscaremark participates on the public and private exchanges on a carvein basis with health plan clients on the private exchanges we also participate on a carveout basis as a standalone pbm where we offer prescription benefits directly we expect the growth in exchange lives to provide an incremental lift to our retail pharmacy as utilization increases clearly we are seeing tremendous opportunities for growth throughout the enterprise and i believe that our integrated model will allow us to take full advantage of them in closing i want to thank our board of directors and the  colleagues who work so diligently across cvs health they have committed themselves to our unique model of pharmacy care and have given us a compelling advantage in todays marketplace to my fellow shareholders thank you for your continued confidence in our strategy,4.644,1.0

an evolving health care market that strategy is focused on creating superior value for patients payors and providers through an unmatched suite of integrated assets from our nationwide retail footprint to our leading pharmacy benefits management pbm and specialty businesses and now our leading presence in longterm pharmacy care we have forged a competitive advantage that is helping us benefit from a broad range of market trends they include the implementation of the affordable care act the aging us population and increased prescription utilization of the roughly  million

down overall health care costs our growing volumesalong with our red oak generic sourcing venture with cardinal healthcreate unparalleled scale and purchasing expertise that help them best accomplish this and we certainly arent standing still we broadened our reach in  with the acquisition of omnicare the nations leading provider of pharmacy services to the longterm care market omnicare dispenses  million scripts annually to approximately  million patients we also grew our core pharmacy business with the purchase of more than  pharmacies and nearly  retail clinics from target corporation this transaction which closed in december expanded our pharmacy count by  percent and our number of clinics by  percent ill have more to say about both of these acquisitions but let me first offer a brief overview of cvs healths financial performancerecord revenue and earnings helped us return more than  billion to shareholders once again we met or exceeded all of our key financial targets through our ongoing focus on three pillars that we consider essential to maximizing shareholder value  productive longterm growth  generating significant free cash flow and  optimizing capital allocation net revenues for the year increased  percent to a record  billion while adjusted earnings per share eps rose nearly  percent to  on a comparable basis that excludes amortization acquisitionrelated costs and a charge related to a disputed  legal settlement in  it excludes amortization and the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in  looking back at the steady state targets we introduced in  for the subsequent fiveyear period i am happy to report that the companys growth hit the higher end of each target range operating profit has risen at a  percent compounded annual growth rate cagr while adjusted eps has grown at a  percent cagr cvs health generated  billion in free cash flow during  and returned more than  billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by  percent and approved an additional  percent increase for  that marks our th consecutive year of increases and keeps us on track to reach a  percent dividend payout ratio target by  we expect to return more than  billion to shareholders in  through dividends and share repurchases the omnicare and target deals represent efficient strategic uses of our capital that will help drive longterm growth even after financing both acquisitions through debt we still have a strong balance sheet with wellladdered debt maturities we maintain a high tripleb credit rating that allows cvs health to continue to effectively finance the working capital needs of the company while the stock market has been tumultuous cvs health shares produced a total return of  percent in  to outperform the major indices over the same period the sp  index and the dow jones industrial average returned  percent and  percent respectively we have notably outperformed these indices on a three five and year basis as well high retention rates and new business wins reflect the value of the cvs caremark pbm model the capabilities of cvs caremark remain unmatched in the pbm marketplace fueling strong top and bottomline growth in  another highly successful selling season resulted in  billion in gross new client business to start  while health plans accounted for roughly  percent of our wins we were also very successful in the employer segment with more than  new clients totaling  billion in revenue with a  percent client retention rate net new client business for  totaled  billion we are winning with our strong record of service and execution our competitive pricing and by bringing unique solutions to the market to meet a broad range of client concerns surveys have shown that cost control is our clients top priority this is followed by a variety of additional factors with each of our client channels having different priorities our flexibility and expertise in addressing them has certainly been key to our success we led the market with the first formulary exclusions in  ensuring patient access to highquality medications at the lowest possible cost to clients since that time weve identified additional exclusions on an annual basis most recently we took bold steps in  with hepatitis c medications and pcsk inhibitors these expensive therapies are key potential drivers of rising costsor trendfor clients through our strategies we expect to have saved clients  billion for the fiveyear period through  oversight and strategic pharmacy management cut our clients trend by more than half in  despite record levels of drug price increases this past year we also launched a valuable surveillance and reporting toolinteractive rx insightsthat allows our sales team to simulate the impact of plan designs and show clients how specific solutions reduce the impact of trend drivers our medicare part d med d business had another successful annual enrollment period for  the silverscript prescription drug plan pdp added  lives raising total enrollment to  million captive pdp lives including employee group waiver plans when adding the med d lives we manage for our health plan clients the total rises to more than  million med d lives under management up  percent from the prior year and making us the clear leader in the med d space through our enterprise clinical capabilities we have an unmatched ability to drive med d star ratingsfor silverscript as well as our health plan clients offerings in fact silverscript was the largest pdp to achieve a fourstar rating and  percent of our clients lives were enrolled in a high performing plan for the  plan year our specialty business with its breadth of offerings has been a key driver of revenue gains throughout  we continued to capture an outsized share of the specialty market the industrys fastestgrowing sector our cvs specialtytm business is the nations largest and our growth has outpaced both the industry overall and that of our nearest competitor in  revenues from the specialty drugs we dispensed and managed across the enterprise totaled nearly  billion increasing  percent over the prior year cvs specialty offers all the traditional capabilities that payors expect from a specialty pharmacy weve raised the bar as well by offering a unique range of differentiated solutions through our integrated model take our highly popular specialty connecttm offering which gives specialty patients the option of picking up their medications at any cvs pharmacy location or having the medication delivered by mail more than  percent of our specialty patients prefer instore pickupalong with the opportunity to consult with a pharmacist facetofaceand weve served more than  of them in this way since we rolled out the program in  among specialty patients that opt for instore pickup weve seen adherence improve by  percent our differentiated offerings also include accordant rare disease case management and coram infusion services both of which make cvs specialty particularly attractive to manufacturers who want to launch new drugs through limited distribution networks only cvs specialty has the novologix technology platform enabling us to help our clients manage all specialty medications including those paid under the medical benefit retail pharmacy growth has outpaced our competitors while the target deal further broadens our reach at cvs pharmacy same store sales increased  percent in  pharmacy same store sales rose  percent while front store same store sales decreased  percent driven primarily by our exit from tobacco sales in  cvs pharmacy filled  percent of all retail prescriptions in  to lead the us retail drugstore market in fact our retail prescription business has grown at twice the rate of the overall market since  although our integrated model has certainly played a key role in these results nearly  percent of our prescription growth since  has been driven by share gains from noncvs caremark payors this is due in part to the many programs we have put in place to provide all customers with excellent service and value our growth has also led to valuable economies of scale for example our labor cost to fill prescriptions has fallen by approximately  percent excluding wage inflation over the past five years our stores are also playing an important role in what we call the retailization of health care with the rise in consumerdirected health plans it is imperative that patients stay on their medications we encourage appropriate patient behavior through our industryleading adherence programs additionally the affordable care act has led increasing numbers of individuals to choose their own health plans on public exchanges we can effectively support health plan partners with instore displays and service centers that support their outreach efforts ive already touched on the target deal which has expanded our presence to regions such as seattle denver portland and salt lake city across the enterprise you can now find a cvs health location in every us state we are currently in the process of rebranding these assets as cvs pharmacy and minuteclinic locations cvs pharmacy stores have typically filled twice the number of prescriptions as target pharmacies so these new locations represent a significant opportunity to drive script growth and profitability in addition to the acquired target locations we opened  new stores in  factoring in closings net units increased by  stores for our pbm business members now have approximately  cvs pharmacy locations to choose from thats up from about  in  this enhances the relevance of pharmacy advisor maintenance choice and our other integrated offerings since more members will benefit from easier access to them health and beauty and extracare are driving front store gains cvs minuteclinic expands its scope of services in the front of the store our average basket size in  after excluding the impact of our exit from tobacco increased  percentand  percent in our core health and beauty businesses these results are gratifying given the lackluster trend in overall shopping visits across the retail landscape health and beauty offer higher margins and growth opportunities than other front store categories and we are expanding our emphasis on both through a combination of store remodelings merchandising enhancements and improved product mix among other front store initiatives shoppers have responded enthusiastically to our expanded healthy food options weve also continued to strengthen our position with hispanic customers the fastestgrowing demographic in the united states by launching cvs pharmacy y ms in  locations in miami these stores offer hundreds of hispanic products and services not found in traditional drugstores and we saw sales in the test stores increase by an average of  percent we expect to expand on this concept in the extracare loyalty program now in its th year continues to play an indispensable role in driving profitable front store sales across all our stores it helps identify our highervalue shoppers so we can build on our relationship with them through personalized promotions such shoppers represent  percent of our retail customer base but they are responsible for driving more than  percent of sales in the front of the store it has been more than a year since we stopped selling tobacco in our stores a move that better aligned our business practices with our goals as a health care company at the time we also reasoned that removing a convenient location to buy cigarettes could decrease overall tobacco use a new study conducted by our cvs health research institute has shown that approximately  million fewer packs were sold in states where cvs pharmacy has a  percent or greater share of the retail pharmacy market compared to states without a large cvs pharmacy presence we continue to promote smoking cessation in a variety of other ways with our  pharmacists and  nurse practitioners taking the lead the expansion of cvs minuteclinic continued in  with the number of locations at year end totaling  in  states and washington dc that includes the  clinics we acquired from target more than  percent of the us population now lives within  miles of a minuteclinic and we operate more retail clinics than all our competitors combined cvs minuteclinic plays an important complementary role with traditional medical practices through our  implementation of the epic electronic health record platform we are now sharing information with approximately  health systems and provider organizations the epic platform has also allowed us to expand the cvs minuteclinic scope of services to cover  of the  most common primary care diagnoses cvs minuteclinic has been exploring a number of transformative digital offerings such as telehealth to improve access and convenience this is just one of the many ways in which we have been working to enhance our digital capabilities across the enterprise to strengthen engagement with patients and providers for example weve added several features to the cvs pharmacy app that have improved the customer experience in the pharmacy as well as the front of the store benefits include improved adherence as well as savings of both time and money the aging population has created new growth opportunities and was a key driver of our omnicare acquisition the nations aging population will play a major role in the evolving health care market and it will create new opportunities for cvs health the number of people  or older is expected to grow  percent in just the next five yearsand  percent through  this demographic utilizes more than double the number of prescriptions of the under population creating a longterm tailwind for the industry increased utilization combined with growth in specialty medications is expected to fuel a  percent rise in prescription expenditures annually over the next decade with this projected growth in prescription expenditures its important to keep in mind that pharmacy care remains the most costeffective way of reducing overall health care costs getting and keeping patients on the necessary medications to manage chronic diseases can drive billions of dollars in costs out of the system compared with our peers we have more ways in which we can touch patients to help drive adherence and improve outcomesfrom our retail mail and specialty pharmacies to our minuteclinic locations and now through omnicare approximately  percent of people over age  are likely to require some form of longterm care service and support the omnicare acquisition bolsters our ability to serve this population across the continuum of senior care omnicares nationwide footprint includes a significant presence in both the assisted living and skilled nursing facility settings giving us broad reach and an ability to leverage clinical insights to improve care through our combined enterprise assets we will also bridge some of the historic gaps in omnicares offerings to better address the unmet needs of these highrisk populations for example omnicares robust offering for the skilled nursing facility market did not include a complete solution to address care coordination issues during a patients admittance or discharge with roughly  retail locations we can ensure the timeliness of medication adherence through firstfill and emergency prescriptions reducing the potential for costly hospital readmissions in addition weve launched an integrated discharge solution that will coordinate care and offer the cvs health suite of services to patients returning home we are developing integrated solutions for the assisted living independent living and home care markets as well before signing off i must note with pride the more than  million we contributed to our communities in  through the cvs health foundation cvs health charity classic corporate grants gifts inkind and employee giving that total also includes the more than  million raised for the american lung associations lung force as well as stand up to cancer through our two instore campaigns moreover our remarkable colleagues volunteered their time to a broad range of community outreach programs and donated nearly  million to the causes they care most about they also supported the cvs health employee relief fund that helps colleagues who have suffered significant hardship as a result of a natural disaster family death medical emergency or other unforeseen events in closing i am confident that our leadership across the pharmacy spectrum will help us continue to drive superior value for our health care partners and shareholders as we expand our core pharmacy business we will also broaden our reach into new health care channels and make investments to drive sustainable enterprise growth on behalf of our board of directors and our more than  colleagues who work hard each and every day to help people on their path to better health thank you for investing in cvs health,5.237,1.0
163,CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2016,health care continues to evolve rapidly in the united states despite the ongoing changes as well as uncertainty surrounding health care reform cvs health believes that the winners in our industry will be those who drive more affordable accessible and effective care we are uniquely positioned to meet any challenges head on and pivot as needed to address any policy changes we continue to have the most extensive suite of enterprise assets each of which would be a market leader on a standalone basis yet what really sets them apart is our ability largely through technology to integrate pharmacy care from the payor to the provider to the patient our success at integrating our assets enables us to offer innovative services and to deliver additional value to stakeholders products such as maintenance choice  and specialty connect  are unmatched in the marketplace they remain the gold standard in giving patients choice while also delivering substantial savings to payors moreover with our truly integrated assets we have a full view of each patient and a single patient record for prescriptions and care regardless of the cvs health channel used we think of our cvs pharmacy  locations as the front door of health care they give us a significant advantage in the marketplace as the retailization of health care continues with consumerdirected health plans putting more incentive into the hands of patients to make costeffective decisions regarding their health our research has found that facetoface interactions are two to three times more effective than other interactions at increasing adherence and improving health outcomes importantly cvs health also owns the last mile in the delivery of care our unmatched touch pointsfrom retail and mail to specialty medical clinics longterm care and infusionput us in direct contact with health care consumers every day this letter will provide additional insight into these topics as well as update you on our results across the enterprise we have many accomplishments to look back on including a successful pbm selling season superior specialty growth and the progress we made at integrating the  acquisitions of omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of target we also excelled at managing rising drug costsor trend as always ill start with a brief overview of cvs healths financial performance and outlookrobust cash flow provides a strong platform for future growth in  we benefited from our ongoing focus on the three key financial pillars that we consider essential to maximizing shareholder value  driving productive longterm growth  generating significant levels of free cash flow and  optimizing capital allocation net revenues for the year increased nearly  percent to a record  billion while adjusted earnings per share eps rose  percent to  the compound annual growth rate in operating profit and adjusted eps puts us at the high end of the steady state growth targets we introduced in  we experienced strong organic prescription growth across the enterprise in  augmented by the omnicare and target acquisitions moreover the successful cvs caremark  pbm selling season of  led to growth in our membership base and claims in  that said we do expect to experience some headwinds in the near term that will slow earnings growth in  driven primarily by pharmacy network changes announced late in  that are causing some retail prescriptions to migrate out of our pharmacies additionally our entire industry is facing uncertainty surrounding health care reform all of these factors contributed to a  percent decline in cvs healths stock price in  although we have still outperformed both the sp  index and the dow jones industrial average on a five and year basis we have already developed a fourpoint plan that will help us generate more robust levels of earnings growth in the years ahead first we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and cvs pharmacys compelling retail value proposition to partner more broadly with other pbms and health plans our recent announcement that optumrx members now have the option to fill their day prescriptions at a cvs pharmacy is just one example second we will continue to innovate to bring new integrated pbm products to market that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our integrated model take maintenance choice which gives plan members the option of receiving their day prescriptions in the mail or through instore pickup its latest iteration now in the pilot phase brings convenience to the next level by offering sameday delivery within two to three hours to a members home or workplace third we have launched an enterprise streamlining initiative that we expect to result in nearly  billion in cumulative savings by  it includes enhancing the efficiency of our shared services functions optimizing our pharmacy delivery platform and rationalizing our store footprint as part of the latter we expect to close approximately  stores in  many are located close to our cvs pharmacy locations within target stores finally we have significant cash generation capabilities that provide us with a variety of ways to grow and return value to shareholders free cash flow totaled  billion in  and we returned  billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the year after increasing our quarterly dividend by  percent for  our board of directors has approved an additional  percent increase for  that marks our th consecutive year of increasing the dividend we will also continue to repurchase shares taking advantage of the recent decline in our stock price through dividends and share repurchases we expect to allocate more than  billion in  to enhancing total returns for shareholders as exemplified by omnicare and target we also use our cash flow for strategic acquisitions and other ventures that supplement our existing asset base and provide a platform for longterm growth we will continue to identify such opportunities in the future always taking a disciplined approach to deploying capital with wellladdered debt maturities and a high tripleb credit rating we have a healthy balance sheet that provides flexibility and allows us to maximize shareholder value for the long term in fact we took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment in  to reduce longterm debt levels and the associated interest expense pbms are a key part of the solution to reining in rising drug prices before discussing cvs caremarks performance i want to address the ongoing rhetoric around drug pricing new launches at elevated price points and increasing prices of older drugs have contributed to a sense that government interventions are necessary some market participants have attempted to paint pbms as middle men in the pharmacy supply chain taking outsized profits at the expense of patients and payors this is simply not true pbms are the solution not the problem thats why both public and private payors continue to count on pbms as indispensable partners that help to manage their drug trend numerous evaluations from the federal trade commission congressional budget office and other government agencies have consistently concluded that pbms operate in a highly efficient market and drive real savings to the health care economy and cvs caremarks array of cost management solutions have helped to reduce client costs from an unmanaged gross trend of  percent to a managed trend of only  percent in  in addition a recent industry study showed that every dollar invested in pbm services returned  in savings for clients and members so the value of pbms is quantitatively pretty clear now it is a bigger challenge to negotiate lower prices when there is basically a single product in a category so we will continue to encourage the need to create competition within therapeutic classes as a solution to reducing the cost of drugs whether its clearing out the fda backlog of potential drug approvals many of which are generics or increasing the speed to market of new biosimilar agents high satisfaction rates integrated offerings and trend management capabilities are driving growth in cvs caremarks book of business cvs caremarks integrated model continued to resonate in the marketplace helping us achieve strong top and bottomline growth in  in a highly competitive  selling season gross new business wins totaled  billion that represents more than half of all revenue from clients that switched pbms health plans accounted for approximately twothirds of our wins with employers unions and government entities comprising the restwith our  percent retention rate net new business for  totaled  billion this new business provides an important platform to grow dispensing across the enterprise as an example lets look at payors that came on board in  while their members filled  million retail prescriptions in one of our channels before these payors were clients we expect their members to fill more than  million scripts through one of our channels in  that will be an important driver of share gains payors have different reasons for choosing cvs caremark from our high client and member satisfaction scores to our ability to control trend we accomplish the latter in a variety of ways among them cvs health has been the industry

164,CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2017,health care costs in the united states are rising at a remarkable pace driven in large part by an aging population and the increased prevalence of chronic disease to address todays challenges and play a larger role in the evolution of health care cvs health has assembled a unique suite of assets that allows us to deliver superior outcomes at a lower cost beyond their formidable standalone capabilities weve integrated these assets to fill unmet needs and create opportunities to redefine health care for all our stakeholders our planned acquisition of aetna one of the nations leading diversified health care benefits companies represents another leg of this journey through our unmatched patient touchpoints cvs health already owns the front door of our customers health care experience our combined companies will help to remake this experience integrating more closely the work of doctors pharmacists other health care professionals and health benefits companies the deal is still going through regulatory approvals and we currently anticipate it closing during the second half of  revenue continued to rise in  with progress made on plan for sustainable earnings growth before going into more detail on our accomplishments and challenges ill first provide a brief overview of the past years financial performance net revenue for the year increased by  percent to a record  billion with adjusted earnings per share up slightly at  im happy to report that we have also made meaningful gains in the fourpoint plan we laid out in  to generate more robust levels of earnings growth in the years ahead let me highlight some key steps in the progress we have made first cvs pharmacy has partnered more broadly with pharmacy benefits managers pbms and health plans our network arrangements with cigna optumrx and express scripts as well as expanded medicare part d preferred network arrangements should drive meaningful growth in cvs pharmacy prescription volumes on the innovation front we continued to introduce pbm productssuch as transform diabetes carethat lower client costs while improving care for members we also unveiled a new performancebased pharmacy network that is anchored by cvs pharmacy walgreens and up to  independent pharmacies the network is designed not only to deliver unit cost savings but also to improve clinical outcomes that will help lower overall health care costs and through realtime benefits we are putting memberspecific formulary information at the prescribers fingertips this allows doctors to select clinically appropriate alternatives that may also cost members less third we finished the first year of our enterprise streamlining initiative and are on track to generate cumulative savings of  billion by  among our accomplishments we have simplified the dispensing process by sharing workload across our mail retail and longterm care pharmacy platforms we are also implementing processes to simplify claims adjudication enrollment benefit verification and related client services finally we used our cash flow to return  billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in  due to the pending aetna acquisition we suspended our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of  and plan to maintain our current annual dividend of  per share in  differentiated pbm offerings drive customer satisfaction and new business wins our pbm cvs caremark delivered solid growth in  with increases in both revenue and operating profit since  we have achieved a  percent compound annual growth rate cagr for pbm revenue with a  percent cagr for operating profit turning to  we estimate that pbm net revenues will climb to approximately  billion while operating profit for the segment will approach  billion innovative offerings led to another outstanding selling season with gross new business wins totaling  billion for  that figure represents nearly half of all the business that switched pbms in the latest selling season with government and union clients accounting for the largest share of new business despite the fact that fewer health plans moved to a new pbm this segment still added nearly  billion in revenue along with these gains our pbm recorded a retention rate surpassing  percent that is due in no small part to a continued rise in client satisfaction among the  million lives we serve moreover our ability to retain clients has resulted in significant gains in enterprise dispensing over time we have developed new plan designs that save our clients money while simultaneously moving share into our channels for example the new plan members we enrolled over the past three selling seasons will contribute an additional  million prescriptions to the enterprise in  with brand inflation an aging population and the rising utilization of specialty drugs clients depend on us more than ever to slow the rate of drug spending growthor trend in  we succeeded in reducing trend for commercial clients from  percent in  to  percent the lowest level in five years we accomplished this through a variety of increasingly sophisticated costmanagement strategies such as our advanced approach to formularies and new or enhanced pharmacy networks among other innovations we are enhancing our flagship maintenance choice product by making it available to a broader range of clients including fully insured health plans by giving their members the option of getting day prescriptions at our stores or by mail we expect to save them money and improve adherence rates additionally weve enhanced member benefits with the launch of ondemand home delivery as well as the rollout of a digital tool that makes it easier to transfer a prescription into our network medicare and medicaid remain important growth drivers both for cvs health and our payor clients our silverscript insurance company subsidiary the nations largest standalone medicare part d prescription drug plan continued to perform well in the marketplace we have built deep expertise in medicare quality and delivery through our support of  million members for the third consecutive year silverscript earned four stars out of a maximum of five on the governments annual quality measurement systemwhen you include our health plan clients we support more than  million medicare members our

margin resulting in greater scale and stronger purchasing economics pbm clients value the breadth and depth of our specialty management innovations which include accordant nurse case management services coram infusion services and our novologix medical benefit management system a key differentiator novologix has helped us win  percent of the standalone specialty contracts that have changed hands over the past three years it currently has  million lives under managementspread across  health plansdelivering an estimated savings of  billion to our clients despite moderating brand drug inflation the rising significance of specialty generics and biosimilars and other dynamics that are expected to slow specialty growth specialty will remain the pharmacy industrys fastestgrowing segment specialtys clinical administrative and logistical complexities create opportunities for us to differentiate on price product and services looking at  we expect to continue outpacing the marketplace by adding another  billion in specialty revenue innovation will play a key role in our specialty growth and we have focused on applying it across three areas driving optimal adherence streamlining the prescribing process and managing highcost disease states for example our predictive analytics pilot is helping us understand why any given individual is nonadherent allowing us to adjust the timing of our interventions and the methodologies we use to close gaps in care our specialty connect solution which allows for pickup or dropoff of specialty prescriptions at our retail locations was among our first and most successful efforts at simplifying the specialty patient experience the ability to integrate with electronic health record systems is now helping us streamline the oftenchallenging prior authorization process so that physicians get their patients started on specialty therapies more rapidly cvs pharmacy remains focused on making pharmacy and everyday health care better for consumers flat same store prescription volumes along with reimbursement pressure and generic introductions led to a  percent decline in same store sales in  on the plus side prescriptions grew in our target pharmacies thanks to the strength of our patient care programs and maintenance choice cvs pharmacy locations fill  billion prescriptions annually and our share of us retail prescriptions exceeds  percent cvs caremark members have certainly helped us capture market share but we have also strengthened our relationships with other pbms and payors for example optumrx has made us the exclusive provider of day instore prescriptions for one of its networks and we are also a preferred pharmacy in the express scripts diabetes network in  we expect to see same store prescription volumes rise by at least  percent driven primarily by these broader partnerships with pbms and health plans as well as our expanded participation as a preferred pharmacy in a greater number of medicare part d networks we anticipate same store sales growth in the range of  percent to  percentwe remain focused on making pharmacy and everyday health care better for consumers and we have the physical and digital assets that customers demand our  retail locations make ours the largest us pharmacy chain with nearly  percent of the population living within three miles of a store in  our  retail pharmacists provided more than  million facetoface consultations with customers to discuss dosages timing and side effects we have also expanded delivery options with nationwide nextday delivery and sameday delivery in select cities because approximately  percent of people do not continue prescriptions as prescribed we have built the industrys leading patient care platform this includes new script pickup counseling adherence outreach calls gaps in care counseling prescription care counseling and where appropriate helping customers move from  to day prescriptions were adding valuable services at retail and investing in the frontstore shopping experience beyond pharmacy we are adding new services to our stores with the goal of enhancing our position as the front door to consumer health we already operate more than  minuteclinic locations in  states and are expanding its offerings to include monitoring and treatment of diabetes hypertension high cholesterol and thyroid disorders we will also begin rolling out audiology and optical centers in select locations in  following successful pilots both offer significantly greater productivity per square foot than comparable areas of our average stores in the front of the store we are driving growth by making investments that improve the shopping experience for example by the end of  we will have reset nearly  stores to our popular health and beauty format stores that we have already converted are showing an average of  percent gain in sales as well as improved profitability from their emphasis on these two highmargin categories among our other resets and refreshes we will convert an additional  locations to the cvs pharmacy y ms format to better serve the fastgrowing hispanic market we are able to identify optimal reset candidates in part through the many insights we have gained from extracare card users launched back in  extracare today has  million actively engaged customers it is supported by a broad range of technologies that help us target and engage highvalue shoppers with the right offersboth in the store and digitallyand adjust to changes in consumer behavior in  cardholders earned  billion in extracare rewards and savings cvs health has made addressing the opioid epidemic a cornerstone of our social responsibility initiatives you can read about some of our social responsibility and sustainability initiatives on pages  and  i do want to touch on just a couple here starting with our response to the opioid epidemic this has become one of the greatest public health threats facing our country and we owe it to our patients and communities to help provide solutions cvs health has been working with policymakers across the country to increase access to naloxone the medication that rapidly reverses opioid overdose in early  we also introduced an enhanced opioid utilization management program that limits the supply of opioids dispensed to seven days for certain acute prescriptions for patients who are new to therapy it also limits the daily dosage of opioids dispensed based on the strength of the opioid and requires the use of immediaterelease formulations of opioids before extendedrelease opioids are dispensed initial results of this program show that the number of patients new to opioid therapy with an acute condition who received more than a sevenday supply decreased by  percenti also want to acknowledge here the outstanding work of our colleagues who helped ensure that customers in florida texas and puerto rico received vital medications both before and after the hurricanes that devastated their communities in  cvs health colleagues played a critical role in supporting so many of our outreach initiatives we have proudly supported rebuilding efforts through a  million instore fundraising campaign along with the donation of more than  million worth of critical products and supplies for a comprehensive review of our efforts i

165,CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2018,todays health care system faces a broad range of challenges from its complexity and lack of support for patients to a focus on episodic care in a feeforservice environment moreover fragmentation among various stakeholders all too often leaves patients struggling to manage and coordinate their own care these factors have led to unnecessary avoidable spending and inferior outcomes for patients in fact research shows that up to  percent of the more than  trillion the united states spends annually on treating patients with chronic conditions is preventable i believe that cvs health is best positioned to tackle these challenges and remake the consumer health care experience through our cvs pharmacy locations and unique suite of integrated assets we can open a new front door to health care that is both easier to use and less expensive what are some of these assets they include our cvs caremark pharmacy benefits business minuteclinic coram infusion services accordant nurse care management and of course our transformative acquisition of aetna completed in november  aetna acquisition creates multiple opportunities for medical cost savings and longterm growth one of the nations leading diversified health care benefits companies aetna broadens cvs healths reach and allows us to play a larger role in the health care system its focus on the consumer has long mirrored cvs healths aetna employees have built trusted relationships with  million members and created new digital tools and analytical capabilities to proactively engage consumers in their health at the same time the company has built solid relationships with highquality providers aetna forms the cornerstone of our new health care benefits segment which also incorporates our silverscript medicare part d business in  the nations largest standalone part d prescription drug plan is now part of one of the fastest growing medicare advantage providers in the country among new options for  we have introduced silverscript allure this enhanced plan offers reduced costs on many brand name drugs through the application of pointofsale rebates im pleased to report that we have a clear line of sight on more than  million of combined company synergies by the end of  and we have begun to execute on our plan to achieve that goal the majority of these synergies will be derived from the reduction of corporate expenses and the integration of our operations the integration of cvs healths and aetnas core capabilities represents a much larger longerterm opportunity we are already executing on several initiatives we believe will drive abovemarket growth in this rapidly changing health care environment among them we are expanding our medicare advantage business by adding membership in existing markets and through continued geographic expansion we see opportunities as well within medicaid building upon the success weve had with recent wins in kansas and florida and are also working to strengthen our commercial offerings at the community level we are creating differentiated products and services that will drive meaningful value for both consumers and payors for example cvs health can better manage five common chronic conditions through the tighter integration of pharmacy and medical benefits a rich clinical data set and our local assets we also expect to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions improve access to lowercost sites of care optimize primary care through minuteclinic and develop a series of comprehensive programs to better manage complex chronic diseases such as kidney care and oncology importantly we will make these solutions available to more than just aetnas members an open platform model will serve the needs of all payors and we expect to have these offerings in the market for the  selling season the expected medical cost savings will have a tremendous impact on cvs healths financial performance as well success at slowing the rise in medical costs translates into additional underwriting margin for our health plan customers and for aetna we plan to take a portion of those savings and reinvest them back into the business to improve our competitive positioning and ultimately increase membership by introducing new highermargin programs and services we will create a platform that customers want to use and that results in improved retention we continued to generate significant free cash flow and returned more than  billion to shareholders we clearly have reason to be confident in our operating models ability to drive profitable longterm growth and enhance shareholder value that said  was not free of challenges as we took  billion of goodwill impairment charges related to our longterm care business as a result gaap operating income for the year declined by  percent revenues for the year increased by  percent to a record  billion with gaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of  adjusted earnings per share was  an increase of  percent versus  these numbers include aetnas performance only since the close of the acquisition at the end of november cvs health continued to generate significant cash flow in  cash flow from operations totaled  billion with free cash flow reaching  billion we used part of our free cash flow to return  billion to shareholders based on a dividend of  per share we already announced in late  that due to the aetna acquisition we would suspend any dividend increases as well as our share repurchase program in the near term we plan to use our free cash flow to fund our dividend and pay down debt to get to our targeted leverage ratio multiple drivers spurred pbm revenue gains as clients embraced new costsaving options cvs caremark enjoyed a strong  with revenues rising  percent to  billion specialty pharmacy was also a key driver of pbm revenue in  with rising volumes stemming from net new business operating income for the segment rose to  billion gross new business wins from our  selling season totaled  billion resulting in  billion in net new business client satisfaction was evident in our  percent retention rate current and new clients have responded enthusiastically to our guaranteed net cost model a new approach to pricing pbm services that we announced in december we have also seen rapid adoption of the realtime benefits solution that we introduced in late  meanwhile our maintenance choice offerings continue to attract new customers maintenance choice gives plan members the choice of obtaining their day maintenance medications by mail or at any cvs retail pharmacy with no increase in copay or payor pricing at the end of  we had nearly  million lives enrolled instore prescription volumes continued to rise while we also introduced new concept stores and pilot programs despite reimbursement pressures revenues rose by  percent to  billion in our retailltc segment that result was due primarily to a  percent increase in same store prescription volumes on a day equivalent basis the continued adoption of our patient care programs alliances with pbms and health plans our inclusion in a number of additional part d networks this year and brand drug price inflation cvs pharmacys share of us retail prescriptions now exceeds  percent our retail pharmacies are foundational to our community health strategy and one of the keys in our efforts to simplify the patient journey to that end we are opening a series of healthhub concept stores that will be a testing ground for a new retail engagement model that brings health care services to consumers in a more convenient more accessible and more customerfocused manner as we pilot new programs and service offerings we will identify the solutions that are
