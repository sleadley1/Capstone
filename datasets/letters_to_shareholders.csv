Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,1999,"This is our first letter to shareholders, including everyone at Goldman Sachs who owns shares in the firm. Sharing ownership throughout the firm was one of our principal reasons for becoming a public company, and creating thousands of new owners has enhanced our culture and bound us more closely together. We are stewards of our own investments and yours. In our first year as a public company, Goldman Sachs reported record financial results. On a pro forma basis,1 the firm earned $2.6 billion in net earnings in 1999, or $5.27 per diluted share, versus $1.3 billion, or $2.62 per diluted share, in 1998. These results came from strong performances across all the firm’s businesses. In 1999, we ranked first in worldwide mergers and acquisitions (M&A), advising on more than $1.3 trillion in announced merger transactions. We were also first in equity offerings worldwide, and third in global high- yield offerings, gaining momentum from a fourth-place high-yield ranking in 1998. And we enjoyed very strong performances in our trading and other businesses. Our performance far exceeded the financial goals we set for ourselves in the lead-up to our initial public offering (IPO). We told potential investors that we saw numerous opportunities to grow the firm’s businesses, but emphasized that we work in an industry that does not produce predictable earnings on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Recognizing this reality, we set financial targets of an annual return on equity of more than 20 percent and 12 to 15 percent earnings growth over the cycle. In 1999, on a pro forma basis, we had a 31 percent return on equity, and our net earnings rose by more than 100 percent.We cannot, of course, predict a repeat of this performance in 2000, but we see favorable conditions for Goldman Sachs and our industry. Global economic growth should continue, driven by a remarkably resilient U.S. economy. Europe is one of the fastest growing investment banking markets, led by continued consolidation, restructuring, pension reform and the effects of the euro on financing markets. Asia is recovering, with the return of Asian companies to equity and debt markets creating further opportunities. Latin America is also recovering, and we are pursuing more opportunities in the region. We also see great potential to manage more private wealth around the world, an area where our strong brand and franchise give us a competitive advantage. And we have never seen more opportunities to put our market knowledge and global franchise to work by investing our capital alongside our clients in businesses ranging from Internet start-ups to real estate. Given our industry’s accelerating growth and complexity, we have chosen to focus on areas where we have distinctive skills or competitive advantages. We are emphasizing three areas: growing our core businesses around the globe, becoming the world’s best technology investment bank and continuing to recruit the most talented people. This year’s record performance results from efforts to build our core businesses around the world: our Global Capital Markets businesses (Investment Banking, and Trading and Principal Investments) and our Asset Management and Securities Services business. Our success has come from steadily building these businesses to sufficient scale and flexibility to serve the complex needs of our clients in today’s borderless economy. In the process, we have become a truly global bank — one that thrives in every major market. The outlook for our core businesses is bright. Our investment banking strengths — telecommunications, media and entertainment, high technology, healthcare, financial services, and energy and power — are all industries that are growing rapidly and consolidating around the world. We also have a strong and growing trading and market-making franchise. Our willingness and ability to take risk in often difficult and volatile markets distinguishes us from competitors and enhances our relationships with clients. We also enjoy great success and profitability in expanding our private equity business, in which we co-invest with clients in a diverse set of asset classes around the world. And we continue to build — through steady, organic growth — what is now a combined asset management and private wealth management business with nearly $500 billion in assets under supervision. Our aim is to become the world’s premier technology investment bank, with technology embedded in everything we do. We cannot serve our most forward-looking, technology-driven clients unless we are a great technology firm in our own right. We are the leading advisor to high-tech companies in the areas of M&A and IPOs. Goldman Sachs lead managed 47 high-tech offerings in 1999 that generated more than $150 billion in market capitalization, giving us an industry-leading 22 percent market share. This includes IPOs for Webvan, Terra Networks, Juniper Networks and Red Hat. These transactions follow IPOs in previous years for eBay, Yahoo!, Inktomi, Exodus and other leading Internet companies. We also advised on high-tech mergers totaling $145 billion during 1999, giving us the top market position in this area. We complemented this underwriting and M&A flow with the outstanding research coverage, trading and market making that our clients expect from us. Our strong relationships with high-tech clients, and our expertise in this sector, have helped us become a significant investor in high- tech companies. In recent years, we have invested $750 million of our own and our clients’ capital in more than 70 technology companies. We are also focusing intensively on how technology can best be used within Goldman Sachs to change the way we work and serve our clients. We are doing this by drawing on our in-house experts who advise clients, what we learn from the best-of-class technology firms, and our own experience as high-tech investors. We are placing particular emphasis on innovative technologies that serve clients, including e-commerce ventures, as well as using technology to achieve operating efficiencies. The goal is to have technology that matches — and helps us manage — the web of relationships we have around the world and our knowledge of markets. Our emphasis on technology helps explain why our first acquisition as a public company was The Hull Group, a leading options-trading and electronic market-making firm. Hull uses technology to auto- mate trades and quickly produce a two-way price, working in nine countries and 28 exchanges around the world. Hull complements our existing businesses, expands our trading capabilities and gives us a leading position in electronic markets. We are also looking at how our clients and the markets are affected by new technologies, particularly electronic trading. This has led to our call for a fundamental restructuring of traditional equities exchanges, including establishing an electronically driven, central market in the United States. We are also focusing on electronic trading of fixed income securities, and our investments in BrokerTec, TradeWeb, BondDesk and Bond.Hub will help to centralize liquidity and expand our sales and trading franchise across markets. Our people have driven Goldman Sachs’ success for 130 years through sustained, superb execution across a range of markets and products. The best way to maintain that advantage is by recruiting, training and mentoring people as we always have — one at a time, with great care. We want Goldman Sachs to be a magnet for the very best people in the world — from new graduates to senior hires. At the same time, we are focusing on developing our very deep bench of talented people and improving and extending their skills. We are, for instance, placing young leaders in demanding positions that stretch their abilities. We are also devoting more time and attention to the formal training and development of leaders, particularly senior leaders. As we begin the new century, we know that our success will depend on how well we respond to change and manage the firm’s rapid growth. That requires a willingness to abandon old practices and discover new and innovative ways of conducting business. Everything is subject to change — everything but the values we live by and stand for: teamwork, putting clients’ interests first, integrity, entrepreneurship and excellence. These values sustained the firm and set us apart during the 20th century. They must never change, but much else will. We can afford nothing less if we are to become a nimble, highly focused, technology-centered, 21st century business and remain the world’s premier investment bank and securities firm. We thank our shareholders for choosing to invest in Goldman Sachs, our clients for choosing to work with us, and our people for leading the firm’s record performance this year."
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2000,"2000 was a remarkable year for Goldman Sachs and a rewarding one for our shareholders. In our first full year as a public company, we posted record earnings(1) of $3.25 billion, up 27% from $2.55 billion in 1999. Earnings per diluted share rose to $6.35, a 20% increase from $5.27 in 1999. And our return on equity reached 27%. These results reflect more than a very good year for a number of our businesses. They are also evidence of our continued progress toward our goal of becoming the preeminent, global investment banking and securities firm. This goal is underpinned by a strategy that emphasizes expanding in key markets our core businesses: Global Capital Markets (Investment Banking and Trading and Principal Investments) and Asset Management and Securities Services. Our goal is for Goldman Sachs to be the financial advisor of choice for the most important and influential corporations, institutions and individuals worldwide. It is critical that we capture — and keep — a leading share of the high valueadded business of these clients. In 2000, we experienced marked success in doing so. In Investment Banking, for instance, we were the number one advisor in merger transactions on a worldwide basis. Goldman Sachs advised on a total of $1.3 trillion in announced transactions, including seven out of ten of the largest in the world. We hold strong leadership positions in key growth industries, including telecommunications, financial institutions, technology, healthcare and energy. Goldman Sachs was also the number one global underwriter of initial public offerings (IPOs) and all common stock offerings. In addition, we improved our high-yield underwriting business, finishing the year with the number two market share in the United States. In 2000, we also continued to expand our most profitable trading businesses. We placed a special emphasis on client-driven transactions and solving complex problems with highly tailored solutions. During the course of the year, we succeeded in increasing our trading revenues while lowering risk. In Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC),net revenues grew by 5% despite difficult market conditions. Our Equities business posted spectacular gains, with net revenues up 78% over 1999. In October, we strengthened our capabilities in the equity market through our combination with Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, an industry leader in securities market making and clearing. In Principal Investments, we substantially expanded our global platform, raising $8 billion in new private equity and real estate funds. Goldman Sachs now manages more than $30 billion of merchant banking investments for our clients and our own account. Asset Management and Securities Services also generated strong growth in 2000. Net revenues rose 43% from 1999 and assets under management reached $294 billion, a 14% increase over the previous year. Since 1995, our assets under management have expanded at an average rate of 41% per year, making us one of the fastest growing large asset managers in the industry. In 2000, we added $40 billion of new client assets, building on $34 billion and $46 billion increases in 1999 and 1998, respectively. This growth is testimony to both our investment record and distribution power. We see attractive growth opportunities in the high-net-worth market and are investing to capture an increasing share of it. A strong capital position is an important part of our strategy. Indeed, one of the principal reasons we became a public company was to secure the permanent capital necessary to serve our clients better. Since our IPO, our equity capital has grown from $6.6 billion to $16.5 billion. Despite this increase, we remain as disciplined about our capital as we were when we were a private partnership. Our capital is available to help clients meet their important needs but we use it carefully for those transactions where we can combine it with our expertise and where we believe that the potential rewards justify the risk. We owe our shareholders no less. We continue to compete with firms with more capital than Goldman Sachs. And, in 2000, we continued to compete successfully. The reason is simple: Our clients choose us not just because of our balance sheet but because of even more important assets — our reputation for excellence and our people who provide the very best advice and execution. Our distinctive culture — which emphasizes integrity, entrepreneurship, excellence, teamwork and fairness — has allowed us to assemble the most talented team in the business. Our IPO further strengthened our culture by giving all our employees a stake in the firm’s future. Today, the people of Goldman Sachs own more than 55% of the firm, making us one of the largest employee-owned companies in the world and the employer of choice in our industry. It is critical that Goldman Sachs continue to be a magnet for talent at both senior and entry levels. This is why attracting, retaining and rewarding the very best individuals was one of our highest priorities in 2000. As part of this effort, in November we expanded our senior leadership by selecting 114 new participating managing directors and naming 198 new managing directors. These individuals — the most diverse group of senior leaders we have ever chosen — combine tested professional excellence with a strong personal commitment to our core values. We are proud of our accomplishments in 2000. Our scope was truly global, with European and Asian operations representing more than 35% of our workforce and more than 40% of our net revenues. In key businesses — advisory services, underwriting and trading — we are leaders in every important market in the world. And our asset management business, already strong, is poised for even more global growth in the future. In 2000, we were fortunate to exceed again our financial goals of a return on equity of more than 20% and earnings growth in the 12-15% range. These remain our objectives. But, looking forward, we do not expect a predictable, stable pattern of quarter-over-quarter earnings increases. Goldman Sachs will continue to seek faster growth in our investment banking and asset management businesses to ensure greater stability in our earnings. But fluctuating market conditions mean that the securities industry can never attain the stability of some other businesses.The markets of the last months of 2000 and the first part of 2001 produced a much less favorable business environment than earlier in 2000, reminding us that our greatest challenge remains managing growth. We will be disciplined in our approach, but we will continue to build for the future. In our business, periods of slowing and volatility are to be expected, but they do not change our enthusiasm about the medium to long term. And, in the short term, they provide us with an opportunity to strengthen our competitive position. The untimely death of Michael Mortara in November was a loss to the firm and to all of us who had the privilege of working with him. Mike played an instrumental role in the creation of the mortgage-backed securities market in the 1980s. As co-head of our FICC Division from 1994 to 2000 and, from May 2000, president and CEO of GS Ventures, the firm’s financial services incubator, Mike was one of the most respected and beloved members of the Goldman Sachs family. Looking ahead, the changes sweeping today’s economy — globalization, deregulation, consolidation, technological transformation and pension reform — are creating a business environment of great opportunities. By virtue of the firm’s global presence, unparalleled reputation and extraordinary people, Goldman Sachs is well positioned to seize those opportunities on behalf of our shareholders. We are absolutely committed to doing so in 2001 and beyond."
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2001,"It is impossible to discuss 2001 without beginning with the events of September 11. While our 13,000 people in the downtown New York area were unharmed and our facilities largely untouched, the stunning and savage attack on the World Trade Center, just a few blocks away from our headquarters, represented a formidable challenge in operational and human terms. We are proud to report that the people of Goldman Sachs, not just in New York but around the world, met this challenge with courage, resilience and initiative. But even as our people worked tirelessly to keep Goldman Sachs up and running, they never forgot the human dimension of the September 11 tragedy. They reached out to provide comfort to those who had lost loved ones and friends in the attack. And together with the firm, they provided needed material assistance in the form of more than $11 million in donations for the victims of this crime. In short, September 11 tested us as a firm and as individuals in a way we had never been tested. And we emerged stronger than ever before. Our corporate culture had again proven its enduring value. This year’s report focuses on the Business Principles and the core values that embody our culture: commitment to the client, teamwork, integrity, professional excellence and entrepreneurial spirit. These values not only serve our clients and shareholders; they also set us apart from other firms, making us the employer of choice in our industry. Our culture of teamwork allows us to pull together the best thinking from different parts of the firm and deliver integrated solutions to complex client problems. Our emphasis on integrity makes us a firm that individuals, corporations, institutions and governments can trust. Our commitment to professional excellence and a true meritocracy ensures that our clients receive the very best service that our industry can offer. Our focus on entrepreneurship means that we are always searching for new ways to promote our customers’ interests. Maintaining the Goldman Sachs culture is therefore a critical task. But it is not easy. Like any competitive edge, our cul- ture must be continually reinforced and adapted or it will atrophy. Though some were concerned that our decision to go public in 1999 would undermine our core values, we disagreed. We believe that our culture reflects much more than our ownership structure. Instead, it is the manifestation of the values that have been impressed upon us for years—constantly communicated from the top down—and the behavior and actions that are reinforced through our 360-degree performance reviews and rewarded through promotions, compensation and peer approval. Our initial public offering, in fact, enhanced our culture by spreading ownership—and a personal stake in our success—throughout the firm. But our culture does face a challenge: our grow- ing size. It is far easier to inculcate and perpetuate core values in an organization of 5,000 people than it is in one of over 22,000. The major task confronting us today—as it did in 1999 and will for the foreseeable future—is managing growth. In the financial services industry, where people are absolutely critical, size can become the enemy of excellence. It is our job to make sure that this does not happen at Goldman Sachs, where our culture is a magnet for talent. This is because we offer outstanding people—high achievers—the opportunity to work with other outstand- ing people as part of a mutually support- ive team in a collaborative environment. Our people are motivated by job content, which has never been more interesting, and by working in a meritocracy where they are tested with great responsibility. They demand career development oppor- tunities and care deeply about the values that Goldman Sachs represents. Our people want to make a difference. They see globalization as a force for good and are proud of the dynamic role that Goldman Sachs plays in shaping the world economy. It is no easy task to maintain our culture in the face of great growth and change. To meet this challenge, in 1999 we initiated a multiyear process to adapt our culture to a large and growing global organization without becoming bureaucratic. As we became larger, we recognized that many of our processes—recruiting, mentoring, training, performance evaluation, career development—had to be reengineered. In the “old days,” each business manager was his or her own Human Resources professional, and much of the training and career development was done on an apprenticeship basis. This doesn’t work quite as well anymore. Over the last several years, we have made somereal progress in adapting our people- management capabilities to a larger organization in “Pine Street” (named after the address of the original Goldman Sachs headquarters). We are 12 months into a highly promising leadership development program for our Managing Directors, headed by the former Director of the G.E. Crotonville Executive Educational Program. We are doing a better job of continually communicating with our people on firmwide, divisional and business-unit levels. We have continued to strengthen our perfor- mance evaluations, mentoring and training programs throughout the firm. We have recently taken actions to intensify and strengthen a 21st century Diversity Program in the context of a global institution. We continue to expand our Community TeamWorks Program. This year, over 18,000 of our people around the world worked together in teams to give energy and creativity to nonprofit organizations in the communities in which they work. These and other measures to manage our growth are ongoing. They are clearly only part of what must be a long-term, broad- based commitment to strengthening our culture. Making—and keeping—that commitment will be critical as we work toward our goal of becoming the world’s preeminent investment banking, securities and investment management company. Of course, we recognize that a corporate culture is not an end in itself but a means to an end. It enables us to execute suc- cessfully a winning business strategy that results in extraordinary client service and superior long-term financial performance for our shareholders. Like everyone in our industry, we faced considerable adversity in the form of difficult market conditions in 2001. We have noted in the past that we do not expect a predictable, stable pattern of quarter-over-quarter earnings increases. In fact, while we believe our business offers attractive long- term returns, 2001 provided an excellent reminder that fluctuating markets mean that our business will never have the stability of some other sectors. We continually tell our people that although we cannot do anything to change the environment, we can strive to outperform the competition and meet the high expectations of our clients. From that perspective, 2001 was a highly successful year. The quality of our people and culture, together with the strength and diversity of our businesses, was evident as we produced an 18% return on our tangible shareholders’ equity in one of the most challenging years in our industry’s history.Investment Banking activity and revenues declined sharply for the industry. Our own results were no exception. The firm’s performance in this challenging environ- ment was, however, first-rate. We believe the quality of our client relationships and our leadership in the most important businesses have never been stronger. For example, in 2001, we again were the number one advisor in merger transac- tions on a worldwide basis. We advised on 8 of the 10 largest transactions com- pleted during the year, more than any other firm. We also were the number one global underwriter of initial public offerings and all common stock offerings. We think these results are a testament to the strength and quality of our franchise. Within our Trading and Principal Investments business, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities produced excellent results, increasing net revenues 35% by capitalizing on lower interest rates, increased volatility and strong cus- tomer demand. Performance was strong across a wide range of our businesses, including commodities, currencies, our credit-sensitive businesses and fixed income derivatives. Net revenues declined in our equities business in a difficult environment with declining volatility and customer flow. Despite the challenging market, we were very pleased with our progress in the integration of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg with our own capabilities to strengthen our leading position in equities markets. Principal Investments had a very disap- pointing year, with significant mark- to-market losses, principally in our high technology and telecommunications investments. Overall, however, we con- tinue to believe that our merchant bank- ing activities are an excellent business for us. We see many attractive opportunities created by the volatility in the past year. Asset Management and Securities Services produced another record year in 2001. Assets under management increased 19% to $351 billion. In 2001, we had record net inflows of $67 billion of new client assets. These very strong results demonstrate the value created through a diverse, multi-product global platform. We also continue to build our high-net-worth business and believe it is one of our most attractive growth opportunities. As our industry has undergone dramatic consolidation over the last few years, and as commercial banks have increas- ingly used low-priced credit as a competi- tive tool, some observers have asked, “Is Goldman Sachs big enough?” To be frank, we believe that this is the wrong question, particularly for a global firm with over 22,000 people, $18 billion in equity capital, and a $300 billion balance sheet. Capital has never been a limiting factor for us. The right question — and the one we ask ourselves constantly — is, “Can we con- tinue to manage growth by adapting our culture to a large and increasingly com- plex global company?” This, and not the size of competitors, will be the key to our continuing ability to execute our strategy superbly, which is the ultimate determi- nant of our success. We face a big challenge, but we are up to it. We wouldn’t trade places with any of our competitors, whatever their size or business model. Despite the uncertainties of the current market envi- ronment, we remain bullish about the future. We operate at the “sweet spot” of global capitalism. We believe that the trends that have created opportunities for us in the past— globalization, deregulation, consolidation and market-driven reform—will continue to do so in the future. But we know that our ultimate success will depend upon a constant commitment to the core cultural values that allow us to execute success- fully our corporate strategy and to attract the very best of the best in the world of finance. We have made that commitment and intend to adhere resolutely to it in 2002 and the years that follow. We owe you, our shareholders, no less."
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2002,"It was a challenging year for Goldman Sachs. The business environment was perhaps the most difficult in recent history, marked by weak or negative growth throughout much of the world, international uncertainty, the third consecutive year of broad equities market declines and the continued aftermath of the technology/telecommunications bubble collapse. As a firm, we cannot control the external forces that shape the business climate. What we can control is how we manage our business and execute our strategy. On those terms, Goldman Sachs’ 2002 results demonstrated the firm’s resilience and ability to produce a solid perform- ance for shareholders. Net earnings for the year were $2.11 billion, on total net revenues of $13.99 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $4.03, down 5% from 2001. Return on shareholders’ equity was 11% for the year, and return on tangible shareholders’ equity was 15%. Evident in this performance were both the strength and diversity of the Goldman Sachs franchise and our discipline concerning expense reduction. This performance also reflected, as it has throughout the 133 years since the firm’s founding, in good times and bad, the quality of the people of Goldman Sachs and their ability to develop and execute business. Investment banking activity and net revenues for the industry declined throughout the year. Those declines are clearly seen in our investment banking results, although relative performance remained strong. Once again, Goldman Sachs ranked first in announced and completed global mergers and acquisitions, and we advised on seven of the ten largest deals completed during 2002.(1) We were also the leading underwriter of global public equity offerings in 2002, and ranked second in global initial public offerings.(1) Within our Trading and Principal Investments business, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) produced record net revenues for the firm, demonstrating the ability to serve clients and take risk prudently. In particular, we were able to avoid significant credit losses as the business environment deteriorated and spreads widened. Performance was strong across most of our FICC businesses, particularly in currencies, mortgages and fixed income derivatives. Net revenues declined in our Equities trading business, reflecting weaknesses in global equities markets in what continues to be a very difficult environment. At the same time, however, we continued to strengthen our equities franchise in the most important trading centers across the globe. And, as a result of the fuller integration of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, we are truly at the cutting edge of technology-driven innovation and efficiency. Principal Investments had another disappointing year, with further declines in the value of several technology and telecom investments more than offsetting favorable results from the real estate portfolio. During the year, however, we were successful at finding a number of very attractive investments in which to participate, and we continue to believe this is a particularly good time to be an active investor. Asset Management and Securities Services continued its strong performance in 2002. Despite significant equities market depreciation, assets under management declined only slightly, reflect- ing net inflows. This is, we believe, an affirmation of our investment track record as well as our focus on client service.In response to the difficult operating environment, we reduced operating expenses by 11% from the prior year’s level. Non-compensation expenses were pared back and we made painful but necessary reductions to our workforce, taking great care not to impair our ability to compete today or in the future. Compensation is, of course, our largest expense and we imposed rigorous discipline in making 2002 bonus awards. Most professionals saw reductions in total compensation, starting with the firm’s senior management. Finally, we took important steps throughout 2002 to refocus the entire Goldman Sachs organization on our business principles, which begin and end with an absolute insistence on integrity. In particular, we have a major continuing initiative aimed toward insuring that we exhibit unimpeachable professionalism in everything we do and reinforcing our culture. That culture, with its emphasis on client service, teamwork, strict compliance and excellence, is our greatest strength, but it requires constant reinforcement, particularly in difficult markets and under adverse conditions. Safeguarding our culture will continue to be one of our highest priorities in 2003. The continuing after-effects of the late 1990s technology/telecommunications bubble posed significant challenges to the financial markets and our industry in 2002. The huge losses associated with the bubble’s collapse severely affected investor confidence—which in turn was further shaken by the large and highly visible corporate scandals that emerged beginning in late 2001. All this led to a storm of public criticism and calls for new laws and regulations. Notwithstanding some of the rhetoric, much of the criticism has been warranted, as are many of the regulations recently enacted or proposed. And while it is simply wrong to say that investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, created the market bubble, it is true that, in common with much of the media, academia and the business community, we misjudged it. The more important point, at least for us at Goldman Sachs, is that we understand and accept our responsibilities as one of the gatekeepers of the financial markets. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that we all could have done better. We are committed to learning from our mistakes. Against this backdrop, in 2002 there were dramatic changes in the legal and regulatory environment. The New York Stock Exchange proposed new corporate governance listing rules. U.S. regulators mandated CEO and CFO certification of corporate financial statements. Law enforcement agencies began aggressive enforcement actions aimed at misconduct. And the U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in an attempt to strengthen confidence in U.S. corporations, accounting and financial markets. In the financial services industry, public scrutiny focused on the role and quality of investment research. Even before the public controversy of 2002 arose, we had taken a series of decisive steps, commencing in February, to protect further the integrity of our research and to improve its quality. During the months that followed, we worked closely with regulators and other investment banks in crafting the provisional settlement announced on December 20. While many of the new rules were initiated primarily to protect retail investors — not our market segment—we are determined to make them work. In addition, we are supportive of a proposed industry initiative that generally would prohibit allocations of initial public offerings to officers and directors of public companies. The new rules for research and for IPO allocations applicable in the U.S. may well form a template for our industry throughout the world. We have also attempted to play a positive role in the debate on corporate governance, accounting and regulatory reform, and, among other things, participated in the development of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act in the United States. As with the research settlement, there are areas of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that need to be clarified to prevent unintended consequences to the competitiveness of the U.S. capital markets. At the same time, one of the strengths of the U.S. system has always been its ability to respond to crisis with quick self-correc- tion. Passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was part of that process, and we support it as an important step towards rebuilding investor confidence. We believe that only by putting appropriate corporate governance mechanisms in place, and otherwise aligning the interests of management with shareholders, can there be sufficient focus on shareholder interests. In that connection, we refer you to our statement on “Promoting and Protect- ing Shareholder Interests”On February 7, 2003, Goldman Sachs entered into a series of related transactions with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) that include an investment of ¥150.3 billion ($1.25 billion) in convertible preferred stock of SMFG, the provision by SMFG of credit loss protection to Goldman Sachs and a broadening of cooperative initiatives between our two firms. We believe these transac- tions have strategic significance and real benefit to both organizations and their shareholders. For Goldman Sachs, it enables us to pursue three important objectives. First, it deepens our participa- tion in Japan and Japanese financial markets, through an investment in one of that nation’s largest and best-managed institutions. Second, the credit protection component will enhance Goldman Sachs’ ability to offer credit commitments to invest- ment-grade clients while mitigating in part the credit risk of doing so. Finally, the agreement with SMFG extends the range of cooperative initiatives between Goldman Sachs and SMFG, and areas
on which we anticipate working together will include the disposition of non-performing assets, investment banking and asset management. This transaction is especially meaningful, given the long and successful relationship between our firms, including Sumitomo Bank’s historic capital invest- ment of $500 million in Goldman Sachs initiated in 1986. In December, we announced that William George, former Chairman and CEO of Medtronic, Inc., was joining our Board of Directors. Bill fills the seat Steve Friedman left when he retired to become Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council. We will miss Steve’s contributions to the Board, although we are gratified that President Bush will have the benefit of his counsel. And we are fortunate to gain a new director of Bill’s caliber. Morris Chang and Meg Whitman also resigned as directors late in 2002. We are grateful for their dedication and insights as directors. In February 2003, in light of the announced retirement of Bob Hurst, the Board nominated Lloyd Blankfein, a Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs with responsi- bility for our securities businesses, to stand for election to our Board of Directors at the April 1 Annual Meeting. We look forward to having Lloyd as a new director and we thank Bob for his contributions to our Board. Over the past year we changed the ranks of our senior leadership to meet the challenging business environment and to ensure the best possible service to our clients. Lloyd Blankfein, Bob Steel and Rob Kaplan were appointed Vice Chairmen and asked to take on expanded man- agement responsibilities. In addition, Masanori Mochida, Suzanne Nora Johnson, John Weinberg, Gary Cohn, Chris Cole, Michael Evans, Scott Kapnick, Peter Kraus, Eric Mindich, Tom Montag, Eric Schwartz, Michael Sherwood and Andrew Melnick joined the firm’s Management Committee over the course of 2002. These individuals bring a wealth of talent and experience and a diversity of perspectives to the Committee. One of the most meaningful tests of individuals and organizations is how well they handle adver- sity. In 2002, the people of Goldman Sachs rose to meet the challenges of the environment and events with great distinction and considerable success. We anticipate that the coming year will con- tinue to be difficult, with slow growth in most of our major markets. The international situation, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, is of concern to us all, and will affect market conditions in ways that cannot be predicted. And we believe that close scrutiny of the securities industry and its role in the late 1990s bubble will continue. However, there is no question that today Goldman Sachs is a stronger firm than we were only a year ago, and well positioned to benefit from the broad secular forces that, despite recent setbacks, are driving profound and lasting global change. As a result, we have even greater confi- dence in Goldman Sachs’ longer-term prospects and success."
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2003,"Looking back on 2003, we take pride in our performance during a very challenging year. Net earnings in 2003 were $3.01 billion, a 42% increase from 2002. Earnings per diluted share (EPS) were $5.87, a 46% increase from 2002, and our second highest reported EPS as a public company. Our 2003 return on average shareholders' equity was 15%, up from 11% in 2002. Our return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 20%, well above the 15% earned in 2002. By its nature, our business doesn't lend itself to predictable recurring earnings. As we often remind our people, Goldman Sachs cannot control the market environment in which we work. But we can control our relative performance. By this standard, we judge 2003 to be a success and further evidence of the strength and resilience of our franchise. Despite our success in 2003, most of us will remember the past year as one in which we faced the continuing fallout from the collapse of the high-tech bubble and the series of corporate scandals that followed. It was an environment marked by sharp criticism and intense scrutiny of corporations generally, and financial services firms in particular.  At Goldman Sachs, we continue to experience enhanced regulatory scrutiny in all areas of our business. While at times not without challenges, we see this as an opportunity to learn from our mistakes, and those of others, as we strive to do all we can to restore investor confidence, to improve the structure and practices of financial markets and, above all, to strengthen our own policies and procedures. Our highest priority is to enhance our reputation for integrity in everything we do. It is a challenging agenda and the implications are far-reaching. Success will, to a large degree, be measured by the extent to which financial institutions like Goldman Sachs can continue to operate effectively. This is important because the role played by integrated investment banks—which bring together the providers and users of capital—is central to well-functioning capital markets and to sustained global growth. Firms like ours are in many ways agents of change. We facilitate entrepreneurship and innovation, help create opportunities for individuals and companies alike, and act as a catalyst for economic reform around the world. This year our letter is a little longer than usual because we address in more detail some of the most important opportunities and issues we face as a firm. Investment banking activity continued to suffer from diminished corporate and investor confidence in a tough business environment. Industry volumes for completed mergers decreased again in 2003 and equity underwriting volumes remained low. Global completed mergers decreased 17% from 2002, and were 70% below volumes in 2000, the prior peak. Our results reflected this difficult industry environment. Investment Banking net revenues were $2.71 billion, down 4% from 2002, and pre-tax earnings were $207 million, down from $376 million the year before. However, despite this difficult environment, we maintained our focus on serving clients and continued as the market leader in our core franchise businesses, including mergers and acquisitions, and IPO, equity, and equity-linked underwriting. In addition, we developed a prominent position in the issuance of high-yield securities. We think the strength of our franchise and the quality of our client relationships are evident in this performance. We do not, however, seek to be number one in all areas. Pursuing market share in some products makes no sense to us when the profitability is too small or non-existent. We believe that our role as a core advisor to clients has never been stronger. Our investment banking professionals continue to play a vital role in advising senior executives and a broad range of clients throughout the world. Through these relationships, our people are able to identify the needs of our clients and offer solutions by providing advice, products and services from across our firm. Once again in 2003, Trading and Principal Investments produced excellent results. Net revenues were $10.44 billion, a 21% increase from 2002. Pre-tax earnings were $3.51 billion, a 64% increase from 2002. We measure the effectiveness of our trading businesses by evaluating overall profitability relative to the risk we assume and the opportunities available. While there is no perfect measure of market risk, a topic we'll discuss later in this letter, our risk levels were higher in 2003 than in 2002. We were very pleased with the results our businesses were able to produce by effectively deploying incremental capital. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) had another record year, with net revenues of $5.60 billion, a 20% increase from 2002. During 2003, FICC operated in a generally favorable environment characterized by tightening corporate credit spreads, low interest rates, a steep yield curve and strong customer demand. As we look forward to 2004, we do not see clear signs that FICC activity levels will slow. However, we know that there is no such thing as a trading backlog and our business opportunities will always depend on the overall environment. One important aspect of our FICC business that is often overlooked is the range and diversity of activities it comprises. Within the five major areas of FICC—interest rates, credit, mortgages, currencies and commodities—are a wide range of individual operations around the globe. While there can be no guarantee about performance in any of our businesses, we believe that this diversity is an important strength. Our Equities business continued to face a very challenging environment. Equities net revenues of $4.28 billion increased 7% compared with 2002, primarily due to higher net revenues in principal strategies. While equity markets certainly improved in 2003 relative to the previous few years, conditions remained tough. Commission rates and spreads have continued to decline, the need to commit capital in a variety of circumstances is rising and volume growth is low. At Goldman Sachs, we have focused on the optimal size and structure for our Equities business in this difficult environment. We are pleased with the results of this effort, which we believe will be an important driver of future performance. Beginning with the appointment in 2002 of common management for our securities businesses, we have been more closely coordinating the activities of our FICC and Equities businesses to share best practices, capture synergies and drive efficiencies. In 2003, we continued this work, combining our Equities cash and derivatives client businesses under one leadership team. This builds on the experience of a similar combination in FICC in 2000 and will position us well to capture a range of opportunities. Research remains a critically important part of the Goldman Sachs franchise. We believe that a strong, differentiated research effort that is firmly aligned with the interests of our investing clients will be an important part of our Equities business for many years to come. Of course, 2003 began with the brokerage industry's global settlement with various regulators on equities research-related matters. As we have said before, in hindsight we and others could have done a better job. However, we had already begun implementing changes in our research business long before the final settlement, and we have been working diligently to comply in every respect with the new ground rules. We will continue to shape our research so that the qualities our clients value most—industry expertise, independent thinking and timely insights—are at the forefront of our proposition to investors. Our SLK stock specialist business, as well as the other specialists on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), have been, and continue to be, the subject of an intense regulatory review and enforcement action. Much attention has focused on the conduct of specialists within the existing NYSE rules, as well as potential changes to the rules governing the role of specialists. The role of the specialist and the rules of the NYSE should be evaluated against the proper objective—the development of the best market structure for all participants. In our view, the market structure of the future can take any number of forms, but the goal should be to produce a system that is fair to all investors and one where liquidity is maximized and investors can prioritize price, speed and cost of execution. We have in the past stated that we are not wedded to any particular market structure. Goldman Sachs is active and successful in markets around the world, many of which make greater use of electronic interfaces than the NYSE. In fact, we have invested in a number of electronic trading platforms. We believe, however, that the specialist performs a valuable role in maintaining an orderly market, particularly during times of market stress or when there are imbalances or dislocations with regard to a single stock. This system has helped to maintain the NYSE as the leading equities exchange in the world. We also believe investors are best served by large liquidity pools and greater use of electronic structures. By centralizing, rather than fragmenting, liquidity, investors will achieve the best possible outcomes. At this point, we are unable to predict the outcome of the regulatory review or the impact of potential reforms. We can assure you, however, that we will continue to cooperate fully with the regulators and to assist them in every way we can to develop the best equities market possible. Whatever changes are adopted, we feel confident in our ability to compete successfully across our equities franchise, which remains an industry leader. It is often reported in the media that we have increased our trading risk in recent years to offset the decline in investment banking activity levels. In fact, the same shocks and trends in the economy that have led to the sharp declines in investment banking have also created significant trading opportunities for our clients and for Goldman Sachs. We believe our willingness to take significant trading risk for appropriate reward is one of the distinguishing features of our firm and gives us a competitive advantage. We benefit in the marketplace because our clients—many of whom are among the world's largest and most sophisticated institutions—value our ability to tailor solutions and our willingness to commit our capital to meet their needs. Given the significant levels of risk we run in our business, we consider risk management to be one of our most vital functions. Risk management begins at the top of the firm with the establishment of risk limits for major business units and the involvement of our most senior people in critical decisions. In setting limits, there is no magic formula. But we do size our risk in proportion to our capital base and our overall earnings power. Since we went public in 1999, our shareholders' equity has grown more than threefold, to $21.63 billion as of November 2003. One principal tool we use to measure market risk is Value at Risk (VaR), a statistical measure of the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. We use a one-day horizon and a 95% level of confidence. This means that, about once a month, our actual daily trading revenues should be less than our expected daily trading revenues by an amount at least as large as our VaR. In 2003, our average daily VaR was $58 million. As important as it is to understand what VaR is telling you, it is important to understand what it is not telling you. VaR in no way captures a “worst case” scenario. Shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported VaR by a large amount. In addition, shortfalls can accumulate over a longer period, such as a number of consecutive trading days.  As a predictor of trading results, VaR historically has worked relatively well in stable markets and less well in very volatile and illiquid markets. Recognizing this fact, we also perform various scenario analyses, asking “What if?” about any number of possible events. These scenarios are used to establish limits and to attempt to keep our risk manageable. No one likes trading losses, but they are a feature of our business. In fact, it is our willingness to tolerate such occasional, sizeable losses that enables us to earn attractive returns over time. And, even when our trading businesses are performing well, results can be uneven. In 2003, our balance sheet grew, reflecting the higher activity levels in our trading and investing businesses and our willingness to deploy our capital to serve clients. While we face risks across every aspect of our business, access to liquidity remains the single most important issue for any financial services firm. There are many events that can create problems for a financial institution—macro events, trading losses, reputational damages, to name a few—but the most serious is a lack of liquidity. As a result, we place major emphasis on assuring our access to liquidity. The cornerstone of our approach is a “cushion” we maintain in the form of cash and highly liquid securities that averaged some $38 billion in 2003. We think of this cushion as liquidity support in the event of unexpected dislocations in financial markets.
The use of derivatives, a key part of our trading activity, has been the subject of increased debate recently. Derivatives span a wide range—from a simple interest rate swap that allows a company to convert its fixed rate borrowing into a floating rate exposure, to more complex instruments like credit derivatives that allow investors to hedge risk associated with credit exposures in their portfolios. While derivatives can be misused, they are a vital tool for risk management and risk dispersion. Over the last few years, we have witnessed seven of the ten largest corporate bankruptcies ever with surprisingly little dislocation in global credit markets. The dispersion of risk permitted by derivatives appears to have contributed very significantly to this outcome. Moreover, those financial institutions that have had some of the greatest problems in recent years were hurt in many cases by large unhedged exposures to equity markets. Of course, the use of derivatives, like other financial instruments, requires a rigorous, hands-on approach to risk management and control. These features were notably absent in some companies whose troubles have been widely publicized. At Goldman Sachs, we maintain an independent control function that monitors all of our trading positions and independently verifies their fair value. After two disappointing years, Principal Investments produced positive results in 2003. Net revenues increased to $566 million, up from negative $35 million in 2002. The increase was attributable to gains and overrides from real estate and corporate investments, including a $293 million unrealized gain on our investment in Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG). We expect the results from this business to be uneven, as there is a time lag between investing and harvesting. In 2003, we were fortunate to make a number of significant investments and we are optimistic about their return potential. We believe we have improved the quality of the portfolio in the last few years and have made some substantial investments that can drive the performance of this business over the cycle. We also sold some successful investments during 2003, including part of our holding in Kookmin Bank in South Korea. This deal highlights some of the characteristics of our business that we believe stand us in good stead for the future: our global reach and relationships, our willingness to deploy significant capital swiftly and our ability to take a long view. Our investment in convertible preferred stock of SMFG carries with it significant volatility. We hold the investment at fair value, which is derived primarily from SMFG's common share price. Since our investment in February 2003, SMFG's share price has closed as low as ¥164,000 and as high as ¥665,000. Significant changes in SMFG's share price produce significant changes in the fair value of our investment, which we report as net revenues each quarter. Our decision to invest in SMFG was based on our long-term confidence in Japan and the opportunity to strengthen our relationship with one of the most important financial institutions in Japan. Short-term fluctuations in the value of SMFG are not cause for particular concern to us, as long as the fundamentals of SMFG are steady and improving, which we believe to be the case.Our Asset Management and Securities Services business had an excellent year. Net revenues were $2.86 billion, a 14% increase from 2002. Pre-tax earnings were $968 million in 2003, compared with $947 million in 2002. In Asset Management, net revenues were $1.85 billion, a 12% increase from 2002, primarily reflecting an increase in average assets under management, the contribution from the acquisition of Ayco and increased incentive income. Total assets under management increased 7% to a record $373 billion. Two closely related factors are critical to building our business: the ability to generate attractive investment performance and the ability to raise new assets. During 2003, our investment performance, together with our distribution strength, allowed us to generate $15 billion of net client inflows across non-money market asset classes. These increases were offset by $19 billion of outflows in money market assets, as economic prospects improved and higher returns were being generated in other asset classes. Within our Securities Services business, net revenues were $1.01 billion, up 17% from 2002. This business continues to benefit from the creation and growth of new and existing hedge funds. In addition, the rally in equity markets helped to increase customer balances. We believe our Asset Management and Securities Services business represents one of our best opportunities for substantial growth. Managing expenses in this challenging environment has been one of our highest priorities. During 2003, excluding the impact of acquisitions, we reduced our headcount by 7%. While painful, these reductions were necessary to scale our operations to the available opportunities and were a key factor in our ability to generate an attractive return in 2003. Our largest expense—in a people business—is compensation, and we track this expense as a percentage of the net revenues we generate in our businesses overall. For 2003, the ratio of compensation to net revenues was 46% versus 48% in 2002. We remain focused on controlling our non-compensation expenses. However, there are some areas that remain difficult to forecast. For instance, in 2003 we took provisions of $159 million for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings. Given the range of litigation and investigations underway, these expenses may remain high. Goldman Sachs is not a financial services conglomerate but an integrated investment bank, securities firm and asset manager. This focused strategy has allowed us to build a strong global franchise—we take pride in being a market leader in Europe and Asia as well as the United States. It has also allowed us to benefit from the long-term growth of the global capital markets which we believe will continue to provide us with excellent growth opportunities over the cycle. We aspire to be the preeminent global provider of advisory, financing, investment and risk management services to corporations, institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. To succeed in this mission, the firm has always placed great reliance on attracting and retaining outstanding people. And we work hard to foster teamwork and encourage creativity, client focus and innovation. We believe that our unique culture, coupled with the quality of our people, is Goldman Sachs' most important competitive strength. Our business has always been highly competitive and cyclical. We face strong competition today, as in the past, from larger competitors, but we don't view our size as a competitive disadvantage because we have never been constrained by a lack of capital. We believe our biggest challenge is to strengthen our culture of teamwork and excellence in the face of the growing size and scope of our business. We are determined to meet this challenge because we believe our ability to do so is critical to our continued success in executing our global strategy and serving our clients. In 2003, we completed a number of strategic transactions. Our first announcement involved our $1.25 billion investment in SMFG, which we mentioned above. We are pleased with the performance of our investment as well as the other aspects of our relationship with SMFG. With the credit loss protection provided by SMFG, we initiated our William Street credit extension program. This capability has given us an innovative way to extend credit selectively to our investment-grade clients, while reducing our credit and liquidity risks. By the end of fiscal 2003, $4.32 billion of credit commitments had been made under the program. In addition, our business cooperation agreement with SMFG has already resulted in a number of initiatives. In October, we announced the formation of a joint venture to facilitate the corporate recovery of certain SMFG borrowing clients and to accelerate SMFG's plans to improve its asset quality. In September, we combined our Australian operations with JBWere to create a new venture called Goldman Sachs JBWere. We own 45% of the new entity, one of the leading investment banking and securities firms in Australia. We also made several acquisitions in 2003. Our approach to acquisitions is to strengthen our business and build shareholder value, principally through emphasizing bolt-on deals where we can add new clients or acquire new products to provide to our existing clients. 2003 offered us a number of such opportunities. In July, we acquired The Ayco Company, a leading provider of sophisticated, fee-based financial counseling in the United States. Ayco enables us to develop further our high-net-worth and asset management businesses by using its extensive portfolio of financial planning capabilities, including tax, estate and charitable planning services. We also made two acquisitions of power generation assets. In October, we acquired East Coast Power, owner of the 940-megawatt cogeneration facility in Linden, New Jersey, which sells some 80% of its power to the New York City market. In the same month, we announced the acquisition of Cogentrix Energy, an independent power producer based in Charlotte, North Carolina, adding interests in 26 power plants and 3,300 megawatts of generating capacity to our portfolio. These generation facilities were acquired to complement our existing commodity trading and merchant energy restructuring capabilities. Of course, ownership of physical power assets brings incremental responsibilities of which we are particularly mindful. In June, we announced that Claes Dahlbäck, nonexecutive Chairman of Investor AB, and Edward M. Liddy, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Allstate Corporation, were joining our Board of Directors. Claes and Ed are both distinguished business leaders as well as thoughtful corporate directors, and we welcome the contributions they are already making to the Board. The Board has also nominated Lois D. Juliber, Chief Operating Officer of the Colgate-Palmolive Company, to stand for election to our Board of Directors at the March 31 Annual Meeting. In addition, John Thain and John Thornton retired as directors and we thank them for their service on our Board and to our shareholders. On balance, 2003 proved to be a more favorable operating environment than we expected at the beginning of the year. Markets rose, economic growth improved in most major economies and business confidence rose. Although we expect these trends to continue in 2004, we cannot, of course, predict with certainty what global events, economic or political, in fact will shape the markets in which we work. But, we can_nd will_ursue a strategy that permits us to seize business opportunities in an environment of continuing uncertainty and possible volatility. We owe you, our shareholders, nothing less. In terms of our own industry, it is clear that, if anything, regulatory scrutiny has intensified in the U.S. and in other countries around the world. We anticipate that this will continue to be a feature of the environment in which we operate. That said, we look forward with confidence to 2004 and beyond. Our franchise is stronger than ever. Our people remain focused, dedicated and enthusiastic. We are committed to serving you, our shareholders, by delivering long-term growth and by producing real value for our clients through products and services that strengthen the global capital markets and support economic growth."
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2004,"2004 was an outstanding year for Goldman Sachs—
the strongest performance in the firm’s history. Net revenues increased 28% to a record $20.55 billion and net earnings rose 52% to a record $4.55 billion. Earnings per diluted share (EPS) were $8.92, the highest we have ever reported, and our return on average tangible shareholders’ equity was 25%, compared with 20% in 2003. Our success in 2004 can be attributed to many factors and demonstrates the remarkable potential of our firm. Most importantly, our results reflect the strength of our franchise, the depth of our client relationships across all of our businesses and our leading positions in the most important financial markets around the world. We also benefited from steps taken in earlier, more difficult years to restructure certain of our businesses and build for the future.  This year, like many before it, was marked by a number of rapidly shifting markets. Our ability to navigate these changes and effectively manage our risks strengthened our results. As we have remarked before, we cannot control the environment, but we strive to outperform our peers in all market environments. We are particularly pleased that our relative performance was very strong.  It is worth noting that we won’t always be as fortunate as we were in 2004. But we are energized by the challenge and optimistic about the future. Our long-term success has deep roots—in our client relationships, our willingness to commit capital and to manage risk, our global reach, our nimbleness and, above all, our people and reputation. It is the combination of these attributes that enabled us to serve our clients and to generate attractive returns for our shareholders in 2004.  Along with people around the world, Goldman Sachs was stunned by the devastation caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis in South Asia in late December 2004. Our response was immediate and focused. Within hours of the disaster, the firm was working to ensure that our people in the area were safe. Within days, we had partnered with our contacts in the non-profit community— including CARE, Japan Red Cross Society, the International Rescue Committee and AmeriCares — to identify the most urgent needs in the regions and to provide assistance to those impacted by the disaster. Beyond our immediate response, Goldman Sachs remains committed to assisting over the long term through supporting initiatives to rebuild the physical and economic infrastructures of the impacted countries. We believe that our business success is accompanied by a responsibility to act, and the response of our people to this tragedy underscores the strength of this belief throughout the firm.  Investment banking activity began to recover during 2004. Global completed mergers and acquisitions increased 33% compared with 2003 and worldwide common stock issuance nearly doubled. Our net revenues in Investment Banking increased 24% to $3.37 billion and pre-tax earnings almost doubled to $401 million.  In 2004, we maintained leadership positions in our most important high-margin businesses. In mergers and acquisitions, we ranked number one globally in announced and completed activity for the seventh consecutive year and advised on seven of the ten largest completed transactions. We also demonstrated the strength of our equity underwriting franchise, ranking second in worldwide common stock and initial public offerings with leadership positions in every major region. In leveraged finance, we continued to strengthen our global business and we have been at the forefront of the growth of the hybrid loan market, particularly working with financial sponsor clients. In a period in which trading results are more significant than ever to the industry’s performance, some may under- estimate the importance of Investment Banking. We believe it is difficult to overstate the importance of Investment Banking to our firm. Our traditional role as an advisor and underwriter will always be a critical part of our business. In addition, in today’s rapidly changing markets, corporate clients are increasingly asking us to help them manage their risk by acting as a principal. These opportunities are an attractive source of transactions and come from the strength of our relationships and the depth of our market knowledge.  To better serve our clients, in 2004 we created a global financing group by combining our traditional equity and debt capital markets underwriting areas with our financing and liability hedging businesses. Through this combination, we are able to offer our clients a full range of customized financing and hedging alternatives to meet their needs more effectively. Early in 2005, the financing group was combined with Investment Banking, bringing together our strategic, corporate-facing businesses.  Delivering the resources of the entire firm to our clients in a seamless fashion, with Investment Banking as “front of the house,” is one of the most challenging things we do. It is also one of the most rewarding. Our ability to serve our clients with firmwide resources is a critical competitive advantage and stems directly from our culture of teamwork.  Barring unforeseen shocks, we expect a continued gradual recovery in the level of investment banking activity. Capital raising and strategic activity are directly linked to economic growth as well as to CEO and investor confidence. While confidence has certainly increased from the lows of a few years ago, further increases are needed to produce more robust Investment Banking results.  Trading and Principal Investments once again produced a record performance in 2004. Net revenues increased 28% to $13.33 billion and pre-tax earnings were up 44% to $5.04 billion.  Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) produced a remarkable performance, with net revenues of $7.32 billion up 31% from 2003’s record. Throughout 2004, the environment for our FICC businesses changed continually. While absolute interest rates remained low, the yield curve flattened during the year as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates four times. Credit spreads ended the year at very tight levels. Currency markets, dormant for much of the year, moved dramatically in the fourth quarter as the U.S. dollar declined markedly. Commodities prices were exceptionally volatile throughout the year, prompting record levels of activity by producers and consumers of energy and raw materials.  Against this backdrop, our strong performance under- scores the breadth of our customer franchise across FICC. Each of our major FICC businesses—interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies and commodities—is large enough to have a meaningful impact on FICC’s overall results in any quarter. At the same time, it is rare for any one of these businesses to be a dominant portion of our total FICC net revenues in a given period. Coupled with our culture of outstanding client service, we believe this “strength in breadth” has been a critical advantage in recent years and positions us well for the future.  As we enter a period of rising interest rates, many wonder about the potential effect on our FICC performance. Our experience is that customer activity is the key driver of FICC.  Clients are drawn to the market by the desire to hedge, to reallocate investments, to capture upside or to limit downside. Today, with deep and liquid derivatives markets and a broader client base than ever before, the existence of a trend in prices and activity has become as important as the direction of prices. These developments, coupled with the diversity of our FICC businesses, helps to explain why the increase in interest rates in 2004 did not lead to dramatic declines in FICC revenues. To be clear, this does not mean that risk has been reduced. On the contrary, our willingness to take and manage risk is more critical than ever to our clients, who are the core of our trading franchise. Turning to our other major trading business, Equities net revenues grew 9% in 2004 to $4.67 billion. Our equities products group net revenues increased as a result of higher customer activity in shares and derivatives globally. The principal strategies group also recorded higher net revenues compared with 2003. While equity markets increased in the early part of 2004, much of the year was characterized by directionless markets, with lower volumes and declining volatility, before a pickup in the last weeks of our fiscal year.  The equities business continues to face significant challenges, including declining commission rates driven by intense competition and our clients’ focus on managing trans- action costs. These challenges in turn create new requirements for us. For example, our clients more frequently ask us to trade for them in a way that guarantees their execution price rather than by having us act as a pure intermediary. This can still be excellent business for us, but it places demands on our capital and requires us to accept greater risk than we did in the past.  In addition, the structure of equity markets continues to be in a state of flux, with trading rule changes and market reforms being contemplated by a range of regulatory bodies. While our success is not tied to any particular equity market structure, we will try to determine the optimal outcome for our clients and our shareholders as alternatives are reviewed. Regardless of the structure of markets, our primary goal is to continue to serve our clients and thereby retain our leadership in global equities.  While some of these developments are challenging, we have been pleased with our performance in Equities. We believe our strength across the trading business equips us very well to adapt to changes in the way equities are traded. As with FICC, the size and breadth of our Equities franchise is key. It includes our sales and trading operation, a leading direct market access capability, a dominant prime broker, our long-standing proprietary trading business and a commitment to providing world class research.  In Equities, we reduced costs during the downturn of 2001-2003 and, more importantly, restructured our business to address the challenges outlined above. We have also worked to match service levels to our clients’ needs and our own revenue potential. This effort has involved some difficult decisions about where we should focus, but we believe it is firmly in the interests of our clients and share- holders that we concentrate our resources where they will have the most impact.  Principal Investments had strong results in 2004, with net revenues more than doubling to $1.33 billion. This included a $771 million unrealized gain on our investment in convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), reflecting a continued economic recovery in Japan. Almost two years after we invested $1.25 billion, our convertible preferred is now carried at $2.56 billion. We are very pleased with this investment, which was made possible by our strong relationship with SMFG, developed over many years. It is a prime example of our willingness to commit capital to the mutual benefit of our clients and our shareholders. Our traditional corporate and real estate investing business also performed very well in 2004, generating gains and overrides of $561 million. After the technology and telecom boom of the late 1990s, we returned this business to its traditional merchant banking model of investing larger amounts in mature companies. This strategy paid off in 2004, as we were able to take advantage of the credit and equity markets recoveries and harvest some of these investments. And we continue to identify attractive opportunities to invest our capital in this business.  We view principal investing as a vital part of an integrated investment bank. Our success in this area stems partly from our role as an innovator. We helped lead the way in partnering with other private equity investors, many of whom are also our clients, to supply the capital required for larger deals and to spread risk among a wider investor base. We continue to see this strategy as important to our future success and another example of how multiple relationships can be managed for the benefit of our clients.  Our Asset Management and Securities Services businesses had an excellent year. Net revenues were up 35% to a record $3.85 billion, and pre-tax earnings rose 47% to a record $1.42 billion.  In Asset Management, net revenues grew 38% to a record $2.55 billion, as assets under management grew and incentive fees for exceeding performance benchmarks set a new record. Net inflows during 2004 were very strong, totaling $52 billion across all asset classes, while market appreciation added $27 billion. As a result, year-end assets under management reached a record $452 billion. There is no more direct testament to the performance of our investment strategies than our success in attracting new assets. This was an exceptional year overall for Asset Management, with strong asset growth and expanding margins.  Securities Services posted record net revenues of $1.30 billion, up 29% from 2003. We continue to benefit from trends in hedge fund formation, activity levels and asset flows. We have also had success in winning new mandates  despite ever-increasing competition. Securities Services is
an excellent business, which we have built over many years. Our consistent commitment to high-quality service for our clients has made us an industry leader.  Asset Management and Securities Services continue to offer some of our most attractive opportunities for future growth. Our total operating expenses increased 20% in 2004, against
a net revenues increase of 28%. Most of our expenses related to compensation and benefits, and a majority of that was discretionary year-end compensation based on the performance of the firm and our people. Compensation and benefits were 46.7% of net revenues in 2004, against 46.2% in 2003. This reflects our strong performance as well as an increasingly competitive environment for talented people. Keeping our team together is critically important and, more than ever,
we have worked hard to be fair and appropriate in our compensation decisions. We have always approached compensation decisions from the bottom up. Rather than allocating dollars based on a rigid share of net revenues, we try to determine the right amount of compensation for each individual’s contribution to the firm’s performance. This takes time and effort, but we believe it is repaid in our ability to attract and retain people for the long term, without relying on multiyear bonus guarantees. Headcount grew for the first time in several years during 2004, up 6% to 20,722. Non-compensation expenses were $4.22 billion, up 4% compared with 2003. Most of the year-over-year increase came from higher levels of business activity and higher professional fees. Looking forward, we want to emphasize that while expenses will inevitably increase in a stronger business and economic environment, we continue to focus hard on controlling discretionary costs. That said, we have little control over the escalating costs related to increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny of our industry, as well as litigation. In addition to provisions for legal and regulatory proceedings, which amounted to $103 million in 2004, we continue to incur legal fees associated with such matters as well as expenses related to compliance with new legislative and regulatory requirements and investigations. These costs include not only the direct expense of new internal processes and additional people, but also a significant investment of senior management time and focus. We touched earlier on the importance of combining a strong customer franchise with a willingness to commit capital on behalf of our clients. We believe that this has been — and will continue to be — critical to our success. Across our many businesses, our client franchise is second to none. At the same time, our trading and risk management is best in class. Critically, we believe that we combine these attributes as well as or better than any other firm. Of course, committing capital requires us to take risk. We believe our willingness to take meaningful risk for appropriate reward is one of the distinguishing features of our firm. It is what places risk management at the center of our core competencies. One measure of our market risk-taking is Value-at-Risk (VaR), a statistical measure of potential loss in the value of our trading positions over a defined time horizon with a specified level of confidence. In 2004, our average daily VaR was $67 million, 16% higher than the $58 million average in 2003. During the year, the components of VaR, which include risks related to interest rates, equity prices, currencies and commodities, varied significantly. This illustrates the extent to which we dynamically allocate risk capital to take advantage of perceived opportunities. As we have said before, VaR is only one risk management tool. It does not capture worst case outcomes, and we continue to use scenario analyses, stress testing and other analytical tools as key components of our risk management discipline. In addition, we constantly analyze imbalances in global markets which may affect our clients and our firm. For example, in the past year many have commented on unprecedented global liquidity, narrow credit spreads and the rapid pace of hedge fund formation. We monitor these risks carefully, although we believe that hedge funds and credit products as asset classes will continue to grow over time. Competition in our businesses continues to be intense. A few years ago, many thought that there would be significant consolidation in our industry, with weaker players being acquired by larger firms trying to enter the investment banking and securities business. Instead, large and well-funded competitors have been growing their presence organically, adding to excess capacity in many areas. Notwithstanding their efforts, we are pleased with our competitive strength and breadth across our core businesses.  Many of our competitors are much larger and conduct a wider range of businesses than we do. We do not view the size of our firm as a disadvantage, because we have never been constrained by a lack of capital. Furthermore, in most of the businesses in which we compete, we are at least as large as any other competitor. We view our focus as an advantage that helps us attract high-quality people who share our culture of teamwork and serving our clients through excellence. We believe that the experience of the last few years supports our judgment that size and diversification by themselves are not the universal advantages that many have believed them to be. In our view, many of the synergies sought in the combination of disparate businesses are difficult to achieve. Just as important, managing and controlling a wide array of global businesses is likely to prove even more challenging in an environment of increasing regulatory scrutiny. We think our focused business model has served us well, and that was particularly evident in our performance relative to our key competitors in 2004.  Our greatest challenge is to continue to execute to the highest standard as we grow larger. As always, the most important factor will be our ability to recruit and retain talented people and preserve our distinctive culture of teamwork. In this effort, we face competition both from traditional firms and from private pools of capital such as hedge funds and private equity businesses. But in a challenging environment, we are pleased with our success in keeping our team together. We believe that our partnership culture has played a vital role in maintaining our position as an employer of choice in our industry. The financial services industry continues to be subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. Contrary to what many had predicted and some may still think, the scope of this scrutiny has continued unabated in the last year. We accept this scrutiny as an ongoing part of our business, and are working very hard to maintain the highest standards in our business practices.  One significant part of our response was the establishment of the firm’s Business Practices Committee more than a year ago. The Business Practices Committee, which evolved from our Global Compliance and Control Committee, is part of our continuing effort to reinforce the firm’s culture of integrity and our commitment to excellence in compliance and reputational judgment. In addition to oversight of compliance and operational risks, the committee reviews the firm’s policies and procedures for consistency with our business principles as well as regulatory requirements. The committee’s oversight is intended to mitigate potential risks and to ensure full adherence to our business principles. Some of the firm’s most senior leaders are members of the committee, including our President, Vice Chairs and other Managing Directors (MD) engaged in our core businesses and risk management functions. At Goldman Sachs, we have always considered our assets to be our people, our capital and our reputation, the last being the most difficult to restore if ever lost. When we look back to the late 1990s, we wish that we had differentiated ourselves more positively than we did. While we cannot remedy past errors of judgment, we know that we must learn from them. Over the last three years, we have implemented a firmwide program of Compliance and Reputational Judgment training to reinforce our compliance culture. In 2005, as part of our continuing efforts, we will be hosting a Chairman’s Forum which will include every MD of the firm. This will involve us in more than 20 meetings with small groups of our MDs at which we will discuss at length business practices, reputational judgment and compliance leadership. We will emphasize to all our MDs that our highest priority is to enhance our reputation for integrity in every aspect of our business.  Business conflicts continue to be a particularly important area of focus for us. How we identify, disclose and manage real and apparent conflicts of interest will be critical to
the long-term success of our business. We operate with the knowledge that what many may have considered acceptable  industry practice yesterday will be the target of intense scrutiny tomorrow. We must conduct ourselves accordingly and ensure that we have thoroughly and thoughtfully analyzed all of our business priorities. At the same time,
it is nai_ve to think that we can operate without conflicts. They are embedded in our role as a valued intermediary — between providers and users of capital and those who want to shed risk versus those who are willing to assume it. Like every industry, ours faces conflicting interests and the relevant question must be: How do we effectively manage them?
We will continue to devote substantial effort and resources to this important issue. We must also stay focused on the growth and develop- ment of our business. We firmly believe that the integrated investment bank, intermediating capital flows and providing advice to clients, has a central role to play in the efficient functioning of capital markets, which in turn is vital to sustained, long-term global growth.  Goldman Sachs is not a financial services conglomerate but an integrated investment bank, securities firm and asset manager. Although we analyze many potential transactions, we remain focused on finding ways to grow that are consistent with and complementary to this basic strategy. During 2004, we completed some important strategic transactions.  Asia is a region of great opportunity and China has been a strategic priority for our firm for many years. In December, we announced that we had received official approval to establish a joint venture investment banking and securities firm in China. This was the culmination of a significant long- term effort to obtain a domestic license in this critical market. We are already a leader in providing advisory services to some of China’s most important companies and bringing them to the international capital markets. Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Company Limited will enable us for the first time to offer a wide range of investment banking and securities trading services to Chinese clients in their domestic market. Specifically, the joint venture will be able to underwrite locally listed “A” share transactions and Renminbi-denominated corporate bonds and convertible bonds, as well as offer domestic advisory services and undertake other investment banking activities. The establishment of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities is a crucial step in the development of our business in one of the world’s most important economies. In September 2004, we agreed to acquire interests in 11 power plants in six U.S. states for approximately $550 million. From our earlier acquisition of Cogentrix Energy, we already had ownership interests in nine of the 11 plants. With its closing on January 31, 2005, this transaction continues our strategy of acquiring what we believe to be attractively priced power assets to complement our existing commodity trading and merchant energy restructuring capabilities.  Lois D. Juliber, a Vice Chairman of the Colgate-Palmolive Company, was elected to the Board of Directors at the 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Lois has played a central role in extending Colgate’s business to over 200 countries. We are fortunate to benefit from her international depth and experience. In addition, on November 29, 2004, we were pleased to announce that Suzanne M. Nora Johnson was appointed a Vice Chairman of the firm. Suzanne’s career at Goldman Sachs has spanned nearly 20 years. She will continue to head our Global Investment Research division and to lead our efforts with the new Global Markets Institute.  Our leadership team was also enhanced by the February 2004 appointment of Alan M. Cohen, formerly a partner in the law firm of O’Melveny & Myers LLP, as Global Head of Compliance. Alan’s extensive experience in private practice and his tenure as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, position him well to lead this critically important area of the firm.  At the end of 2004, we expanded our senior leadership by selecting 98 new partners of the firm and 190 new MDs. They are a superb new generation of leaders who we believe will help to ensure the continued success of Goldman Sachs.  As we begin 2005, we continue to see significant potential across the firm. Investment banking activity appears to be recovering gradually, equity markets have improved from the summer of 2004 and the environment across our FICC businesses remains broadly favorable. In managing the firm, we remain focused on our clients, and our people are as dedicated and enthusiastic as ever. We believe the people of Goldman Sachs are second to none in the industry.  As we look ahead, the cornerstones of our business are unchanged—serving our clients’ needs, capitalizing on market opportunities as they emerge and harnessing the entrepreneurial talents of our people.

Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2005,"Fellow Shareholders: 
This past year was a successful one for Goldman Sachs, reflecting both a robust market environment and strong performance across all of our major businesses. For 2005, net revenues increased 21% to $24.8 billion and net earnings rose 24% to $5.6 billion. Earnings per diluted common share (EPS) were up 26%. Our return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity was 28%. Book value per common share has grown from $20.94 at the end of our first year as a public company in 1999 to $57.02 at our fiscal year-end on November 25, 2005, an annually com- pounded rate of 18% over this period. 
Although Goldman Sachs cannot control the business environment in which we operate and we fully expect to encounter far more difficult years than 2005, we are responsible for how well we identify and capitalize on the opportunities potentially available to us. Our ability to do this is dependent on the long-term strength of our franchise. That strength is rooted in deep client relation- ships, market knowledge, risk management expertise and leading positions in the most important financial markets around the world. These attributes have allowed us to grow our net revenues at an annually compounded rate of 11%—nearly twice the rate of global GDP growth—since 1999. 
Structural Developments in Financial Markets and Evolving Client Needs 
In this year’s letter, we want to discuss the broad structural trends that are driving financial markets and how Goldman Sachs, by leveraging the skills and market knowledge of our people, is responding to these trends to best meet the needs of our clients and, by extension, provide value to our shareholders. 
The Global Integration of Economies and Markets 
It is easy to get lost in abstraction when discussing capital markets, but the global integration of economies and markets holds the promise of a more prosperous and secure world. We are convinced of the power of globalization to effect positive change by promoting growth, creating jobs, fostering competition and encouraging reform. As such, we consider it appropriate to speak about broad issues related to international trade, investment and economic reform in developed and less developed countries. 
Still, the competition for capital, resources and labor can be a wrenching process. While it is important not to minimize the cost of dislocation, increasing global financial integration can channel savings into projects that will maximize global economic growth. This will provide governments, investors and society, more broadly, the means to meet their future liabilities. Given the aging populations in Western Europe, Japan and the United States, these needs become more pressing each day. 
One clear consequence of economic and financial integration is the rise of global competition for capital. Investors are able to allocate their capital far more directly than in previous decades. They are less interested in the particular market on which a company is listed, and instead are more focused on the fundamentals of the environments in which the company operates and on
its performance relative to global peers. 
We believe that global capital markets will play a vital role as countries pursue market-based reform. For instance, as China transforms itself from a manufacturer of low-cost goods to a higher value-added producer, it will need the capital allocation that deep, liquid financial markets can provide. Over the last 20 years, economic growth in China and India has begun to lift hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty. Capital flows have increased significantly as investors around the world have sought to participate in this growth. In Japan, reform seems to be lifting the economy out of its lengthy stagnation, attracting increasing levels of foreign capital
as investors respond to signs of a recovery and growing domestic demand. Dynamic growth in China and India, the economic renaissance in Japan, and encouraging indications of a recovery in the German economy are among the focal points for global capital flows and they offer attractive opportunities for global investment banks. 
Price Discovery as a Commodity 
As global economic integration — and the technological advances that help fuel it — continue to reshape markets, the role of financial intermediaries has evolved. Not so long ago, investment banks were paid by clients to estab- lish or determine the prevailing bid or ask price for a stock, bond or other financial instrument. The advent of electronic execution and price display systems, providing instantaneous access to market data, has reduced execution costs and increased trading volumes. This has permitted 
us to substitute technology for human capital in markets where price discovery has become commoditized, while creating opportunities to offer both high-volume, commodity- like securities trades and more sophisticated and higher value-added services. 
Advice Across the Capital Spectrum 
Investment banks still provide value-added judgments on the pricing of securities such as new issues, or when large positions or other liquidity restraints are involved. More frequently, however, we are asked for our advice in the design, origination, pricing and use of securities, which might impact a company’s overall capital structure or help clients better manage their assets and liabilities. These instruments, most notably derivatives, have improved the ability of market participants to manage, disperse and target risk. Consequently, companies are able to think more broadly about their entire capital structure and investors have additional tools to help manage the risk in 
their portfolios. With more varied solutions available, we believe sound advice and market judgment are particu- larly important for corporate issuers and investors. 
Private Pools of Capital 
The development of new, sophisticated financial instruments has coincided with the proliferation and rapid growth
of assets under management of private equity and hedge funds. Because hedge funds are not bound by the restrictions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, they can use strategies and instruments that “long-only” mutual funds cannot. In doing so, they seek to mitigate risk while optimizing market returns. While many of the more than 8,000 hedge funds today will over time likely fail to generate the performance they expect and may ultimately go out of business, we believe the industry, led by superior investment organizations, will continue to grow—though at a slower rate — consolidate and evolve. For investors, the need to generate higher returns while diversifying risk makes hedge funds a permanent fixture on the investment land- scape. Although the approximately $1 trillion managed by hedge funds represents a small portion of total assets under management globally, their influence is dispropor- tionate to their size. They provide significant levels of liquidity and, as a result, influence prices for securities across virtually all markets. 
Although an increasing number of hedge funds are participating in private equity-style investments, providing bridge loans or other types of financing or engaging in real estate transactions, we believe that private equity firms will continue to play a distinctive and significant role in buying and selling companies. Today, capital invested in private equity has surpassed $1 trillion, and in 2005, ten firms had either raised or were in the process of raising individual funds of more than $5 billion. We expect this trend to continue. The amount of capital raised and private equity firms’ ability to deploy that capital is likely to increase financial sponsors’ share of total mergers and acquisitions activity over time. 
Commitment of Capital 
Another key trend is the increasing demand from clients for investment banks to combine capital and advice. In other words, investment banks are expected to commit more of their own capital when executing transactions. This can mean hedging a corporate client’s exposure to currency fluctuation in a cross-border acquisition, guaranteeing 
an execution price to a client selling a large block of 
debt or equity, or providing the financing for a corporate client involved in a leveraged buyout. Investment banks are increasingly using their own balance sheets to extend credit to clients, to assume market risk on their behalf and sometimes to co-invest alongside them. 
Our Business 
We believe that a differentiating strength of Goldman Sachs is our nimbleness in adapting to changing market trends in order to meet the needs of our clients. We are a client-driven firm and, because of this, we remind ourselves continually that we are only as good as our clients think we are. 
Investment Banking 
One important manifestation of our commitment to serving our clients is the quality and global breadth of our corporate investment banking franchise. In our corporate advisory business, our global preeminence in mergers and acquisitions is a direct result of the creativity, knowledge and client focus of our people. Their value is evidenced each day in the strategic advice we provide to companies — practical, well-informed advice grounded in the breadth and depth of our knowledge of, and participation in, financial markets around the world. Through our leading position in the market as an underwriter of a company’s debt or equity instruments, we help clients raise capital to build new businesses or strengthen existing ones. In the process, we commit our capital to help our clients meet their financing needs on the most attractive terms available. Investment banking serves as the main initial point of contact with all of Goldman Sachs for our clients to find creative and comprehensive solutions to complex problems. 
Integrating Advice and Capital 
Our sales and trading activities are sometimes thought to be divorced from our client businesses. The reality is quite different. As the capital markets have evolved, creating an increasingly greater nexus between capital and advice, so has the role of financial intermediary. 
Today, we provide integrated solutions that help our clients to manage, disperse, reduce or aggregate risk in order to achieve their objectives.We serve a broad array of corporate, government, institutional and high-net- worth clients around the world. An important reason these clients come to Goldman Sachs is that we are
well suited to integrate strategic advice, market knowledge, risk management expertise, and financing and trading 
skills. Our culture of teamwork strengthens our position as the advisor, financier, co-investor and financial intermediary of choice. 
Securities Sales and Trading 
Our securities sales and trading businesses include dozens of distinct areas from equity products and currency options to structured credit and energy futures—and each of these businesses has many sub-businesses around the world. They allow us to provide our investing and corporate invest- ment banking clients with liquidity, capital, market access and knowledge as well as risk management expertise. 
In the securities markets, the needs of our investing clients and the volatility of markets do not always present a simple choice between assuming and avoiding risk. Certainly, a significant portion of our business occurs when we act as agent. We do so, for example, through our strong market position in electronically executing equities transactions. Today, more than 2,000 organizations around the world use our REDIPlus® direct market access system and our algorithmic execution tools. In aggregate, we trade some 650 million shares per day on an agency basis through these electronic execution channels, offering single stock and portfolio level capabilities. 
While we have seen rapid growth in low-touch, low- commission electronic trading, we also have experienced a marked increase in principal trading in recent years. In our equities business, commissions represent the largest single revenue stream. However, the bulk of these com- missions are earned because we assume market risk or make a capital commitment to execute client trades. Some may confuse acting as a principal with taking a proprietary posi- tion. As a principal, we assume market risk to facilitate trades for our clients. Our clients expect us to provide the necessary liquidity, as a market maker, to ensure that buyers and sellers can complete their trades. In doing so, sometimes we either opt or are forced by market conditions to hold positions in the near term, while a client’s transac- tion, the underlying reason for the trade, is completed. 
The vast majority of our trading revenue is generated from our role as a financial intermediary and broker to our investing clients. Year after year, we serve the same clients who have come to rely on our advice, market insight, risk appetite and execution capability to help them navigate the securities markets. An increasing percentage of our sales and trading revenue comes from our derivatives and structured products businesses. We are a leader in credit derivatives and see significant growth opportunities in this area as well as in other derivative products in the years ahead. Our sales and trading activities produce a diverse revenue stream that has attractive long-term growth potential and is protected by a strong global franchise with high barriers to entry. These revenues, however, like any based on capital market conditions and customer activity levels, are difficult to predict, particularly on a quarterly basis. 
In addition, we have proprietary investing groups in the securities divisions that have been a successful part
of our business for many decades. These businesses, where we invest the firm’s own capital, have generated high returns over time and increase the diversity of our business mix. They also contribute to our franchise as we co-invest or provide capital to meet client needs. 
Investment Management 
We are proud of the steady, organic growth of our invest- ment management business. Assets under management have more than doubled to $532 billion since we went public, and today we manage more than $100 billion 
in each of our main categories of money markets, fixed income and currency, equity and alternative investments.
In 2005 alone, we raised $63 billion of new, fee-based client assets including significant year-over-year growth in fee-based assets in our private wealth management business serving high-net-worth clients. A portion of our assets under management provides us with a growing opportunity to supplement our base level of revenues with considerable incentive revenues earned when we achieve strong returns for our clients, as we were able to do in 2005. 
Hedge Funds and Private Equity 
The considerable growth in private pools of capital — namely, hedge funds and private equity — has had an impact on all of our major business lines, and Goldman Sachs is well positioned to benefit from their continued growth. Our securities services business provides prime brokerage services, which include financing, securities lending and fund administration for many of the world’s largest hedge funds. Goldman Sachs entered this business more than 20 years ago, long before most of our competitors. Our experience and client focus have firmly established 
us as an industry leader with a formidable market share. And this is one of our fastest growing businesses. Over the last five years, our client base has doubled in size, assets have more than tripled and we have significantly 
expanded our international footprint. We believe that the hedge fund industry is still in its infancy, and we are poised to capitalize on its long-term growth. 
We were also an early entrant in the alternative asset management space and today within our asset management unit we are one of the largest managers of direct hedge fund and hedge fund of funds assets as well
as private equity portfolios of funds. At the same time, we have built a strong advisory business focused on hedge funds and private equity firms, providing them with mergers and acquisitions advice, hedging and capital market solutions. Over the last three years, Goldman Sachs has advised on more mergers and acquisitions and led more underwritings for this client base than any of our competitors. 
Our principal investments group — which, in 2005, raised an $8.5 billion corporate investment fund and
a $3.8 billion real estate fund, both, our largest ever—
has also co-invested alongside our private equity clients in recent years. In an era of increasingly large and complex transactions, the spreading of risk and sharing of expertise are essential. Many of these co-investments arise directly from our strong relationships with our private equity clients. 
Client Trust and Business Judgment 
No matter what the transaction, the litmus test for us is always the trust of our clients. If real or perceived conflicts of interest raise fundamental questions in our clients’ minds, all aspects of our business will be hurt. Strong business judgment, grounded in integrity, is at the core of everything we do. It is how we protect our reputation, deepen the trust of our clients and enhance shareholder value. In the last year, we embarked on an important initiative at Goldman Sachs, the Chairman’s Forum, which placed a great deal of emphasis on business judgment and accountability. 
Over the course of 25 sessions around the world, each lasting more than six hours, we met with approximately 1,200 managing directors in groups of 50 or so to discuss their responsibilities as leaders. Through case studies and frank dialogue, we examined our responsibilities as managers, leading by example and exercising difficult judgments through teamwork. 
In 2006, we are extending the Forum to our 7,000 vice presidents. We intend to convey to each of them that commercial success and our reputation for integrity and judgment go hand in hand. 
Our Culture and Goldman Sachs Alumni 
Our culture of excellence, teamwork and integrity defines Goldman Sachs. These shared values transcend the firm and are exemplified in our alumni. Many of these individuals become our clients, pursue lifelong interests outside the securities industry or go into public service. This last point merits particular mention. Goldman Sachs has a long tradition of public service. Many of our people have gone on to significant positions in government and the not-for- profit sector and their achievements are a source of pride for all of us. 
The Future 
In the course of Goldman Sachs’ history, the firm has developed four underlying strengths that serve us well today and will, we trust, do so in the future: (1) we have client relationships that we believe are second to none; (2) we have a track record of anticipating and adapting to client needs, market opportunities and longer term market trends; (3) we have developed best-in-class trading and
risk management capabilities; and (4) we have a culture that allows us to attract, develop, motivate and retain exceptional professionals and encourages them to work together in a real spirit of teamwork. 
Looking ahead, we see favorable conditions globally, buoyed by strong economic growth. This is particularly encouraging because, for more than a year, we have experienced rising short-term interest rates in the United States, which in the past, has often been a precursor
to a slowing economy. Nonetheless, there are clear risks: significant structural imbalances in the global economy, from the current account deficit in the United States to weak domestic demand in much of Europe and Asia;
an increased global reliance on commodities, like oil and natural gas; and a world awash in liquidity. This last condition is forcing investors to accept greater risk as they reach for returns and, as a consequence, continues to drive risk premiums to historically low levels. Finally, the fact that the global financial system is increasingly integrated and closely connected means, notwithstanding the tremendous benefits it offers, that shocks to the system have the potential to be dramatically accentuated in both speed and complexity. 
An important part of our job of managing the firm is to prepare for such risks, including those that may have a low probability of occurring, but could have significant adverse consequences for financial markets and our business. This responsibility is embedded in our risk management processes, our technology and, not least, the foresight of our people. 
Our franchise, with strong leadership positions in the United States, Europe and Asia, allows Goldman Sachs to operate at the center of the global economy. We believe that we are well situated to participate in the growth of key developing markets, particularly China, India, Russia and Brazil. Our businesses are strong client-driven franchises benefiting from positive long-term trends. While they do not lend themselves to predictable earnings on a quarterly basis, over the long term, we are committed to providing our shareholders with returns on equity at or near the top of our industry while continuing our successful record of growing book value and earnings per share. 

"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2006,"We are extraordinarily fortunate to have the opportunity to lead Goldman Sachs. Like each of our predecessors, our mandate is to preserve the legacy of the firm while remaining open to the change and innovation that best meets the needs of our clients. 
Our outlook has been shaped by our having been at Goldman Sachs for an average of more than 20 years. Each of us has been responsible for a number of different regions and businesses across the firm,
and, with the strong leadership in each of the firm’s divisions, Goldman Sachs continues to benefit from an enduring sense of continuity. All of us at the firm are stewards of a legacy forged over 138 years that puts our clients at the center of everything we do. 
These cultural attributes were at the very heart of
our performance this past year. For 2006, net revenues increased 49% to $37.7 billion and net earnings rose 70% to $9.5 billion. Diluted earnings per common share were $19.69, an increase of 76% from $11.21 for the previous year. Our return on average common shareholders’ equity was 32.8%. And as you can see in the chart to
the right, book value per common share increased 27% in the last year, and has grown from $20.94 at the end
of our first year as a public company in 1999 to $72.62, a compound annual rate of 19% over this period. At the same time, the firm returned over $7.8 billion of capital to shareholders by repurchasing 50.2 million shares of our common stock in 2006. 
While revenues grew 49% last year, our operating expenses increased 36%. As a result, our 39% pre-tax margin in 2006 was a record—allowing us to produce more earnings per dollar of net revenues than at any 
time since we went public. We also retained a greater overall percentage of earnings than in previous years, with 43.7% of revenues being paid for compensation and related expenses. 
While our business does not lend itself to predictable earnings on a quarterly basis, over the long term, we are committed to providing our shareholders with returns on equity at or near the top of our industry while continuing to grow book value and earnings per share. 
In our first letter to you, we will discuss some of the underlying strengths that helped drive our results, and how they make Goldman Sachs competitive in the face of contrasting business models, structural changes and evolving client needs. We also will highlight some of the growth opportunities we see in various markets and regions and conclude with a few brief points about managing the firm in different market environments. 
The Evolving Needs of Our Clients 
In recent years, the changing needs of our clients, technological advancements and the global integration of markets and economies have spurred structural changes
in securities markets and, in turn, across all of our businesses. 
Increasingly, clients expect firms like Goldman Sachs to commit capital on their behalf when executing transactions. This has shifted the landscape in virtually every aspect of our business. In investment banking, offering strategic advice remains at the center of what
we do. Clients frequently expect our advice to be accompanied by the provision of the capital necessary to make that advice actionable. For example, Goldman Sachs was the lead advisor to Mittal Steel in its acquisition of Arcelor. We not only provided strategic advice but also
a significant financing commitment—which was critical to the feasibility of the bid. 
In securities sales and trading, market making has always been essential to the liquidity, efficiency and stability of financial markets. Increasingly, however, our clients look to us to execute large, complex or capital-intensive transactions on their behalf. 
Our investment management clients seek advice focused on achieving the best long-term performance for their portfolios. While we must produce consistently strong results for our clients, our approach must be balanced with the right asset and risk allocation specific to each client’s needs. This requires identifying and developing innovative products and strategies that seek to optimize returns, while minimizing risk. 
Our focus on the needs of our clients has never wavered. The question for us remains, however, how Goldman Sachs can best meet those needs. 
Today, it has become almost axiomatic that firms like Goldman Sachs can be an advisor, financier and co-investor. However, we have long believed that not only can Goldman Sachs fulfill these roles, but we must do
so in order to be effective for our clients. 
Guided by this client focus, we must constantly re-examine the boundaries of our businesses and identify new opportunities. This continuous review of our strategy has led us to restructure a number of businesses to better address the needs of our clients. 
• Financing Group. We created the financing group — centralizing all financing-related advice, origination and execution within the firm. Our investment banking clients today benefit from greater connectivity within our capital markets franchise through innovative financing and risk management solutions across the equity, credit and derivatives spectrum. 
• Credit and Equity Integration. We combined the
key elements in our capital markets sales and trading operation—cash equities, credit, derivatives and convertibles—and housed them in consolidated groups so our clients’ needs are served seamlessly across the entire capital structure. 
• High-Touch and Low-Touch Trading. We recognized early on that the impact of technology and our clients’ desire to execute trades through multiple channels were going to fundamentally alter the
cash equities market. We restructured our equities business to respond to the priorities of our clients. We developed and built out electronic execution platforms that now trade approximately 500 million shares a day. At the same time, we refined our high-touch trading, facilitating complex client transactions through a combination of our execution capability and our willingness to assume market 
risk and commit capital. 
• Investing Platforms. We built out our investing platforms and more closely coordinated their activities with investment banking. We broadened our merchant banking focus to different asset classes, closing a $6.5 billion Infrastructure Fund and a $5.25 billion Mezzanine Fund in the last year. 
• Alternative Assets. As an early entrant in both the alternative asset management and prime brokerage spaces, we recognized the important role private pools of capital would play across markets. With $145 billion of alternative assets under management, Goldman Sachs is one of the largest managers of direct hedge fund and hedge fund 
of fund assets as well as private equity portfolios of funds. Our securities services business, which provides financing, securities lending, fund administration and other services for many of
the world’s largest hedge funds, has seen its client base double and balances triple in size in the
last five years. The development of these businesses has helped make us more effective advisors and investment managers. 
When we began to implement these changes, we did so
at a time when we already had a strong franchise across many of our businesses. Change, understandably, seemed unduly risky to many. 
Two hallmarks of the firm gave us the confidence
to initiate these changes. First, staying close to clients
has allowed Goldman Sachs to identify and anticipate opportunities at an early stage. Our proximity to clients allows us to understand early on what is required to meet their changing needs. And we have learned the value in being willing to embrace the risk of altering our model to supply that response. 
Today, we hold leading positions in M&A advisory and underwriting, maintain significant market share
in the equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets, and have one of the largest, best-performing investment management platforms in the world. Clients have never been more important to Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs has never been better positioned or capable of meeting the varying needs of our clients. 
The second factor that has defined our response to change is our culture. We strongly believe that the shared values embodied in our people are our most powerful competitive advantage. 
Our emphasis on teamwork is not an abstract goal, but a living, breathing reality. It allows us to complement an individual’s skills and expertise with his or her colleagues to provide exceptional client service across different parts of the firm and components
of a client’s transaction. This teamwork is ingrained
in Goldman Sachs. Our people approach their responsibilities through the lens of a partnership. They feel ownership of the entire firm, not just
of their division or region. On a daily basis, this translates into a real sense of collaboration. 
Our focus on people begins with recruiting
the right individuals one-by-one to Goldman Sachs. We then help develop their careers with regular
and specific feedback and opportunities to work in different parts of Goldman Sachs. We believe this effort has paid off with high levels of retention and deep experience across the firm, despite the intense competition for talent in our industry. 
Our industry and the firm’s work environment are fertile ground for innovation. We reward people who develop new ideas and new ways of serving our clients. Whether it is anticipating change in equity market structure, identifying opportunities in distressed investing, exploring alternative energy solutions or recognizing
the important roles private pools of capital would play, our people have searched out and been receptive to new ideas and market opportunities. 
Growth Opportunities 
While we have been fortunate in identifying and acting
on many opportunities in recent years, we see certain areas today where the firm has been uneven in its response. One area that we believe needs increased focus is our strategy in new and developing markets, particularly India, Russia, Brazil and the Middle East. 
Certainly, the strength of our franchise in China continues to benefit from our continuous involvement in the country since the early 1990s. Two years ago, we established Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Company Limited, our joint venture in China, in conjunction with the creation of a domestic securities company, Beijing Gao Hua Securities Company Limited. This unique structure gives us the ability to operate in the domestic Chinese markets. This past year, we made an important strategic investment in Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Limited (ICBC), China’s largest commercial bank. We did so through a strategic cooperation agreement in which we committed to advise ICBC on important risk management, infrastructure and business development issues. Equally critical, ICBC will help us identify new clients and opportunities in one of the most significant markets we are operating in today. 
While we believe we have a strong presence in China, we need to establish a more meaningful presence in India, Russia, Brazil and the Middle East. In India, we are establishing, through Goldman Sachs India,
a deeper investment banking and securities business. We have strong relationships with many of the largest corporations in India, but the country’s rapid growth and strong talent pool merit a much more dedicated on-the-ground presence. 
Russia, with an increasing number of companies focused on international growth, represents strong investment banking, sales and trading and private banking opportunities. We recently opened an office in Moscow and have professionals focused on serving clients in each of these divisions. 
In Brazil, we were recently granted a local foreign exchange license and are moving aggressively to build a significant sales and trading operation. At the same time, we have new leadership in place in our Investment Banking division in São Paulo and are intent on further strengthening our relationships in Brazil and across Latin America. 
In the Middle East, Goldman Sachs is opening offices in the Arabian Gulf to work more closely with our investment banking and private wealth management clients. 
We see other areas across the firm where we believe there is strong growth pwotential. These include widening our investment banking footprint to work with a broader circle of corporate clients. Many smaller companies in the so-called middle market may benefit from our strategic advice, financing know-how and capital even more than larger companies. 
We also see opportunities in advising governments and investors on the sale and purchase of public infra- structure assets like airports, shipping ports, toll roads and bridges. In the insurance sector, the management
of certain assets, such as variable annuities, allows us to extend our core competency in risk management
and our trading expertise. We also are building a private banking capability within our private wealth management business as part of our strategy to provide a full range of services to our clients. 
This past year, Goldman Sachs lost an individual who deeply embodied our culture and spirit. 
In August, John L. Weinberg, Senior Chairman and former Senior Partner, passed away. During his more than 56 years with Goldman Sachs, John built many of the firm’s most enduring client relationships and, through his leadership, helped elevate the firm’s global stature. John’s commitment to service and ideals bigger than one person infused his sense of obligation to the firm and
its culture. He was a visionary, and while this description can often be overstated, it does not do justice to the confidence he inspired, the clarity in thinking he expressed and the integrity he exhibited throughout his career. 
John was a crucial link in a virtuous cycle of people helping those they work with, caring not only about their division, but also about the firm by serving on various firmwide committees or task forces and extending that ethic to their communities and countries. 
The culture of service that John personified
has continually evolved and, today, is represented in his successors. 
Hank Paulson, who had served as Goldman Sachs’ Chairman and CEO for the last seven years, was nominated and confirmed as the United States’ 74th Secretary of the Treasury. Each of us is indebted to Hank in our own way but all of us miss his tireless passion, sage counsel and innate leadership. He led Goldman Sachs through both exhilarating and difficult times. In the wake of the bursting of the technology bubble, Hank forced 
the firm and many in the industry to ask uncomfortable questions. And he held himself to that same scrutiny. 
Like his four immediate predecessors, Hank wanted to help make a difference through government service. We are proud of him and wish him every success. In many ways, however, Hank’s decision is not unique. Our people, from those junior to those senior, are passionate about effecting change either through the firm or in their personal lives. 
This past year, we celebrated Community TeamWorks’ 10th anniversary. In that time, the people of Goldman Sachs have volunteered with over 830 community partners in 9,400 projects to help over 600,000 people in need. Every day between April
and August of each year, people across the firm come together to spend time with a child or senior, help
to build affordable housing, teach young people in schools, clean up parks or work for their communities in countless other ways. 
While the combined effect of this volunteerism is possible to quantify in numbers, it is impossible to quantify in terms of the impact it has on Goldman Sachs.
It reinforces the sense of obligation we all share not only to one another but also to the well-being of
our communities. We don’t require that any of our people participate in Community TeamWorks, but approximately 18,000 people in the firm volunteered to do so in 2006. 
We are also proud that Goldman Sachs received a public service distinction for an action that came directly out of our business. In November, the firm accepted
the Secretary of State’s Award for Corporate Excellence for the donation of 680,000 acres of ecologically precious land in Tierra del Fuego, Chile. In 2002, we purchased
a portfolio of distressed debt, which included notes secured by this environmentally significant forestland.
We determined that this unique tract of land could and should be preserved. With the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), we announced a partnership to protect much of the wilderness at the southernmost edge of South America. Through this unprecedented private/public alliance, Goldman Sachs and the WCS are working with Chilean conservationists and other partners to establish
a world-class nature reserve that preserves and protects this extraordinary land. 
Over the last two years, the firm assisted six European governments in developing the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), which came to fruition this past year. This innovative structure will provide a steady stream of immunization funds for programs in 70 developing countries by issuing debt in capital markets backed by multiyear grants from sovereign donor governments. These funds are projected to help save the lives of five million children in the next ten years. IFFIm is an important example of the power of capital markets to address some of society’s most important issues. 
This is particularly true in the area of the environment. In the last year, we have expanded our trading activities
in the carbon emissions market to include trading and investing in project-based emission reduction credits
and pricing emission risk, in addition to the trading of carbon credits. Innovative trading in these new markets can be a source of meaningful action to address global climate change. 
Lastly, given the integration of markets and economies, improvements in transportation and communication networks and the development of capital markets around the world, Goldman Sachs is well positioned to be a catalyst for financial progress, innovation and economic growth. 
We are proud to be able to work with many countries, both with developed and emerging markets, as they restructure and reform their economies and financial systems. We believe strongly that Goldman Sachs, through 
the skill and know-how of its people, is contributing to the development of vibrant and dynamic markets that can efficiently allocate capital to their most productive use. Such markets are a vital precursor to sustainable economic growth and security, as millions of people 
are experiencing the benefits of market development around the world. 
The broader business environment has been very favorable for the past several years, and thus far in 2007, the financial and economic outlook across the global economy has remained generally positive. However, we are always cognizant that conditions can change quickly and in unforeseen ways. We continually remind ourselves that the recent pace of revenue growth simply is not sustainable. As a firm that operates in the center of the global economy, we have been able to grow at a multiple of GDP growth and are directly and significantly affected by the macro- economic environment. 
It is difficult to regard 2006 as anything but an exceptional year for Goldman Sachs. One of the worst things we could do, as a firm and as individuals, is to begin to believe that the laws of economics don’t apply to us—that somehow markets aren’t cyclical. We also need to be mindful that our financial performance is very much a product of the opportunities the market environment and our clients make available to us. 
No matter the conditions, our job is to perform well relative to our competitors and the opportunities at hand. But in absolute terms, we plan for markets and conditions that won’t always be as favorable as those in recent years. We know that managing the firm in unfavorable environments is very different from managing it in good times. But two indelible mandates will remain: commitment to our clients and to our culture. 
All of us at Goldman Sachs are fortunate to work in
a dynamic industry with clients who expect and demand a great deal. There is no substitute for being held in high regard by our clients, having a clear understanding of our role in their larger success and keeping our perspective no matter the business environment. 
We are excited and proud to lead the remarkable people of Goldman Sachs, and through their talent, expertise and client focus will work to build on the firm’s strong legacy. 

"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2007,"In last year’s letter, we discussed Goldman Sachs’ performance within the context of favorable market and economic conditions. We also said that our job is to plan for markets and conditions that won’t always be as benign. 
While the first half of 2007 was largely characterized by a positive operating environment, the latter half of the year saw significant turbulence across global markets. Despite these more difficult conditions, Goldman Sachs produced very strong performance for the year because of the talent and dedication of our people, a culture of teamwork and a deep and broad client franchise. 
In 2007, net revenues increased 22 percent to $46.0 billion and net earnings rose 22 percent to $11.6 billion. Diluted earnings per common share were $24.73, an increase of 26 percent from $19.69 for the previous year. Our return on average common shareholders’ equity was
32.7 percent. The firm also returned $9 billion
of capital to shareholders by repurchasing
41 million shares of our common stock. Book value per common share increased 25 percent during 2007, and has grown from $20.94 at the end of our first year as a public company in 1999 to $90.43, a compounded annual growth rate of 20 percent over this period. 
As we have stated before, our business does not lend itself to predictable earnings. However, over the long term, we are committed to the goal of providing our shareholders with returns on equity at or near the top of our industry while continuing to grow book value and earnings per share. 
In this year’s letter, we will discuss some of the changes that financial markets are undergoing and how the firm’s institutional strengths help us to respond to these changes. In particular, we want to highlight what we believe to be the differentiating element of Goldman Sachs —our culture —and how it infuses our approach to risk management and client service. While the value of “culture” may not lend itself to empirical analysis, we know that it is the bedrock of our financial performance. 
The Credit Cycle 
During the last several years, the global economy has benefited from a number of developments.
The global integration of markets and economies, the rise of emerging markets, the growth of private pools of capital and the ability of central banks 
to combat inflation coalesced to help make capital historically cheap. 
A world awash in liquidity led to an influx of investments across different asset classes and markets. We saw significant increases in real estate prices,
for instance, and a growing role for financial sponsors in global M&A. Significant value was being created, but many were asking if a credit bubble was taking shape. 
Not surprisingly, the broad availability of credit had implications on the pricing of risk. As capital flows increased around the world, the search for excess yield drove credit spreads down to unprecedented levels. The tightness in credit spreads, extraordinarily low default rates and the run-up in housing prices 
in the U.S. and much of Europe simply were not sustainable. 
In hindsight, it seems easy to identify precisely what happened. In the day-to-day management of our business, identifying a bubble and calling its exact end is much more difficult. As the number one global adviser in M&A, we are also a significant financier of many of the largest corporate transactions. As a co-investor with our clients, we are active in private equity and real estate investing. In our mortgage business, we price assets and structure securities for institutions and other large investors. 
Our strong market share comes, in part, from the fact that we are active in these and other markets,
and because we are willing to assume risk on behalf of our clients. But, at the same time, when conditions deteriorate, losses are unavoidable. And in the course of the year, we were not immune to them. 
The Strength of our Client Franchise 
Some commentators have speculated that our overall performance was due to a few so-called smart bets to mitigate losses. The fact is that we have a diverse set of businesses and no single business or trading opportunity dictated our performance. 
What drove performance was the quality of our client franchise. To us, franchise describes the extent to which clients come to us for advice, execution and, sometimes, partnership. And through these relationships, business opportunities are made available to the firm. 
In Investment Banking, we have a broad franchise that serves corporations, financial sponsors, institutions and governments. In the last year, we advised on each of the five largest sponsor transactions. When conditions became more difficult over the summer, clients sought us out as an advisor in challenging situations they faced—for example, Countrywide, Home Depot Supply and, in connection with Northern Rock, the U.K. Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority. 
During the same period, we priced an $896 million equity offering for Apollo Management on our innovative GSTrUE platform, which we developed earlier in the year. GSTrUE pioneered the offering and trading of privately placed securities, bringing the liquidity of an exchange with the flexibility of a private placement. We are proud that GSTrUE will be integrated into The PORTAL Alliance —an industry-wide platform for the trading of unregistered securities. 
Investment Banking remains the front end of our growing franchise. This is particularly true within the context of our principal investing activity. The majority of our principal investing opportunities are sourced through our client franchise as clients seek us out as a co-investor and other principals seek us out as partners. And while retaining our leadership position in global M&A, we also launched merchant banking funds with aggregate commitments of 
$50 billion during the year. 
In our Securities businesses, we are, first and foremost, a market maker. We price assets, manage risk and execute transactions on behalf of our clients. This was particularly visible during the many tumultuous trading days during the summer. On some occasions, our U.S. shares trading platforms processed over two billion shares a day, more than double our average volume. We also experienced record customer activity in our credit, rates and currency businesses, not 
only during the summer, but for much of the year. 
In our Asset Management business, we manage $868 billion in total assets under management. In the last year alone, we attracted inflows of $161 billion. Our ability to offer clients access to a broad range of investment strategies, from active equity to private equity fund of funds, to plain vanilla fixed income and money market products has been a key differentiating factor. 
There are, however, important areas for us to continue to address. Like many others in the quantitative fund space, we have had issues with the performance of certain of our quantitative funds. We know that we disappointed our clients in those funds, and, we are focused on learning from this past year’s events. In addition, direct quantitative hedge funds represent only five percent of our assets under management, and we realize the importance of expanding our product portfolio in actively managed strategies. 
Our Stake in the Global Economy 
Each of our businesses benefits from a number of different factors or trends —from the development of products and instruments to specific market dynamics. All of our businesses, however, will continue to be positively driven by the global integration of economies and markets. 
In 2007, our pre-tax earnings outside the U.S. exceeded 50 percent for the first time. 
In a seminal research piece that coined the term “BRICs,” we identified early on the breakout potential of the high-growth countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Historically, however, we have not built much physical infrastructure in the emerging markets. That changed in the last two years as we opened offices in Mumbai, Moscow, São Paulo, Dubai, Doha and Tel Aviv. 
We are also making strategic investments in these markets. We are currently negotiating a strategic alliance in Saudi Aroabia with NCB Capital, the securities arm of National Commercial Bank, the largest bank in the Middle East. We have invested over $1 billion
in India and plan to invest more. And we have recently acquired an asset management platform
in South Korea with $7 billion in assets under management to further develop our distribution capabilities in the region. 
The next step for us is to build out our securities capabilities in these growth markets. In Brazil, we are now licensed to do onshore fixed income activities. In Russia, we have built a platform to trade both cash equity and fixed income products and select over-the-counter derivative products. 
In India, we have cash, futures and options capabilities. In China, we can trade cash products through
Gao Hua Securities Company Limited, our joint venture partner. And in South Korea, we received 
our banking license, which allows us to offer a broader range of products to our clients. We continue to see more opportunities in these and other developing markets. 
Globally, Private Wealth Management (PWM) also represents a significant opportunity for the firm, and we are determined to grow our footprint. 
While important as a revenue source in its own right, our PWM business connects us with a growing class of entrepreneurs around the world, who not only benefit from our private banking skills, but also rely upon our investment banking and securities expertise. 
We have made key management hires in PWM
and are developing onshore capabilities in China and Brazil. We are expanding our Swiss banking capabilities to grow our offshore franchise in important markets. We also have GS Bank USA, an industrial loan corporation in the U.S., and a fully operational bank in Ireland to augment our global private banking platform. 
Our strategy of being an advisor, financier and investor is proving especially effective as we expand globally. Although we are relatively new to some of these markets, we have been able to win important mandates because of the attraction of our model, the strength of our reputation and our commitment to the local region. For example, we opened offices in Dubai and Mumbai in 2007 and were #2 in announced M&A 
in both the Middle East and India. 
This is all part of a broader strategy of identifying high-growth areas around the world and building our franchise in tandem with these economies. 
Our Culture 
Our ability to perform rests on a shared passion for teamwork, integrity and excellence. Teamwork
is not an abstract goal, but a reality. It allows us to complement an individual’s skills and expertise with those of his or her colleagues to provide exceptional client service across different parts of the firm. 
Our people are also results-driven and measure their effectiveness by the successes of our clients. 
Culture is a difficult concept to define, but we believe it is what truly differentiates Goldman Sachs. 
Goldman Sachs’ partnership ethos still runs throughout the firm. This mentality creates a sense of ownership of the firm’s capital, risk and profitability
at all levels. We have over 30,000 employees, but we 
try every day to make the firm feel smaller. Whether we communicate with people divisionally, regionally or at the senior leadership level, we reinforce the same values. Each person at Goldman Sachs is a steward of our legacy and the culture it represents. 
One example of this is The Chairman’s Forum. For the past year, the three of us conducted over 30 half- day sessions in the U.S., Europe and Asia with every Managing Director (MD) to talk about his or her role in advancing our client franchise. We spent more time on this initiative than any other. Given the fact that our MDs set the tone throughout the firm, there were few more important ways to invest our time. 
The firm also imbues a sense of partnership through our compensation process. We take a comprehensive view on performance versus one limited to individual results. While individual performance matters, everyone’s pay is dependent on how Goldman Sachs performs overall. People are incentivized to act in a way that supports the firm as a whole and not to be parochial about their specific division or business unit. 
Ultimately, our success depends on the quality of the people we attract and retain. We spend enormous amounts of time on these issues. It begins with recruiting. At Goldman Sachs, everyone from our junior to our most senior people commits time
and focus to our recruiting efforts. Our Management Committee members have participated in nearly 80 recruiting events over the last year. The priority we place on recruiting is one reason why more than 80 percent of the offers we extended globally to under- graduates and graduates in 2007 were accepted. 
Once they come into the firm, our people expect ongoing training and development. Within GS University, there are over 2,400 online and classroom courses. Ninety percent of our people participated — completing 950,000 hours of training during the year. Our people also expect to have a broad range of experiences over the course of their careers. Many of us, including most of our senior leadership, have worked in multiple divisions and in multiple regions. 
Even after people leave Goldman Sachs, they still tend to identify with our firm and we foster that connection. In the last two years, we have held
15 events for alumni in the U.S., Europe and this year, Asia. Over 50 percent of our retired partners have attended at least one event and nearly 12,000 former GS professionals have registered on our alumni web site. In October 2006, we held an alumni event in London and over 1,000 people attended. 
We have a rich history and tradition, and we invest in it. Our alumni help us recruit, participate in volunteer activities and come back to speak to our people. In many cases, they are also clients of the firm. Not only does all of this help validate our culture, it provides a real, tangible value that transcends any single generation. Good people hire good people. Through this process, the feeling of ownership is passed on. Our culture is self-sustaining and self-perpetuating. 
Risk Management 
Not surprisingly, the culture of our firm anchors our approach to risk management. 
That approach is characterized by accountability, escalation and communication. A large part of this discipline is represented in the marking process, which assigns value to a position based on its currently traded market price. We believe that rigorous mark- to-market accounting for financial instruments 
is fundamental to prudent management because it facilitates a clear view of risk. It allows us to manage market risk limits, monitor exposure to credit risk and manage our liquidity requirements. Effective risk management is demanding and often difficult, but it lies at the heart of the management of a financial institution, and, we believe it is a core competence that helps define Goldman Sachs. 
We also put great value in our firmwide committees such as the Risk Committee, which monitors financial risk; the Commitments Committee, which looks at our underwriting and distribution activities; the Capital Committee, which focuses on credit extension; and the Business Practices Committee, which reviews operational and reputational risk. These committees 
create a system of checks and balances that encourage communication between people in both control and business positions and, when necessary, the speedy escalation of a potential issue. Over one-half of the members of our firmwide committees have worked 
in two or more divisions. And the average tenure at the firm of committee members is 17 years. 
More broadly, we place great importance on communication between revenue and control areas. This translates into a constant flow of risk reports, and the end result is a better understanding of the risks we are taking. 
Closely related to communication and escalation is accountability. People have to feel responsible for the decisions they make, and for the decisions their subordinates make. If we suffer a credit loss, the relevant business is not absolved of the consequences simply because the risk was approved by the Credit department. Taken together, all flow into one another: communication encourages escalation and escalation reinforces accountability. 
Because we are in the business of assuming risk on behalf of our clients, we know we will have losses from time to time. That’s why it is important to give people the confidence and support to stay committed to those businesses during difficult times. Our appetite for risk taking is central to our ability to accomplish our clients’ objectives and to be profitable. But our appetite is calibrated by balancing potential risk and reward as market conditions shift and evolve and meaningful opportunities ebb and flow. Clearly, market conditions can change abruptly. We must never forget that risk is just that—risk, with all its consequences. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
Another important part of our culture is philanthropy and service. We are proud that so many of our people support hundreds of non-profit organizations around the world, serving on the boards of educational institutions, charities and environmental organizations. Earlier this year, building on Goldman Sachs’ long tradition of philanthropy, we announced one of our most significant philanthropic initiatives to date. 
In launching Goldman Sachs Gives, a donor-advised fund, the firm’s partners agreed to commit a part of their overall compensation to charitable organizations. Individual accounts have been established within Goldman Sachs Gives for participating partners, who will recommend charitable organizations as recipients, thereby diversifying the overall philanthropy of our firm and our people. In addition, the firm made 
a separate contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. 
Through the collective generosity of our people, we expect that Goldman Sachs Gives will grow to more than $1 billion over the next few years and will become a significant source of dedicated charitable funds. This important initiative will provide a meaningful way for our people to increase their current support 
of non-profit organizations around the world. 
Looking Ahead 
Some may characterize culture and the attributes
we described above as soft issues. To us, our culture sustains our client franchise and reputation. In that sense, it is a tangible driver of our performance. 
The relative strength of our franchise can sometimes be masked by generally favorable markets. The second half of the year’s more difficult conditions, we believe, highlighted the depth and breadth of our client franchise. 
Conditions across various markets remain challenging. Our industry is a cyclical one with little predictability in the short term. As a firm that operates in the center of the global economy, we grow at a multiple of GDP growth and are directly affected by the macroeconomic environment.
It is important to remember that, given our stake in the global economy, the recent pace of earnings growth simply is not sustainable. 
However, over the longer term, we remain optimistic that secular growth trends, notably the rise of the BRICs and the evolution of markets and instruments, will play to the strengths of our businesses and allow us to grow our franchise. 
Behind the hard numbers of financial performance
is an internal set of shared values at Goldman Sachs. These values fuel a culture of teamwork and the rigor of our risk management. We will make our fair share of mistakes and we will experience losses. Guaranteed. However, we manage our business over the long term and we believe that the cultural attributes of Goldman Sachs will continue to enable us to generate strong returns for our shareholders. 

"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2008,"fellow shareholders: 
When we wrote to you last, a relatively healthy market environment in the first half of 2007 had given way to a much more challenging one, marked by significant volatility for the remainder of the year. Since that time, global financial markets have been buffeted by a series of extraordinary and tumultuous events. Most acutely this past fall, a global contagion of fear and panic choked off the arteries of finance, compounding a broader deterioration of the global economy. 
Global equity markets were down anywhere from 30% to 60% in 2008. Credit markets became virtually frozen. Several major financial institutions were either stabilized by their governments, the private sector or filed for bankruptcy. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs, over $1 trillion in credit-related losses were recorded, and nearly $30 trillion in market value was wiped out in a matter of months. 
All of us, in one way or another, have been humbled by these events. It is a truism that markets are cyclical, that years of optimism and prosperity can be quickly undone by pessimism and uncertainty. But this time, the drivers and the consequences are broader in scope and much more intense in effect. 
As we have said in our previous letters, we have always seen it as our responsibility as leaders of Goldman Sachs to ensure that the firm is prepared to deal with adverse conditions— so that we are able to mitigate the downside and, if possible, position the firm to take advantage of the opportunities presented by improving markets. While recent markets have tested our firm like few other times in our 140-year history, we are pleased to report that we not only remained profitable in 2008, but also our culture, client franchise and strategy have proven extremely resilient. 
In a very challenging environment, net revenues fell 52% to $22.2 billion and net earnings decreased 80% to $2.3 billion. Diluted earnings per common share were $4.47 and our return on average common shareholders’ equity was 4.9%. We grew book value per share during 2008 and, since our IPO, it has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 19%. 
In this year’s letter, we would like to address some of the implications of recent events for Goldman Sachs and for our industry. We will also discuss how our integrated business model, diverse revenue mix and intense focus on risk management position us favorably going forward. Finally, we will talk about how the resiliency of our culture and focus on our clients will continue to be the strongest catalysts for our long-term success. 
A History of Adaptation 
As we confront today’s challenges, we have not lost sight
of the fact that many of the most important opportunities— and successes—in Goldman Sachs’ history came about during times of stress. 
During the Asian crisis at the end of the last decade, we made several significant investments in consumer and real estate assets. After the dislocation that followed Long Term Capital Management’s problems in 1998, we increased our fixed income market share. Following the telecom and technology bubble, we built up our private equity and mezzanine investments. After the failure of Enron when capital was scarce in the power sector, we invested in power plants, resulting in recurring trading revenues as well as gains 
from restructuring power contracts. In each instance, Goldman Sachs was able to identify opportunities during times of market dislocation. 
In this same vein, we have proven our ability to adapt our own structure, time and again, to meet rapidly shifting market conditions. In the last two decades, we have taken dramatic steps to transform ourselves to best serve the needs of our clients in the face of formidable circumstances. 
When a stable capital base and increased funding diversification became necessary, we converted from a private partnership to a publicly traded company. When scale became critical, we transformed ourselves from a relatively small firm to a Fortune 100 company. When our clients demanded a more integrated approach, we realigned and grew the firm to become a comprehensive source of advice, financing and co-investment, providing clients the wherewithal to realize their goals. 
And, as markets opened up and growth accelerated around the world, we expanded from being mainly a U.S.-based firm to a truly global organization. 
In every instance, questions about our strategy were raised, but our franchise and culture emerged stronger, primarily because we never lost sight of the importance of developing and maintaining strong client relationships and responding to structural market developments. 
Bank Holding Company 
Continuing this track record of responsiveness, in 2008, we became a bank holding company (BHC). This was done to allow Goldman Sachs to address market perceptions that placed a premium on the value of oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and to be able to access a broader set of funding alternatives. 
In our decision, we saw nothing about becoming a BHC that would fundamentally detract from our core mission of 
growing our franchise as a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm. 
To this point, many bank holding companies have core competencies that focus on a particular subset of financial services, whether commercial banking, private or personal banking, trust and custodial banking, asset management or others. At Goldman Sachs, our core competencies will remain in the services and products that we have long provided to our largely institutional client base as an advisor, financier, market maker, asset manager and co-investor. 
As part of our transition to a BHC, we expanded Goldman Sachs Bank USA. At the end of 2008, it held approximately $150 billion in assets. Heading into 2009, we will look to further diversify our funding base by growing the bank’s deposits organically through our private wealth management business, third-party distribution and through the acquisition of deposits. Other creative ideas, like the innovative way we were able to increase our lending capacity in 2002 through the creation of our William Street program, are also under consideration. 
Capital Purchase Program 
Goldman Sachs received an investment of $10 billion as a participant in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program to help promote the broader stability of the financial system. This capital, combined with the $10.75 billion of capital we raised three weeks before receiving the TARP funds, gives us an even stronger balance sheet and increases our ability to extend capital to our clients and to inject liquidity across markets. We take our responsibility as a recipient of TARP capital very seriously and recognize the important role this and the other government actions play in the underlying stability of the system. 
We appreciate that the TARP funds were never intended to be permanent capital. When conditions allow, and with the support of our regulators and the U.S. Treasury, we look forward to paying back the U.S. government’s investment so that money can be used elsewhere to support our economy. 
The Deleveraging Cycle 
It is important to consider where we are in terms of the deleveraging cycle. 
We believe that the housing-led downturn has at least five distinct elements. The first was the U.S. residential mortgage crisis. We outperformed here because of our reluctance to enter the retail mortgage origination business and our active management of risk exposures. 
The next was related to the broader credit markets. Given our leading M&A franchise, we had a large number of leveraged loans. As market conditions deteriorated, we suffered losses in our loan portfolio. But, we monitored our exposure carefully and reduced it aggressively. 
The third aspect has been the pressure on global equity
markets and other assets. Since co-investment is integral to our strategy, and we mark all our assets to market, we were naturally exposed to significant market swings in equity and other asset classes. However, we manage our co-investments for the longer-term and have a track record of outperforming the market through the cycle. 
Commercial real estate is also undergoing stress as the
ability to securitize commercial real estate mortgages remains constricted and vacancy rates are increasing. While we experienced losses in our portfolio of commercial real estate assets, we have reduced our exposure to this sector over the past year. 
The next—and we hope the final phase—is the consumer credit cycle. Here, Goldman Sachs has no direct material exposures to credit cards, auto loans, home equity loans or other consumer loans. 
Diverse Global Client Franchise Businesses 
In the midst of change, certain attributes of Goldman Sachs will remain uncompromised, no matter how the marketplace evolves. Chief among these is our commitment to a balanced, well-diversified revenue stream across our global franchise, with an emphasis on recurring fee-driven businesses. 
In Investment Banking, while corporate activity levels across our core advisory and underwriting businesses declined in 2008, we retained our #1 ranking in announced global M&A. Our non-league table businesses, including private placements and rights offerings, rose significantly as a percentage of our equity underwriting revenues. And, through our roles as advisor and risk manager, we were able to provide effective risk management solutions to corporate clients. 
In our securities sales and trading businesses, despite significant weakness in the fourth quarter, we were profitable for the full year thanks, in large part, to our diverse set of global businesses. 
In Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities, our macro businesses, including currencies, interest rates and commodities generated strong, and in some cases, record net revenues, offsetting asset price pressures and related losses in credit and mortgages. Equities produced its second best annual net revenues despite the declines in global equity markets and losses in our principal strategies business. High levels of client activity drove significant opportunities across cash trading and derivatives for the year. 
Our principal investing business experienced a particularly difficult year, given the significant decline in equity values. But the quality of our portfolio has allowed us to perform better than recent equity market declines would suggest. In our real estate principal investing business, weakening fundamentals could impact valuations further in the near term. However, we are confident of our ability to outperform over the cycle. 
Our asset management business is one of our most diverse businesses, by both product offering and geography. We will continue to leverage our long-term track record and our robust distribution relationships to grow assets under management. 
Our private wealth management business presents a particularly interesting opportunity. Within this business, we continue to provide our advisors with access to the best intellectual capital Goldman Sachs has to offer. We are building this platform into a full-service wealth advisory business with private banking, trust services and wealth planning businesses. 
Securities Services has undergone significant changes over the past six months given the evolution in the hedge fund industry. We have rigorously managed this business through a very difficult year and ended up posting record results. While we expect assets under management for the industry as a whole to decline in 2009 as a result of performance issues and redemptions, prime brokerage remains core to our franchise and we are further refining our model to reflect the changed landscape. We remain a market leader and our deep client relationships, extensive securities lending capacity and advanced technology will continue to drive a solid revenue opportunity for the firm. 
Strengthening Our Balance Sheet 
A key factor contributing to our relative strength has been our focus on risk management. 
We have long believed that the only way to remove risk in its entirety—and without introducing other exposures—is through a sale. Without the commitment to sell assets throughout
the year, regardless of the fact that many market participants believed that the prices available were at distressed levels, our performance would have been materially weaker. We are also less susceptible to future losses from declining value in the same asset classes. 
During the fourth quarter alone, we reduced our balance sheet by nearly 20%. This was a broad-based reduction— and was not concentrated on liquid, lower risk assets. This reduction, combined with almost $21 billion in new capital, resulted in an over 40% decline in adjusted and gross leverage ratios. And, our Tier 1 Ratio increased from 10.8% at the end of the second quarter of 2008 to 15.6%* at the end of the year. In addition, we grew our pool of excess liquidity to an average of $111 billion during the fourth quarter. 
Given the elevated level of risk-adjusted capital, lower legacy exposures, and immaterial direct consumer exposure, we believe that we are well-positioned to deal with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. 
The Lessons from 2008 
Risk management will come to define the events of 2008 and beyond. Our firm certainly didn’t get everything right and 
*See“Financial Information—Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Equity Capital— Consolidated Capital Requirements” for further information regarding our Tier 1 Ratio. 
there are some decisions we would prefer to take back, but how we dealt with potentially large exposures, our fair value accounting discipline and the independence of our risk management function were reinforcing for the firm in 2008. 
First, we sought to ensure that our exposures weren’t outsized in the first place, and worked to reduce such exposures whenever it was possible and made sense to do so. 
Second, we have heard some argue that fair value accounting— which assigns current market values to financial assets and liabilities—is one of the major reasons for exacerbating the credit crisis. We see it differently. The proper valuation of assets and liabilities, of positions and commitments, is essential if risk is to be managed effectively. 
For Goldman Sachs, the daily marking of positions to current market prices was a key contributor to our decision to reduce risk relatively early in markets and in instruments that were deteriorating. This process can be difficult, and sometimes painful, but we believe it is a discipline that should define financial institutions. 
Lastly, we place great importance in the independence of risk and control functions. Just as important, risk managers have at least equal stature with their counterparts in producing divisions. If there is a question about a mark or a disagreement about a risk limit, the risk manager’s view prevails. 
The Strength of Our Culture 
2008 was a trying time for our people—for individuals whose careers have spanned decades and for those who joined recently and found themselves facing one of the most difficult periods in the history of our industry. 
Over the course of the year, both of us made it a point to spend more time walking the floors. Our people, junior to senior, were not hesitant to offer their insights, thoughts and ideas. Our people care deeply about the firm and exhibit a real sense of ownership. They know that clients are contending with difficult economic and financial pressures and, through it all, our people maintained a rigorous client focus. We have never been prouder to be a part of this team. 
In markets such as these, it would be easy to get locked into short-term thinking. Yet, the opposite happened. Late into the year, we announced our new class of Managing Directors and Partners. Some could have suggested that we delay our process given the significant amount of time and effort that goes into it. Instead, during the most difficult days, our people across every division and region made time to think about the next generation of leadership at Goldman Sachs. 
As in previous periods of difficulty, such times produce strong leaders. Nothing validates our culture more than identifying people who question, probe and assert their views up and down the firm. 
Moments such as these test a firm’s culture. But an ethos of teamwork, integrity, excellence and partnership continues to be the lifeblood of Goldman Sachs. 
Over the course of his career, Jon Winkelried made exceptional contributions to our firm and our culture. He ran many of our most important businesses, helped strengthen our global client franchise and mentored many of Goldman Sachs’ leaders. After 26 years at the firm, Jon has decided to retire. We thank him for his service to Goldman Sachs. 
10,000 Women 
Nothing speaks to the firm’s value system more than our global initiative 10,000 Women. In March, we announced we would commit $100 million over five years to provide a business and management education to 10,000 underserved women around the world. 
We are doing this by creating partnerships between a global network of universities and NGOs. For instance, schools are working together to establish or expand certificate programs ranging from five weeks to six months that include such courses as marketing, accounting, market research, writing a business plan, strategic planning, accessing capital and e-commerce. These innovative certificate programs are pragmatic, flexible, and shorter term, and will help open doors for thousands of women whose financial and practical circumstances would normally prevent them from receiving a traditional business education. 
By the end of 2008, the firm announced 32 academic partnerships aimed at providing training to deserving women across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and the United States. 
An example from the already established partnerships include the Wharton School of Management and the American University in Cairo creating a certificate program on leadership management skills for 500 women. Another is the University of Michigan and the School of Finance and Banking in Rwanda training 300 women in a six-month certificate in business and entrepreneurship. And, we are working with Mills College in California, which offers one of only two MBA programs 
in the country designed specifically for women, to provide full tuition and mentoring for women who have excelled academically but are not able to complete their degree without financial assistance. 
In October, the first 25 of the 10,000 Women scholars graduated from a certificate course in entrepreneurial management at the Pan African University in Lagos, Nigeria. 
As is the case with all of the 10,000 Women partnerships, the people of Goldman Sachs are serving as mentors. Through an online mentoring program, our people—often after work and on weekends—are engaging the first classes of scholarship recipients. In addition, our people are providing in-person mentoring and guest lecturing. 
Looking Ahead 
While recent troubles have more than secured their place
in history, we should not forget that there have been several formidable market dislocations in the last 100 years. As long as human emotions influence decision-making and we grapple with the inherent tension between the spirit of innovation and the comfort of stability, this won’t be the last financial crisis with which the world will have to contend. 
We recognize our obligation to the broader financial system. The financial services industry has much to do to regain
the public’s trust and to help restore stability and vitality to our financial system. Goldman Sachs is committed to playing a constructive role as policymakers consider significant regulatory reform. 
We remain intent on having a strong presence in high-growth markets around the world. While growth rates have slowed, we continue to see important opportunities in a number of emerging economies, and we believe that our on-the-ground presence and local expertise bodes well for our prospects there. 
We have cultivated an extraordinary client franchise. We have broad and deep businesses across the globe. We have proven our ability to grow across a range of different environments. And most importantly, we have recruited and retained generations of talented and dedicated people who thrive on adapting to the market, meeting challenges and producing positive results for our clients. 
The year ahead will bring with it a rapidly shifting and demanding environment. Our mandate is to grow our business through our core strengths as an advisor, financier, market maker, asset manager and co-investor. The integration of that model and strategy is a powerful and unique one. 
We believe that Goldman Sachs is well-positioned to realize the very significant near- and longer term market opportunities available and, as a result, to produce industry-leading returns for our shareholders over the cycle. 
"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2009,"When we reported to you last, 
the world’s financial system and the global economy remained in the grips of uncertainty. Our industry had been shaken to its foundation in the wake of severe volatility, a sharp deterioration in equity values and extreme illiquidity across most credit markets. Governments, regulators and market participants were forced to confront simultaneously the unwinding of several financial institutions, ensuring short-term market stability, shoring up investor confidence and enacting measures to secure the long-term viability of the global capital markets. 
 
By the end of 2009, owed in no small part to actions taken by governments to fortify the system, conditions across financial markets had improved significantly and to an extent few predicted or thought possible. Equity prices largely rebounded, credit spreads tightened and market activity was revitalized by investors seeking new opportunities, all of which imply renewed optimism, if not the beginnings of a potential recovery. 
While improving financial conditions are often a precursor to better economic ones, the economy nevertheless remains fragile. Unemployment is high, consumer spending tepid and access to credit for many smaller businesses continues to 
be elusive. The effects of unwinding leverage embedded in the system may linger for some time. As the global economy works its way to recovery, the roles that we play for our clients become even more important as companies and investors position themselves to emerge stronger following the crisis. 
The firm’s focus on staying close to our clients and helping them to navigate uncertainty and achieve their objectives is largely responsible for what proved to be a year of resiliency across our businesses and, by extension, a strong performance for Goldman Sachs. In 2009, the firm generated net revenues 
of $45.17 billion with net earnings of $13.39 billion. Diluted earnings per common share were $22.13 and our return on average common shareholders’ equity was 22.5 percent. Book value per common share increased 23 percent during 2009, and has grown from $20.94 at the end of our first year as a public company in 1999 to $117.48, a compounded annual growth rate of 19 percent over this period. 
This past year, clients came to Goldman Sachs because of our ability to integrate advice, financing, market making and investing capabilities with sophisticated risk management. Importantly, during the crisis, we were able to commit capital when market liquidity and capital were scarce. Our duty to shareholders is to protect and grow our client-focused franchise by remaining true 
to our teamwork and performance-driven culture. Our shared values have allowed us to be nimble and reactive, yet governed by prudent, long-term thinking. 
In this year’s letter, we will address some of the steps Goldman Sachs took to further strengthen our capital, liquidity and competitive position in 2009. We will discuss the firm’s client franchise and our contribution to well-functioning markets in times of distress and, on an ongoing basis, by operating at the center of global capital markets. We also will report to you on how our integrated business model, diverse revenue streams and risk management practices serve as the core of our strategy. Importantly, we will focus on how our people and culture have been and remain fundamental to the firm’s success. Finally,
we will review the regulatory reform agenda as well as certain developments that attracted considerable attention over the course of the year. 
EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES 
Looking back on 2009, it is impossible to know what would have happened to the financial system absent concerted government action around the world. Institutions were hoarding cash and were unwilling to transact with each other. This had extreme consequences for even the healthiest of financial institutions and companies. Through aggressive measures ranging from liquidity and funding facilities to direct investment programs, the government arrested the contagious fear that had engulfed the global financial system and averted more acute circumstances. We believe such efforts were absolutely critical to protecting the financial system and ensuring the continued viability of the global economy. Goldman Sachs is grateful for the indispensable 
role governments played and we recognize that our firm and our shareholders benefited from it. 
In June 2009, the firm repaid the U.S. government’s investment of $10 billion in Goldman Sachs as a participant 
in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program, which was designed to promote the broader stability of the financial system. We subsequently repurchased the warrants acquired by the U.S. Treasury in connection with that investment which, when combined with preferred dividends paid, represented an additional $1.4 billion, or an annualized 23 percent return for U.S. taxpayers. 
CONSERVATIVE FINANCIAL PROFILE 
In light of the events of the last two years, we believe it is important to highlight for our shareholders that Goldman Sachs did not and does not operate or manage our risk with any expectation of outside assistance. Given our roots as a privately- held partnership, we have always focused on maintaining a conservative financial profile and view liquidity as the single most important consideration for a financial institution. 
Having steadily increased our Global Core Excess pool of liquidity for several years, it stood at roughly $170 billion in cash or highly liquid securities, or almost 20 percent of our balance sheet at the end of 2009. Keeping this pool of liquidity is expensive, but, in our judgment, it is money well-worth spending. Leading up to 2008, we reduced our exposures even though it meant selling at prices many thought were irrational. When the crisis hit, we raised nearly $11 billion in capital—$5 billion
of preferred equity from Berkshire Hathaway and $5.75 billion 
in common equity — without any knowledge that TARP funds would be forthcoming. 
While the past two years have validated our conservative approach to liquidity and to managing our risk, they have also prompted significant change within our organization. Specifically, we have embraced new realities pertaining to regulation and ensuring that our financial strength remains in line with our commitment to the long-term stability of our franchise and the overall markets. 
We became a financial holding company, now regulated primarily by the Federal Reserve and subject to new capital and leverage tests. Since May 2008, our balance sheet has fallen by approximately one-quarter while our capital has increased by over one-half. Over 90 percent of our shareholders’ equity
is common equity. The amount of level 3—or illiquid—assets is down by 40 percent representing less than 6 percent of our total assets. In 2009, our BaselITier 1 capital ratio increased to 15 percent, well in excess of the required minimum. 
IMPORTANT ROLES WE PLAY
ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS
Maintaining a sound financial profile is vital if we are to be effective in meeting the needs of our clients. Among the
roles we play for our largely institutional client base are advisor, financier, market maker, asset manager and co-investor. 
Strategic Advice 
Our advisory business serves as our primary point of contact with our clients and is often the genesis for sourcing other opportunities to serve them. In some instances, business garnered from our long-standing investment banking relationships is captured from a financial reporting perspective in the revenues reported within other segments, particularly within our Trading and Principal Investments segment. For instance, we have been successfully building our risk management solutions business within investment banking — encapsulating our strategy 
of integrating advice, capital and risk management expertise. Since 2005, revenues from this business have grown 32 percent compounded annually. This trend is consistent with our business model and operating philosophy which are predicated on the firm functioning as an integrated whole. 
While classic advisory revenues in 2009 reached a near cyclical low, the latter half of the year yielded greater levels of strategic dialogues, reflecting an improvement in CEO confidence. Although it is difficult to predict what types of transactions or which industries will rebound most quickly, our broad and deep franchise allows Goldman Sachs to remain knowledgeable and relevant across multiple sectors, and poised to serve our clients. Over the past five years, Investment Banking has advised over 1,000 clients in 67 countries, solidifying our leading market share position and allowing us to retain industry-leading positions in cross-border, acquirer, target and strategic defense advisory league tables. 
Financing for Growth 
Our investment banking relationships are also the basis for most of our financing mandates. As a financial intermediary, Goldman Sachs acts to match the capital
of our investing clients with the needs of our corporate
and government clients, who rely on financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver the products and services that drive economic development. Since the beginning of 2007, we have underwritten over $750 billion in corporate debt and over $450 billion in equity and equity-related products across approximately 1,900 offerings for 
800 clients globally.
We have a long history of helping states and municipalities 
access the capital markets. Since entering the public finance business in 1951, Goldman Sachs has been one of the most significant industry participants and over the past decade has helped states and municipalities raise over $250 billion in capital. In 2009, we were the number one underwriter 
for the Build America Bond program, which allows states and municipalities to meet their borrowing needs and invest in infrastructure projects. We also helped finance over $28 billion for nonprofit institutions including education services, healthcare and government entities. 
Market Intermediary 
Through our role as a market maker, we commit and deploy our capital to ensure that buyers and sellers can complete their transactions, contributing to the liquidity, efficiency and stability of financial markets. Throughout the crisis, we made prices when markets were volatile and illiquid and extended 
credit when credit was scarce. Fixed Income, Commodities and Currencies (FICC) and Equities, our market intermediation businesses that comprise our Securities Division, were meaningful drivers of our strong firmwide performance last year. 
By remaining close to our clients, we were able to direct our human and financial capital to those businesses within our market making franchise that most reflected clients’ interests and needs. Another important component of growth has been the dynamic that, as clients grow in size, the scope of the business that they execute with the firm also increases.
In 2009, 2,500 of our clients were active across both Equities and FICC products, which is up 25 percent from 2006. 
Client-Driven Risk Exposures 
Given concern by some over the nature and level of risk that financial institutions undertake, it is important to note that for Goldman Sachs, the vast majority of the risk we take and the revenues we generate is derived from trades that advance a client need or objective. 
By way of example, in 2009, an energy consumer asked us to help protect it against a rise in the cost of fuel, concerned that an increase would affect its ability to grow. To accomplish this, Goldman Sachs structured a long-term collateralized hedge facility. We then entered into hedges to offset the fuel price risk that we had assumed. As part of our normal accounting and risk management, we regularly revalue the amount of collateral necessary to be posted when fuel prices declined during
the life of the transaction. We also routinely hedge our client counterparty risk in addition to receiving collateral. In the end, we were able to structure the transaction at a fair price for
our client and generate an attractive risk-adjusted return for the firm and our shareholders. This is representative of the risk we assume and manage daily to allow our clients to focus on their underlying businesses. 
Co-Investing 
Co-investing is another way we directly align the firm’s interests with those of our clients. Two-thirds of our corporate investing opportunities are sourced from our investment banking relationships. In addition, the vast majority of money committed to our investing funds comes from our clients, who seek 
to partner with us. While returns fluctuate based on equity market performance and other factors, our merchant banking businesses have provided much needed capital to our investment banking clients and achieved strong returns for our investors and shareholders over the long term. This business 
generates management fees as well as incentive fees based on the funds’ performance. As a result, our merchant banking business helps diversify the firm’s revenues. 
The focus of our funds spans the capital structure, including senior debt, mezzanine and private equity funds. During periods of 2009 when public market liquidity dried up, our senior loan and mezzanine funds, in particular, extended needed capital
to a variety of companies whose growth opportunities would otherwise have been limited. 
There also is significant diversity within the funds themselves. Our corporate equity fund portfolio represents eight different industry groups with no one industry contributing more
than 25 percent. Looking ahead, we remain well-positioned, together with our clients, to invest in attractively priced assets. 
Managing Assets 
Managing our clients’ assets remains an important growth opportunity for Goldman Sachs and we continue to allocate significant time and resources to building our asset management businesses within our Investment Management Division 
and expanding our portfolio management capabilities. At the time of our IPO in 1999, our goal was to double assets under management (AUM) over five years. We were successful, and by May 2008, we had doubled AUM once again. Our success follows a track record of strong investment returns for our clients. 
As with all of our businesses, our client base is diverse, numbering 2,000 institutional clients and third-party distributors, and over 25,000 private wealth management accounts. Our range of products across money markets, fixed income, equity and alternative investments is offered through distribution channels to institutional, high-net-worth clients and third-party retail clients around the world. 
To advance our strategy, in 2009, we doubled our third-party distribution sales force and significantly increased our institutional and private wealth management coverage. Included in our expanded coverage focus are government sponsored organizations, corporate pension funds, insurance companies and growth markets such as Brazil, the Middle East and China. 
INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH 
BRICs and Emerging Markets 
We continue to believe that this will be the century of the BRICs and other high growth markets. They have helped lead the global recovery and, in our minds, are even more compelling now. As a result, the emerging markets remain integral to our growth strategy. 
At the beginning of the crisis, many wondered if or to what extent the BRICs and other growth markets would be able to decouple from the more established economies. Such
a decoupling had little precedent. Today, it appears that the growth markets are helping lead the recovery in the global 
economy. They continue to attract capital from abroad and, also, are making significant, long-term investments to position themselves for the future. 
We believe Goldman Sachs is similarly well-positioned to expand our franchise in step with these countries’ growth. We remain focused on implementing a familiar strategy— expand our advisory client coverage, build underwriting capabilities, develop sales and trading expertise and grow our wealth management business. 
Investing in People and Communities 
While Goldman Sachs serves a wide range of clients with individual needs and goals, we also believe that financial institutions have a larger obligation to the financial system, the broader economy and the communities in which their employees work and live. For us, this means helping new enterprises succeed and grow, catalyzing economic development and financing community projects that create a better quality of life for more people. Given that our firm is most successful when economies and markets thrive, this is in our interest and that of our shareholders. 
The firm’s Urban Investment Group is helping to create thousands of affordable housing units and funding businesses in underserved communities, helping to bring together money and innovative ideas to revitalize cities across the United States. By making investments, loans and grants, and through service initiatives, we are working to transform distressed neighborhoods into vibrant and sustainable places of opportunity. As one example, with a $61 million investment in the New York Equity Fund, Goldman Sachs is providing 569 units of much-needed affordable housing for low-income New Yorkers as part of
a wider effort to rehabilitate 47 buildings across Harlem, the South Bronx and Brooklyn. 
We are pleased to report that our10,000 Women initiative, which we introduced to you in last year’s shareholders letter, has exceeded our own expectations and is today providing underserved female entrepreneurs with a business education through partnerships with more than 70 academic institutions and nonprofits in 20 countries, including India, Brazil, China, Afghanistan, Rwanda and the United States. Our early experience is confirming research by the World Bank, Goldman Sachs and the United Nations that educating women can lead to real economic growth and healthier, safer and better-educated communities. 
10,000 Small Businesses 
Based on the results of 10,000 Women, Goldman Sachs announced in 2009 a new effort called 10,000 Small Businesses. 
This $500 million, five-year program aims to unlock the growth and job-creation potential of 10,000 businesses across the United States through greater access to business education, mentors and networks, and financial capital. It is based on 
the broadly held view of leading experts that a combination of education, capital and support services best addresses the barriers to growth for small businesses. 
The program’s business and management curriculum is supported by a $200 million commitment to community colleges and universities to build educational capacity and to provide scholarships to underserved small business owners. Goldman Sachs has committed $300 million through 
a mix of lending and philanthropic support to Community Development Financial Institutions to help get capital
flowing to small businesses. The program’s critical support services will connect small business owners with mentoring, networking and advice available through our various 10,000 Small Businesses partners. 
As with 10,000 Women, the people of Goldman Sachs will give freely of their time and professional skills to serve as mentors and guest lecturers, as well as to participate on selection committees. We believe this approach is in keeping with the best tradition of our firm, aligning our philanthropic and growth development efforts with our core competencies and expertise. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
We also announced a $500 million philanthropic contribution to the firm’s donor-advised fund, Goldman Sachs Gives, which was established in 2007. The firm’s compensation for partners was reduced to fund this charitable contribution, reflecting the firm’s tradition of philanthropy. 
We have asked our partners to recommend charitable organizations that focus on the critical areas of creating jobs and economic growth, building and stabilizing communities, honoring service and veterans and increasing educational opportunities. 
OUR PEOPLE 
While an often used phrase, it is true in every way at Goldman Sachs: Our people are our most important asset. We do not have material “property, plant and equipment” assets. Rather, we have talented, entrepreneurial professionals who are dedicated to the firm’s mission of supporting economic growth. In 2009, our people sat
on 1,500 nonprofit boards, and 23,000 of us volunteered for over 800 local nonprofits through our Community TeamWorks program. In short, our people are central to who we are, to the cohesiveness of our culture, and to our ability to generate attractive returns for shareholders. 
Throughout 2009, we stayed true to our focus on people. Every member of our management committee participated in on-campus recruiting, while another 120,000 recruiting hours were undertaken by people across the firm. Through GS University, we provided 350,000 hours of training and leveraged our senior leaders as faculty to provide learning opportunities to our people more broadly. Last year,
for example, over 5,000 courses were taught by the firm’s managing directors and vice presidents. 
As demonstrated in the way we source opportunities and serve our clients, Goldman Sachs operates with a one-firm philosophy. Our people are rewarded for their accomplishments by how they work and succeed in teams, with the long-term interests of the organization always coming before those of the individual. We believe this partnership ethos, which reflects the firm’s long-standing business principles, is a competitive advantage that drives the company’s overall performance. 
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE 
Providing the best advice and execution to our clients means,
in turn, providing our people with attractive career opportunities and long-term incentives. We have not been blind to the attention on our industry and, in particular, on Goldman Sachs, with respect to compensation. We have adopted very specific compensation principles, which we presented at our 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to ensure an even stronger relationship between pay and performance. 
These principles are designed to:
• Encourage a real sense of teamwork and communication, 
binding individual short-term interests to the institution’s 
long-term interests;
• Evaluate performance on a multi-year basis;
• Discourage excessive or concentrated risk taking; • Allow us to attract and retain proven talent; and
• Align aggregate compensation for the firm with 
performance over the cycle.
Consistent with our principles, in December, we announced 
that for 2009 the firm’s entire management committee would receive 100 percent of their discretionary compensation in
the form of Shares at Risk which have a five-year period during which an enhanced recapture provision will permit the firm 
to recapture the shares in cases where an employee engaged in materially improper risk analysis or failed sufficiently to raise concerns about risks. 
Enhancing our recapture provision is intended to ensure that our employees are accountable for the future impact of their decisions, to reinforce the importance of risk controls to the firm and to make clear that our compensation practices do not reward taking excessive risk. 
The enhanced recapture rights build off an existing clawback mechanism that goes well beyond employee acts of fraud or malfeasance and includes conduct that is detrimental to the firm, including conduct resulting in a material restatement of the financial statements or material financial harm to the firm or one of its business units. 
In addition, our shareholders will have an advisory vote on the firm’s compensation principles and the compensation of its named executive officers at the firm’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders in May 2010. 
Finally, Goldman Sachs does not set aside an actual pool
for discretionary compensation or “bonuses” during the course 
of the year. We accrue an estimate of compensation expenses each of the first three quarters. Only at year end, with the visibility of our full-year performance, do we make final decisions on compensation. While the previous quarters’ accruals attract much attention, our full-year compensation and benefits to net revenues ratio ultimately represents the firm’s compensation expense. In 2009, that ratio was the lowest ever since we became a public company — 35.8 percent. 
While 2009 total net revenues are only 2 percent less than the record net revenues that we posted in 2007, total compensation and benefit expense is 20 percent lower than in 2007, equating to a nearly $4 billion difference in compensation and benefits expense between the two periods. Our approach to compensation reflected the extraordinary events of 2009. 
REGULATORY REFORM 
Goldman Sachs has pledged to remain a constructive voice and participant in the process of reform, and has been forthcoming in recognizing lessons learned and mistakes made. We have provided a number of recommendations concerning how large financial institutions should account for their assets, how risk management processes can be enhanced, and how new regulations can keep pace with innovation. 
Given that much of the financial contagion was fueled by uncertainty about counterparties’ balance sheets, we support measures that would require higher capital and liquidity levels, as well as the use of clearinghouses for standardized derivative transactions. More broadly, we support proposals that would improve transparency for investors and regulators and reduce systemic risk, including fair value accounting. In short, we believe that sensible and significant reforms that do not impair entrepreneurship or innovation, but make markets more efficient and safer, are in everyone’s best interest. 
During our history, our firm has demonstrated an ability to quickly and effectively adapt to regulatory change. As an institution that interacts with thousands of entities, we benefit from the general elevation of standards, and will continue to work towards meaningful changes that improve our financial system. 
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AIG 
Over the last year, there has been a lot of focus on Goldman Sachs’ relationship with AIG, particularly our credit exposure to the company and the direct effect the U.S. government’s decision to support AIG had or didn’t have on our firm. Here are the facts: 
Since the mid-1990s, Goldman Sachs has had a trading relationship with AIG. Our business with them spanned a number of their entities, including many of their insurance subsidiaries. And it included multiple activities, such as stock lending, foreign exchange, fixed income, futures and mortgage trading. 
AIG was a AAA-rated company, one of the largest and considered one of the most sophisticated trading counterparts in 
the world. We established credit terms with them commensurate with those extended to other major counterparts, including
a willingness to do substantial trading volumes but subject to collateral arrangements that were tightly managed. 
As we do with most other counterparty relationships, we limited our overall credit exposure to AIG through a combination of collateral and market hedges in order to protect ourselves against the potential inability of AIG to make good on its commitments. 
We established a pre-determined hedging program, which provided that if aggregate exposure moved above a certain threshold, credit default swaps (CDS) and other credit hedges would be obtained. This hedging was designed to keep our overall risk to manageable levels. 
As part of our trading with AIG, we purchased from them protection on super-senior collateralized debt obligation (CDO) risk. This protection was designed to hedge equivalent transactions executed with clients taking the other side of the same trades. In so doing, we served as an intermediary in assisting our clients to express a defined view on the market. 
The net risk we were exposed to was consistent with our role as a market intermediary rather than a proprietary market participant. 
In July 2007, as the market deteriorated, we began to significantly mark down the value of our super-senior CDO positions. Our rigorous commitment to fair value accounting, coupled with our daily transactions as a market maker in these securities, prompted us to reduce our valuations on a real-time basis which we believe we did earlier than other institutions. This resulted in collateral disputes with AIG. We believe that subsequent events in the housing market proved our marks 
to be correct—they reflected the realistic values markets were placing on these securities. 
Over the ensuing weeks and months, we continued to make collateral calls, which were based on market values, consistent with our agreements with AIG. While we collected collateral, there still remained gaps between what we received and what we believed we were owed. These gaps were hedged in full by the purchase of CDS and other risk mitigants from third parties, such that we had no material residual risk if AIG defaulted on its obligations to us. 
In mid-September 2008, prior to the government’s action to save AIG, a majority of Goldman Sachs’ exposure to AIG was collateralized and the rest was covered through various risk mitigants. Our total exposure on the securities on which we bought protection was roughly $10 billion. Against this, we held roughly $7.5 billion in collateral. The remainder was fully covered through hedges we purchased, primarily through CDS for which we received collateral from our market counterparties. Thus, if AIG had failed, we would have had the collateral from AIG and the proceeds from the CDS protection we purchased and, therefore, would not have incurred any material economic loss. 
In this regard, a list of AIG’s cash flows to counterparties indicates little about each bank’s credit exposure to the company. 
The figure of $12.9 billion that AIG paid to Goldman Sachs post the government’s decision to support AIG is made up as follows: 
•	$4.8 billion for highly marketable U.S. Government Agency securities that AIG had pledged to us in return for a loan of $4.8 billion. They gave us the cash, we gave them back the securities. If AIG hadn’t repaid the loan, we would simply have sold the securities and received the $4.8 billion of value in that way. 
•	An additional $2.5 billion that AIG owed us in collateral from September 16, 2008 (just after the government’s action) through December 31, 2008. This represented the additional collateral that was called as markets continued to deteriorate and was consistent with the existing agreements that we had with AIG. 
•	$5.6 billion associated with a financing entity called Maiden Lane III, which was established in mid-November 2008 by the Federal Reserve to purchase the securities underlying certain CDS contracts and to cancel those contracts between AIG and its counterparties. The Federal Reserve required that the counterparties deliver the cash bonds to Maiden Lane III in order to settle 
the CDS contracts and avoid any further collateral calls. Consequently, the cash flow of $5.6 billion between Maiden Lane III and Goldman Sachs reflected the Federal Reserve paying Goldman Sachs the face value of the securities (approximately $14 billion) less the collateral (approximately $8.4 billion) we already held on those securities. Goldman Sachs then spent the vast majority of the money we received to buy the cash bonds from our counterparties in order to complete the settlement as required by the Federal Reserve. 
While our direct economic exposure to AIG was minimal, the financial markets, and, as a result, Goldman Sachs and every other financial institution and company, benefited from the continued viability of AIG. Although it is difficult to determine what the exact systemic implications would have been had AIG failed, it would have been extremely disruptive to the world’s already turbulent financial markets. 
OUR ACTIVITIES IN THE
MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION MARKET
Another issue that has attracted attention and speculation has been how we managed the risk we assumed as a market maker and underwriter in the mortgage securitization market. Again, we want to provide you with the facts. 
As a market maker, we execute a variety of transactions each day with clients and other market participants, buying and selling financial instruments, which may result in long
or short risk exposures to thousands of different instruments at any given time. This does not mean that we know or even think that prices will fall every time we sell or are short, or rise when we buy or are long. 
In these cases, we "
"re exec""",,,,
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2010,"Fellow Shareholders: 
2010 was a period of strong performance for
Goldman Sachs in the context of a challenging year.
We contended with uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy, questions about the future of regulation and significant scrutiny of our industry and Goldman Sachs. Despite these considerable challenges, our results were driven by two related and critical factors: (1) our clients, who turned to Goldman Sachs for advice and execution across a broad set of global businesses and (2) the focused commitment and dedication of our people to serving our clients’ needs and to strengthening our culture of teamwork and excellence. 
For 2010, the firm generated net revenues of
$39.2 billion with net earnings of $8.4 billion. Diluted earnings per common share were $13.18 and our return on average common shareholders’ equity was 13.1 percent, excluding the U.K. bank payroll tax, the SEC settlement and the impairment of our New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker rights. Book value per common share increased 10 percent during 2010, and has grown from $20.94 at the end of our first year as a public company in 1999 to $128.72,
a compounded annual growth rate of 18 percent over this period. 
The Business Standards Committee 
When we wrote to you last year, few would have predicted what the firm would experience and have to work through in 2010. The SEC charge, a high-profile congressional hearing and extraordinary press attention punctuated a period of scrutiny and criticism. Having faced those challenges, we also believe that few would have predicted that Goldman Sachs would execute for our clients and otherwise perform like we have. We want to thank our shareholders for believing in Goldman Sachs, our clients for supporting us and our people for their steadfastness and teamwork. 
Still, we have heard the criticisms loudly and clearly. At the very least, we must have presented ourselves in a way that made us susceptible to being criticized. And,
as the year progressed, it became increasingly clear that there was a disconnect between how we as a firm viewed ourselves and how the broader public perceived our role and activities in the market. We recognized this as an opportunity to initiate a process of introspection and thorough self-assessment to consider how we can
and should improve. 
Through the Business Standards Committee (BSC), we examined what we do and how we do it. As
part of this process, we drew on the important input of more than 200 clients who were surveyed through non-attributable, in-depth, in-person discussions conducted by an independent consulting firm. 
We made recommendations for change spanning client service, conflicts and business selection, structured products, transparency and disclosure, committee governance and training and professional development. 
One particular area of interest for our shareholders has been the changes we made in our financial reporting and disclosure. First, we reorganized our reporting segments to provide greater clarity and visibility on the critical importance of our client franchise and client facilitation to our results. Second, we are supplementing our balance sheet with a more simplified presentation that generally allocates assets to our businesses and shows the firm’s excess liquidity position. Third, we are describing in greater detail our overall risk management structure, culture and processes. And, lastly, we are providing additional disclosure related to credit risk, operational risk and capital adequacy. 
More generally, we also have increased our engagement with a broad range of constituencies to communicate the roles we play on behalf of our clients and services we provide to support economic growth and opportunity. 
When we look back on 2010, we believe that what will have the most important and lasting impact on Goldman Sachs and what we will be most proud of is the work of the Business Standards Committee and what it represents—a fundamental re-commitment to our clients; a re-commitment to reputational excellence associated with everything the firm does; a re-commitment to transparency of our business performance and risk management practices; a re-commitment to strong, accountable processes that re-emphasize the importance of appropriate behavior and doing the right thing; and a re-commitment to making Goldman Sachs a better institution. 
In the life of every institution, there are important moments in which its mission and processes can and should be re-invigorated. To this end, we know our people are already acting on the BSC’s recommendations and embracing their spirit. 
The work of the BSC and the priority on having the highest quality business standards and practices are a powerful basis from which we are able to focus on the future—to identify the opportunities where we can most effectively serve our clients and use our skills and experience to support our mission of allocating capital 
in order to fund growth and innovation. 
As we write to you in early 2011, the global economy appears to be improving—recovery is beginning to take hold. While economies continue to face a number of challenges, especially in the labor market, we are seeing client activity across our businesses picking up. Many of the CEOs we advise around the world are expressing greater confidence in the rate of future growth and 
are more oriented to making capital expenditures and other investments. 
Goldman Sachs plays important roles as an advisor and financier to help companies raise capital to grow existing businesses and invest in new ones. These roles are part of a process that is at the heart of stimulating economic growth and stability. 
Additionally, as a market maker and risk manager, we help governments, corporations and investing institutions buy and sell financial instruments in order to realize their investment objectives. As an asset manager, we help companies, pension funds, mutual funds, individual investors and others preserve and grow their financial assets. 
In many respects, our job is to match the capital of our investing clients — who aim to grow the savings of millions of people — with the needs of our corporate and government clients — who rely on financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver products and services. On either side of this equation, we often will assume and manage risks from our clients so that they can concentrate on their underlying businesses. 
Economies need strong, healthy financial institutions to do their critical part to help spur growth and innovation. Goldman Sachs is ready to support and help galvanize capital raising, investment, strategic planning and, more broadly, economic activity. 
Trends, Growth and Opportunities 
The global economy, financial markets and the financial services industry continue to deal with the significant effects of the financial crisis. However, we believe it is important to recognize the structural trends that remain unshaken and consider how Goldman Sachs is positioned so that it can continue to meet our goal of generating industry leading returns. While the nature of our business does not lend itself to predictable earnings on a quarterly basis, over the long term, we remain committed to providing our shareholders with returns on equity at or near the top of our industry while continuing to grow book value and earnings per share. 
Goldman Sachs’ ability to address and tap into important economic and financial trends through our roles as advisor, financier, market maker and asset manager will be critical to fulfilling our mission to help spur growth and perform strongly as a firm. 
These continuing trends include technological advancement, certain macro-economic and demographic developments and the rise of the BRICs and other growth markets. There has also been a necessary and important focus on regulation, which will affect the industry. At this point, however, it is impossible to say
to what extent with any degree of precision. 
We believe the core and durable elements of these trends are beneficial and play to the strengths of our firm. In the case of financial regulation, for example, institutions will be required to hold more, high-quality capital, and we are well-positioned in that regard. In considering the rise of the BRICs, rapid income growth and development will power the expansion of the global capital markets. Our strengths — responding to change nimbly, making long-term investments in our global franchise and attracting and retaining talented people — give us the best foundation from which we can position the firm to realize the opportunities that will ultimately emerge. 
Regulation 
The Dodd-Frank legislation and new capital and liquidity requirements under Basel 3 are two of the more significant outcomes from the recent focus on enhancing financial stability. Given regulatory implementation is only just beginning, we don’t yet know in detail how the new rules will ultimately impact the industry. The broad contours of new regulation, however, are clear: improve the safety and soundness of the global financial system, increase the transparency of derivatives markets, limit certain investing activities and reduce the consequences of a failure of a large financial institution. 
In terms of the safety and soundness of the financial system, Basel 3 guidelines have focused on bolstering the capital and liquidity profiles of financial institutions to better respond to shocks. With the global shift towards higher levels of capital and liquidity, we believe our conservative financial profile leaves us well positioned to meet new regulatory requirements. We have significantly bolstered our Basel 1 Tier 1 common ratio over the
past two years through earnings and capital raises. Over 90 percent of our total shareholders’ equity is in the form of common equity. 
We also continue to maintain a very liquid balance sheet, with our global liquidity pool during 2010 averaging $168 billion or nearly 20 percent of our total assets. While the Basel Liquidity Coverage Ratio has yet to be finalized, we believe we are comfortably in excess of its minimum requirements. We will take advantage
of our strong position to continue to invest in long-term growth opportunities and return excess capital to shareholders as appropriate. 
As part of reducing systemic risk relating to the trading of OTC derivatives, there has been a lot of
focus on central clearing platforms. We have long been supportive of central clearing because we believe it will improve the safety of the system by reducing counterparty risk — running more derivatives exposures through
the risk management and multilateral netting of
clearing houses will reduce the risk of firms being too interconnected to fail. This also will contribute to greater transparency, particularly for regulators. 
While we believe that central clearing platforms
are very important, it is equally important that they be well-run, with the right risk management, governance and regulatory oversight. A central clearing house
may reduce counterparty risk; it certainly will not eliminate it. In fact, because clearing houses represent
a concentration of financial activity, they may become an even greater locus for systemic risk if not managed well—exacerbating a problem they were meant to solve. And, in the end, it is the capital of clearing members that ultimately underpins the strength of the clearing house. 
In terms of activity restrictions, the Volcker Rule will restrict proprietary trading activities and many fund investments. These businesses, historically, have not been a substantial driver of the firm’s performance. In response to the new rule, we have already liquidated substantially all of the positions that had been held within Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies, our long/ short proprietary trading desk, and we have commenced the liquidation of the positions that had been held by our Global Macro Proprietary Trading Desk, which traded in the fixed income markets. 
As regulators move to implement the Volcker Rule, it will be important that market making — buying
and selling on behalf of our clients — is not materially impacted. If activities essential to market making were to be viewed as proprietary and impermissible, then financial intermediaries will be unable to commit their capital, which, at best, would reduce market liquidity and increase the costs of transactions. 
With respect to our merchant bank, its core activity — investing for clients — will continue to be integral to our overall strategy. As an investment bank, we are asked
by our clients to be an advisor, financier and supplier of equity, mezzanine and debt capital. We can still meet 
this client need with investment funds under the Volcker Rule, but with less of our own money invested. 
Technology 
A second critical trend is technological innovation, which has had a lasting impact on the structure and efficiency of global capital markets. In short, technology is a core part of our product offering and client experience. Our ability to respond quickly and effectively to address our clients’ needs with customized systems, products and services helps differentiate the firm. 
With that in mind, it is difficult to overstate the importance of investing in this area. Technology is
our largest division with over 8,000 people, more than double the size it was in 2000. 
While there is significant uncertainty over how new regulation will impact individual businesses or market structure more broadly, what is certain is that technology will play a central role. As such, we will continue to focus on building off our best-in-class systems and accelerating the transition of certain businesses to either more high-touch or low-touch operating models. 
A particular technological competitive advantage for Goldman Sachs is that we have only one central risk system, which is partially a byproduct of not having done multiple, major acquisitions that often require merging and retrofitting platforms. 
Regulation of the OTC derivatives market will drive greater transparency and automation. Conventional wisdom suggests that greater transparency pressures margins and reduces profitability. While transparency can reduce margins, it also introduces new opportunities in the form of greater client participation and product innovation. Both of these trends ultimately drive increased volumes and revenues. 
Realizing that no two markets evolve in exactly
the same way, we can draw parallels between the current OTC derivative markets and our past experiences
in both Equities and Foreign Exchange. In the equity markets, a series of events began in the late 1990s with changes to NASDAQ order handling rules, followed
by decimalization in 2000 and improvements to price execution and discovery in 2005. 
Over time, commission rates and spreads declined and volumes rose significantly. We invested in technology to drive operating efficiencies and generate market share gains. At the same time, our Equities headcount declined from peak levels of nearly 5,000 during the tech bubble to roughly 2,500 today. In addition, opportunities for new product innovation and tailored hedging solutions for clients are often a function of lower transaction
costs for the underlying instruments. 
We saw similar trends in our FX business, where today 98 percent of interdealer spot FX is traded electronically across a diverse set of execution venues. And, over the past five years, our G10 franchise volumes have doubled and revenues have increased nearly 
70 percent, while headcount is largely flat. As a result, pre-tax margins are more than one and one-half
times higher. 
Economic and Demographic Trends 
Despite the significant upheavals caused by the financial crisis, the expansion of the global economy continues. Our research estimates that Global GDP will grow by four percent per annum over the next 10 years, principally driven by growth markets. The trend of urbanization also continues, for example, with 400 million people projected to move into Chinese urban centers by 2050. A growing global middle class will likely result in an increasing demand for commodities. Not surprisingly, there has been a significant expansion of commodity rich economies like the Middle East and Russia. 
In developed economies, like Japan, aging populations will continue to increase the level of pension assets.
In addition, pools of capital in sovereign wealth funds in both developed and emerging economies are expected
to grow from $3 trillion to $10 trillion of assets in
the next decade. These concentrated pools of capital will drive business opportunities for Goldman Sachs. 
The Growth Markets 
We view the BRICs and other growth markets as one
of the most significant opportunities for our global franchise. If one thinks back to the sentiment right after the worst of the financial crisis passed, many commentators began to wonder if investors had put too much faith in the ability of growth markets, including China, to withstand particularly difficult economic conditions. In fact, some growth markets started to see significant outflows of capital. 
Today, it is clear that the BRICs and other growth economies are anchors for the global economy. As tumultuous and significant as the financial crisis was, we continue to believe that this will be the century of the BRICs and other growth markets. If anything, our view of the BRICs was validated by how well they performed during the financial crisis. 
Over the last few years, we’ve generated roughly
50 percent of our revenues from the Americas, 30 percent from Europe, and 20 percent from Asia. We believe this revenue mix positions Goldman Sachs as one of the most diverse of our U.S. peers. Another way to look at our revenue composition is to differentiate between “developed markets” such as the U.S. and Continental Europe, and “growth markets” such as China and Brazil. While reflecting a higher contribution from growth markets in recent years, revenues in the growth markets since 2006 have represented 12 percent of total firmwide revenues — with much more room to grow. 
We believe that both GDP growth and the relative fiscal stability of many growth countries are trends that should drive revenue opportunities across all of our businesses. In China and India, income growth and rapid urbanization will drive significant infrastructure demand. This projected investment exceeds $4 trillion in the next decade, and much of it can be financed domestically. Companies in growth markets are also becoming more relevant global players. In China, for instance, the volume of cross-border deals has grown more than five times since 2005. 
In addition, we’ve seen an extraordinary increase in debt and equity underwriting volumes from growth markets in the past 10 years as clients seek out financing solutions to support their growth. Over the past five years, we’ve seen nearly three times the number of capital raisings in India than we saw in the previous 10. 
The need to fund growth in China has also created an extremely active local equity market. Total market capitalization of Chinese companies has grown at a compound annual rate of 33 percent from 2002 through 2010, and its global share is expected to more than double to 28 percent over the next 20 years. There are almost as many Asian companies with one billion dollar plus market capitalization as there are such companies in the U.S. and Europe combined. 
Stable and growing capital markets also drive opportunities for our market making businesses. In Latin America, the number of our trading clients has increased nearly 25 times over the last 10 years. 
Finally, growth markets contain large and growing pools of capital. Two hundred of the largest institutions in Asia excluding Japan manage $14 trillion of assets, but only 15 percent are current Goldman Sachs clients. Growth markets also present important opportunities for our private wealth management business. In
Latin America alone there are over 10,000 families with investable assets in excess of $30 million. 
Similar to developed markets, our success in growth markets has been contingent upon our ability to attract and retain strong talent. Since 2003, our headcount
in growth markets has increased by a compound annual growth rate of 32 percent, while our firmwide headcount has grown by only seven percent. Nearly 7,000 people, or roughly 20 percent of our headcount, are domiciled in growth markets. 
In 2010, we recruited from 120 universities in growth markets, and 15 percent of 2010 new hires are from these economies versus eight percent just five years ago. We are gratified that Goldman Sachs continues
to be an employer of choice in these markets and around the world. Globally, in 2010, nearly 90 percent of the full-time undergraduates and graduates as
well as summer recruits who received an offer from Goldman Sachs accepted that offer. 
Corporate Engagement 
Finally, we are pleased to report significant progress
over the course of 2010 across our strategic, public engagement initiatives. Taken together, these initiatives represent one of the largest corporate philanthropic programs ever. Size, however, is not a substitute for impact. We believe that these programs will produce positive outcomes over many years. We are confident that they will help thousands of individuals to have a better chance of reaching their potential or securing their future. They also galvanize our people to act and get involved. They represent an effective model of corporate engagement — leveraging the firm’s skills, business and ability to bring different constituencies together and create new partnerships. Lastly, creative and meaningful initiatives help us to recruit and retain talented people who are committed to making a difference in every aspect of their lives. 
10,000 Women 
As we approach the third anniversary of 10,000 Women, the program is today well on its way to providing a business and management education to thousands of underserved women globally. Binding together a global network of over 70 world-class partners and operating in 22 countries — from China to India, from Afghanistan to the Americas, throughout Africa and the Middle East — over 3,000 women have participated in the program 
to date. We are very pleased that 10,000 Women is having a real impact in the countries where it operates: six months after graduation, nearly 71 percent of alumnae have increased revenues and over 50 percent have added new jobs. 
10,000 Small Businesses 
10,000 Small Businesses, a $500 million, five-year program aimed at catalyzing economic growth and job creation potential in the United States, has already reached nearly 200 small businesses, with partnerships established in New York, Los Angeles, Long Beach,
New Orleans and Houston. Inaugural classes have graduated from LaGuardia Community College in Queens, New York, Los Angeles City College and
Long Beach Community College District. To help more small businesses get the capital they need to grow, we are partnering with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to provide loans to small businesses. We are pleased to be working with the National Development Council, Seedco Financial Services, Inc., Valley Economic Development Center, Inc. and Hope Enterprise Corporation and look forward to joining with additional CDFIs to create more access to capital. 
And, consistent with the priority of pairing our people with our programs, over 150 of our own people have engaged directly with small business owners, reviewing business plans, providing financial analysis and offering strategic advice. We also have launched the program in the United Kingdom, specifically in Leeds and Manchester. This is the first initiative of its kind to bring together small businesses and social enterprises
to offer a business education, mentoring and networking to drive economic growth. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised fund established in 2007, was infused with $500 million
in 2009 and $320 million in 2010. Compensation
was reduced to fund these charitable contributions. Goldman Sachs Gives is already creating impact in four strategic areas—increasing educational opportunities, building and stabilizing communities, honoring service and veterans and creating jobs and economic growth. In 2010, over $210 million has been distributed to nonprofit organizations across the four areas above including over $40 million in support of need-based financial aid, scholarships, and other educational programs. Examples of commitments made in 2010 include: $20 million to the Harlem Children’s Zone, an innovative and successful model for breaking the cycle of generational poverty, focusing on a comprehensive “cradle to college” approach; and, $20 million to support a network of nonprofits helping wounded and disabled veterans return to civilian life through job placement, readiness, family support and counseling. 
Conclusion 
As in the past, our shareholder returns will continue to be dependent on: (1) the pace and sustainability of global economic growth; (2) the degree to which our clients are active in the capital markets; (3) the broad set of opportunities available to the firm and our ability to act upon them; and (4) the strength of our culture, driven by talented, innovative and team-oriented individuals. Looking forward, we are confident that Goldman Sachs is well-positioned to adapt and grow as economies, markets and our clients’ needs evolve. 
As we think about our industry in the last
30 years, it has often fought change fearing it was revolution as opposed to evolution. The world evolves, and for the financial services industry, the combination of economic forces, regulation and technology will mandate change producing more efficient markets, more competitive firms and more resilient economies. Some will fight change given the uncertainty that comes with it, but embracing change early has been fundamental
to Goldman Sachs’ success. 
In the last dozen years, Goldman Sachs has responded to a number of developments. We went from being an advisor to an integrated, larger scale provider of advice, financing and co-investment; from a largely domestic firm to a global one; from a smaller, private firm to a public Fortune 50 company. 
Being nimble is a very large part of our culture
and our success story. Staying close to our clients and listening to their evolving needs reinforces our willingness to accept and adapt to change. Of course, it is impossible to predict the future. That is why our enduring commitment to our client franchise and the hard work, commitment and collaboration of our people will remain cornerstones of our long-term success.

Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2011,"We began 2011 encouraged by an increase in client activity, greater CEO confidence, and early signs that economies were on the mend, but soon after experienced new measures of macro uncertainty that ultimately hindered a broad-based recovery. 
Challenges facing the Euro area advanced from a regional consideration to a global issue, leading to concerns about the potential for sovereign defaults, contagion and growing skepticism about the willingness of policymakers to address the situation. Not surprisingly, the operating environment led our clients across a 
variety of businesses to be materially more risk averse. The firm’s perspective on managing its risk exposures mirrored the sentiment of the broader market, and consequently, our risk exposures remained low in 2011. Ultimately, the confluence of macro-economic concerns, heightened market volatility, lower corporate activity and decreased risk appetite among our institutional clients translated into a fundamentally lower level 
of revenue opportunities over the course of the year, hampering our returns. 
For 2011, the firm produced net revenues of
$28.81 billion with net earnings of $4.44 billion. Diluted earnings per common share were $4.51 and
our return on average common shareholders’ equity was 3.7 percent for the year. Excluding the impact
of a $1.64 billion preferred dividend associated with our redemption of the firm’s preferred stock issued
to Berkshire Hathaway, diluted earnings per common share were $7.46 and our return on average common shareholders’ equity was 5.9 percent. Throughout the year, we continued to manage our liquidity and capital conservatively. At year-end, the firm’s Global Core Excess liquidity was $172 billion, and our Tier 1 capital and common ratios under Basel 1 were 13.8 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively. 
While our results suffered as a consequence of global conditions and dampened activity levels, we are pleased to report that the firm retained its industry-leading positions across our global investment banking client 
franchise. We finished 2011 with one of our best performances as a public company across the global league tables, ranked first in worldwide announced mergers and acquisitions (M&A), equity and equity- related offerings, common stock offerings and IPOs. 
Given the strength of our client franchise across
global capital markets, when economies and markets improve — and we see some encouraging signs of
this — we are confident Goldman Sachs will be well- positioned to provide further value to our clients and shareholders. As we help our clients manage through
this period, we will continue to focus on their evolving needs while prudently managing risk, shareholder capital and expenses to generate attractive returns. 
In this year’s letter, we would like to discuss how we
are approaching the current operating environment as well as review — through the lens of priorities articulated by our clients — the long-term growth opportunities
for Goldman Sachs. We spent more than one-half of our time last year away from the office meeting with clients around the world. Through these ongoing discussions, we gain a better understanding of emerging trends,
the challenges and goals our clients are focused on and the role we can play to help them. Taken individually
and as a whole, these interactions are fundamental to
our client-driven strategy. 
We will also share with you the significant progress we have made in implementing the recommendations of our Business Standards Committee, and talk about the people of Goldman Sachs, the contribution they make every day on behalf of our clients, and the critical role they play 
in our future success. Finally, we will update you on our corporate engagement initiatives designed to help drive job creation and growth. 
The Operating Environment in 2011 
While each downturn has its unique characteristics,
our industry has operated through a number of economic contractions over the past decade or so. In each instance, we saw more precipitous declines in U.S. growth expectations than what we experienced more recently. Nevertheless, last year’s weak economic conditions initiated a pullback in our clients’ strategic objectives and financing demands, a slowdown in market-making activities and depressed asset values across the investing spectrum. 
From a historical perspective, the reduction in our investment banking volumes during 2011 was, in many respects, in line with the drop we experienced following the Internet bubble during 2001. M&A declined as CEOs worried about execution risk, and debt and equity underwriting slowed due to higher volatility across markets. Lower asset prices and weakness in credit indices resulted in a negative impact on our Investing 
& Lending business. It is important to note, however, that losses in our asset portfolio were due to our mark-to- market discipline and are largely unrealized; the ultimate assessment of our investing and lending activities must be over a period of years, rather than a narrow snapshot. 
Risk, Discipline and Returns 
As we do in all market conditions, our approach amidst uncertainty has been to manage our risk levels prudently. Our adjusted leverage ratio at the end of 2011 was down approximately 50 percent from the end of 2007. We have further strengthened our liquidity position relative to pre-crisis levels. Our average Global Core Excess (highly liquid securities and cash instruments) is at near record levels, up more than twofold from four years ago, comprising close to 28 percent of our average adjusted assets. We have also made a concerted effort to reduce our level 3 (illiquid) assets which, since the end of 2007, are down 30 percent and represented approximately 
5 percent of our 2011 year-end balance sheet. 
Of course, as underlying conditions change, we will recalibrate our capital and liquidity profile to be in an optimal position to serve our clients, and to ensure 
that we are being strategic in managing the firm’s financial resources for our investors. If client demand
for risk capital remains muted and opportunities to invest and generate attractive returns are scarce, we may elect to reduce capital intensive portions of our balance sheet and return excess capital to shareholders through repurchases or dividends. 
Since the beginning of 2010, we have repurchased
more than $10 billion of common stock or approximately 16 percent of our common equity relative to 2009 year-end levels. We have also bought back the equivalent of close to 80 percent of the share count issued during the height of the crisis, while growing our book value
per common share by a compounded annual growth
rate in excess of 9 percent since the end of 2007. At the same time, we have increased our common equity by nearly 70 percent over this period while maintaining capital ratios near the top of our industry. 
Controlling Costs 
In addition, we have targeted approximately $1.4 billion of annual run-rate expense savings in order to function more efficiently, and believe we can further benefit from greater operational leverage in terms of infrastructure, technology and people in a number of key markets 
and businesses. As we gain a better understanding of where to deploy capital and resources and at what level, we will make the necessary adjustments to achieve stronger returns. 
It is important to note that, as for many of our clients and financial institutions to varying degrees, the costs
of conforming to new regulations have been significant. At the end of 2011, the firm’s regulatory-related headcount had nearly doubled from pre-financial crisis levels across a variety of functions. Our regulatory-related expenses have also nearly doubled during this period. 
In the shorter term, the heightened regulatory focus
will continue to demand considerable effort and expense; however, over time, we expect this trajectory to even out as infrastructure, systems and processes are rationalized and we and our regulators have gained greater clarity around final requirements. Ultimately, we hope to see the pendulum come to rest at a point that better reconciles effective oversight with the need to continue driving 
towards investment and growth. We will address other aspects of regulatory reform — particularly as they relate to our clients — later in the letter. 
Lastly, our focus on cost discipline includes adhering
to our pay for performance philosophy. In 2011, net revenues were down 26 percent and compensation and benefits expenses for our people were down 21 percent, with discretionary compensation down significantly more than net revenues. Over the past few years, we have also reduced compensation and benefits to net revenue ratios, with our average ratio over the past three years of approximately 39 percent being materially lower than our average ratio of approximately 45 percent from 
2005 through 2007. 
Our Client-Driven Strategy 
More than three years since the onset of the financial crisis, many institutions remain focused on working through its aftermath and managing risk in all its forms — whether related to liquidity, credit, market or regulation. Lower revenues and more subdued growth forecasts are causing some to question whether the industry is undergoing secular change, or more specifically, whether the model of providing advice, financing, market making, asset management and co-investing will continue to be relevant in the 
future landscape. 
Based on what we hear from our clients and the work we do on their behalf, put succinctly — we believe the core model remains more viable and important than ever. 
Among the forces affecting our industry, some are certainly cyclical — such as economic growth, corporate activity and risk appetite — and some are secular, such as those related to market structure, the influence of
the growth markets, technological advancements, or the regulatory landscape. Secular change requires that
over time we evolve and position ourselves in ways that continue to add value for our clients; for example, many services we provided over the telephone to our equity clients ten years ago are today both priced and executed automatically, promoting a more liquid and efficient marketplace for investors. Similar structural developments have occurred in foreign exchange, 
U.S. Treasuries and other areas. Our commitment of people and resources to growth markets also represents our response to long-term secular demands. 
It may be too early to conclude to what degree the current industry slowdown is secular versus more broadly cyclical. In any scenario, our strategy remains informed and driven by the insights and demands of our clients around the world. And, what we’ve heard consistently
is that as they respond to the long-term trends of globalization and technology, as well as macro-economic and demographic changes, what we do for them is not only still relevant — but critical. 
Every day our clients seek advice and financing; they
look to us to take the other side of a transaction to help hedge their risk; they need an asset manager to invest on their behalf and a co-investor ready to deploy capital towards promising growth opportunities. In short, clients look to us for these core client services both through periods of transition and at any stage of the economic cycle. Time and again in 2011, we saw sentiment shift rapidly, confirming that our strategy must always be rooted in the fundamental needs of our clients and in our ability to act quickly and effectively in their service. 
Investing in Long-Term Trends 
Comprehensive Advice and Risk Management 
A more global market has also yielded a more multi-faceted, and potentially more risky, business environment; this, in turn, has put demands on the quality and breadth of services that companies, institutions and governments require in order to operate with greater scale. For example, a client may need to hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations, navigate integration issues across borders, or manage the volatility of commodity prices. To address these types of needs, our ability to partner our Investment Banking franchise with our Institutional Client Services businesses enables clients to benefit from seamless advice and transfer risk directly to the firm to manage. Importantly, it allows 
our clients to get back to focusing on their underlying businesses and strategic objectives. 
In a similar vein, a growing practice among companies is to outsource the non-core or sub-scale parts of their business. In particular, we have seen an increase in
the outsourcing of insurance asset management globally, 
which has been accelerated by new capital regimes, greater demand as a result of the financial crisis and
a sustained low interest rate environment, making it more difficult to generate returns. Since 2004, industry- wide growth in outsourced general account assets has more than doubled from $500 billion to more than 
$1 trillion. Goldman Sachs is making a substantial investment in this area, having grown these assets by approximately $40 billion since 2008, representing an over 20 percent compounded annual growth rate. 
Global Opportunity Set 
While it is impossible to say how long economies will remain under pressure, when more consistent growth does return, our revenues tend to grow at a multiple of that growth. This drives our efforts to operate in more places — or put another way, to chase GDP growth. 
Between 2005 and 2010, international revenues
for Dow Jones companies grew by 35 percent while domestic revenue grew by just 15 percent. FTSE 50 companies have seen a similar trend as international revenue grew by 36 percent compared to a 4 percent decrease in domestic revenue over the same period. This also holds true in cross-border M&A, with aggregate volumes up 56 percent from 2007 relative to the four years prior. Since 2010, cross-border deals represent nearly 40 percent of overall M&A volumes. 
Consistent with these themes, we see opportunities across a number of regions and businesses driven by client demand. As companies have become more global and growth economies have benefited from greater wealth creation, market capitalization has also increased. China’s market capitalization has tripled as a percentage of world market capitalization from 2002 through 2010, with the U.S. contribution shrinking to 65 percent of its 2002 levels. Net revenues from our Asia business have more than doubled in 2011 compared with 2002. 
More than ever, our clients seek “local” expertise and advice. In response, over the past six years we have hired more than 1,350 professionals into countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and Korea. Around the world we now serve 4,000 more Investment Banking clients and approximately 3,000 more counterparties within our Institutional Client Services businesses 
over the same period. 
In the year ahead, cross-border M&A activity is poised
to continue and grow: in Europe, due to outbound activity from institutions looking to diversify; in China
as clients look for greater access to natural resources and end markets; and in Japan where companies are seeking external growth prospects with currency exchange rates close to post-war highs. Emerging markets M&A activity is also likely to regain momentum, led by inbound activity into Brazil, which has the most open foreign investment policy among the BRICs, and by enterprises in developing countries seeking brands and sales and marketing expertise which they lack in their home markets. 
We also see market share expansion opportunities.
The recent retrenchment by some financial institutions, especially in Europe, has the potential to change the competitive landscape. European peers have announced plans to lower headcount, shed risk-weighted assets and exit certain businesses altogether. Such deleveraging may lead to reduced lending capacity, higher new issuances, and greater secondary trading, creating opportunities for Goldman Sachs to intermediate asset sales to our investing clients. 
Clients and Regulatory Reform 
As mentioned, the potential impact of regulation has been an important theme over the past few years and certainly in 2011. We are working constructively with regulators around the world to contribute to effective and realistic implementation of new legislation and regulations, and remain focused on what reforms may mean for our industry, for our firm, and, most importantly, for our clients. In many of our conversations, clients have expressed concern about the impact their businesses 
may experience, including new margin requirements, potentially less market liquidity, wider spreads and less available, more expensive inventory. 
These and other factors will affect not only how
clients serve their customers but also their technological infrastructure, legal documentation and compliance areas. It is critical for us to understand the issues confronting our clients and to adapt our services accordingly to better meet their needs. When rules begin to take final shape, we will increasingly allocate resources to developing trading tools and clearing and settlement systems that will help our clients address these new realities. 
More broadly, we recognize that translating the statutory language into workable outcomes is challenging, and appreciate the effort made by all parties to strike the balance between flexibility and specificity. This is especially important with respect to the Volcker Rule — which restricts banking entities’ proprietary trading activities and certain interests in, and relationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds. As the process moves forward, it is critical that rulemaking proceed in 
a way that is not counterproductive to the ability of companies and investors to continue to use the capital markets to accomplish their business objectives. 
We believe it is critical that the final version of the Volcker Rule reflects a meaningful evolution from the one currently under proposal. This includes drawing an essential distinction between prohibited proprietary trading and the vitally important — and statutorily protected — market-making related, underwriting 
and hedging activities. 
Getting these issues right has serious, real-world consequences for our clients and other market participants who rely on the vital financial intermediation and capital-raising services that financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs provide. For example, if the constraints of the proposed rule define our ability to hedge in a way that makes it prohibitively expensive, 
or so narrowly that effectively prohibits it in some cases, our clients will be forced to hold more risk on their own books. This will increase the volatility of their earnings and hurt their share prices, which in turn will raise their cost of capital, reduce their capacity to invest, lower their returns to shareholders and diminish their appeal as strategic partners. 
The proposed restrictions on market making could also have wide-ranging adverse effects. For example, a company wishing to issue bonds to finance expansion plans, or a pension fund looking to sell a stake in its portfolio to fund near-term obligations, may turn to Goldman Sachs to underwrite or execute the transaction. In either case, we would typically engage in market-making related activities, and in doing so, may hold some of the assets on our books. 
Because market makers are willing to buy from and sell to clients in different market conditions, we need to know that we can carry this inventory for the optimal 
time, not a minimal time, and have judgments made
by people who are trying to determine an appropriately effective manner in which to dispose of the position; if restricted from doing this, market makers will provide less liquidity and at worse prices. For the bond issuer, this raises its cost of capital, and for the pension fund, this erodes savings, raises costs for employers and reduces pension security for the fund’s participants. 
Liquid capital markets are the jewel of America’s financial and economic system, the benefits of which
are felt by every industry and by all investors. Reduced liquidity and other inadvertent byproducts of the proposed rule pose obstacles to the free flow of capital and efficient allocation of resources throughout the global economy. This is capital that could otherwise go to investment and job creation, or be returned to shareholders. 
While the consequences of an overly restrictive application of the Volcker Rule are formidable, we are optimistic
that the intended results can be achieved in a way that will ultimately be better for all constituencies, including investors and companies around the world looking to access capital, expand and grow. To this end, we are recommending constructive changes to the proposed 
rule that would provide a much stronger foundation as market participants and regulators move forward. 
Implementation of Business Standards Committee Recommendations 
In January 2011, we released the Report of the
Business Standards Committee (BSC), which was the culmination of an extensive eight-month review across every major business, region and activity of the firm.
A significant amount of time and resources last year were devoted to implementing the report’s 39 recommendations. Over 400 of our people were directly involved, and many more indirectly, as the BSC recommendations are integrated into the day-to-day operations of the firm. To monitor and supervise the implementation process, we created an oversight group comprising senior leaders across the firm. Employee participation in implementation has spanned every level, division and region, demonstrating the commitment and openness within our organization to improving and strengthening Goldman Sachs. 
To date, our efforts have served to catalyze a renewed focus on client service and client communication; on strengthening our controls, processes and committee governance; on greater personal accountability and reputational risk management; and on reinforcing attributes of our culture and values. Importantly, we established the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee, which is composed of many of the firm’s most senior leaders, and puts clients at the heart of our approach to governance. This includes applying an elevated standard of professional judgment to all aspects of our business activities and in everything we do. As nearly every facet of the recommendations has a training component, we are implementing over 30 new BSC training programs, and embedding BSC-related content into over 90 existing training programs. 
In particular, the BSC emphasized the importance of articulating clearly both to our people and to our clients the nature of the roles we are asked to undertake across our various businesses, whether acting as advisor, fiduciary, market maker or underwriter. As part of the BSC, we retained an independent consultant to conduct non-attributable, in-depth, in-person discussions with senior management of a number of clients worldwide. Among the feedback we received was their desire for us to communicate more clearly the roles and responsibilities we undertake depending on the nature of the transaction and the objectives of the client. 
To this end, we implemented the Role-Specific Client Responsibilities framework, which does not capture every possible client interaction, but is designed to facilitate 
better communication with clients about our specific responsibilities in a given transaction type or business activity. To date, over 8,000 of our people have taken part in training focused on the different roles and responsibilities we assume in working with our clients. A central theme of the training is the need to be clear to ourselves and to our clients about the capacity in which we are acting and the responsibilities we have assumed. 
Chairman’s Forum 
Last year, we launched the third iteration of the Chairman’s Forum, a global initiative for managing directors designed to emphasize the importance of —
and our commitment to — reputational excellence and individual accountability. Structured to incorporate
key BSC recommendations, each of the 23 three-hour sessions featured an interactive case study presenting complex and multi-faceted scenarios for intensive discussion. This deep commitment of time by our senior leadership reinforces the priority we place on weighing reputational risk when making difficult business decisions, thinking broadly about individual responsibilities and escalating issues as appropriate. Our reputation is built upon our service to clients, our performance and the integrity of our people, each of whom carries with them responsibility for protecting the firm’s reputation in the judgments, actions and communications they undertake. 
Ongoing Evaluation 
As formal implementation of the BSC winds down, this is not the end of this process, but in many respects it is the beginning. Because the focus of this effort is rooted more in the judgment of our people than a formal rule set for decision making, we will also look to multiple sources of feedback — our clients, our people, regulators and other key stakeholders — to ensure that our commitment to improvement is a living, breathing and dynamic process. 
Our People 
Notwithstanding the forces of technology and globalization, ours is ultimately a human business, conducted person to person. A client relationship is only as strong as the Goldman Sachs professionals managing that relationship. The most important thing we can
do to enhance the value of our client franchise is to 
continue to retain our people and to hire the most talented individuals from around the world. We benefit from committed, seasoned leadership across the firm’s businesses and divisions, with an average tenure of over 20 years for members of our Management Committee. At the same time, almost 300,000 people applied for full-time positions at Goldman Sachs for 2010 and 2011. We hired less than 4 percent of that population, and though most had multiple offers, nearly nine out of ten people offered a job with us accepted. Once they arrive at Goldman Sachs, we do everything we can to ensure they have productive and stimulating careers. 
We go to great lengths to engage our people, listen to what’s on their minds, and where necessary, implement changes to ensure we remain an attractive and dynamic place to work. This past year, we conducted our People Survey, a biennial effort to solicit thoughts and opinions on how to maintain a strong culture and rewarding environment. The 2011 survey garnered more than 22,000 comments and suggestions, reflecting strong participation from across all levels and offices. Among the findings, our people indicated they remain excited 
to work at the firm and continue to value our culture of teamwork, and also pointed out areas where we
can do better. These suggestions and other data will continue to drive our key people initiatives, just as they have since we first polled our people in 2001. 
We are especially pleased that Goldman Sachs was named one of Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” on its most recent list, a distinction we have earned each year since the list’s inception 15 years ago. We are one of only 13 companies to do so. In addition, the firm placed fourth in the most recent
The Sunday Times “Best Companies to Work For” survey in the “Best Big Companies” category and was the highest-placed financial services company for the third consecutive year. Our commitment to diversity
was also recognized when Working Mother named us
to its “100 Best Companies for Working Mothers” and when the Human Rights Campaign Foundation awarded us the “Innovation Award for Workplace Equality”
and included us on its “Best Place to Work for LGBT Equality” list. 
Corporate Engagement 
Since 2008, Goldman Sachs has committed in excess
of $1.4 billion to philanthropic initiatives, including 10,000 Women, 10,000 Small Businesses and Goldman Sachs Gives, representing one of the largest contributions ever made by a corporation. Our efforts include working hand-in-hand with a global network of more than
100 academic and non-profit partners, as well as local
and national leaders. A record 26,500 of our people,
their friends and family participated in our global volunteer initiative Community TeamWorks last year, which celebrated its fifteenth season. In particular,
we were pleased to receive the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy’s 2011 Chairman’s Award for 10,000 Women, which speaks to the power of partnership between business, government and the non-profit sector. 
10,000 Women 
Having recently celebrated the program’s fourth anniversary, 10,000 Women has reached 5,500 women across 42 countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria, Brazil and China. In March, we were honored to join U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and First Lady
Michelle Obama to announce a new public-private partnership to expand the effort, and through Goldman Sachs Foundation’s 10,000 Women Department of State Women’s Entrepreneurship Partnership, we have already reached women in ten additional countries. In December, we were also pleased to partner with the Government of Denmark to provide 10,000 Women alumnae in Tanzania with affordable sources of capital. Most importantly, these women are applying what they learn to multiply
the program’s impact: within 18 months of graduating,
80 percent have increased their revenues, 66 percent
have added new jobs and 90 percent are mentoring other women and girls in their communities. 
10,000 Small Businesses 
Goldman Sachs continues to work with community colleges, Community Development Financial Institutions and non-profit organizations to provide small businesses with the education, business services and capital they
need to grow and create jobs. Through 10,000 Small Businesses, we have forged partnerships with more than 40 organizations, across six cities in the U.S. — New York, Los Angeles, Long Beach, New Orleans, Houston and 
Chicago — and four cities in the U.K. — London, Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham. Participating businesses range from metal fabrication shops to cafés, and from first-generation enterprises to long-standing family-owned companies. As we see with our 10,000 Women scholars, these small business owners are translating the knowledge they garner from the program into immediate growth in their local communities. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
The tradition of individual philanthropy remains a core tenet of our culture. In recent years, firm compensation  was reduced by nearly $900 million to support Goldman Sachs Gives, a donor-advised fund which allows partners at Goldman Sachs to recommend donations to qualified nonprofits globally. Through the program, the firm has distributed nearly 7,000 grants to organizations that seek to build and stabilize communities, honor service and veterans, increase educational opportunities, and create jobs and economic growth. 
Since 2010, Goldman Sachs Gives has provided approximately $70 million in need-based financial aid
to students at more than 100 colleges and universities across the globe. In advance of the 2012 Olympic Games, Goldman Sachs Gives also launched a sports initiative with two leading charities — Greenhouse and Right To Play — to improve the lives of at-risk youth in the U.K. and Middle East through access to athletic coaching. Goldman Sachs Gives continues to support nonprofits working to reintegrate wounded veterans into the civilian workforce, and is donating $20 million over five years
as a catalyst for new partnerships pertaining to veteran job placement and readiness, as well as support and counseling for family members. 
Looking Ahead 
As we continue to navigate the cross currents of change, we are faced with the challenge of remaining highly adaptive while also anchored in the traditions, tenets and values that have formed the foundation for our success. These recent years have tested the firm
like few other times in our history, but over this period, we have worked every day to demonstrate Goldman Sachs’ resiliency, resolve and commitment to our bedrock principles. Most importantly, we are thankful 
to our clients for entrusting us to work with them to achieve their most critical goals and objectives. Their demands will continue to drive our long-term strategy and we will remain acutely attuned to understanding and responding to their needs. 
It is difficult to predict with any accuracy which businesses will outperform in the months and years to come. However, looking ahead, while the traject"
"ry of c""",,,,
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2012,"When we wrote to you last, the global economy was experiencing macroeconomic strains, punctuated by concerns over potential sovereign defaults in Europe and struggling labor and housing markets in the U.S. These concerns weighed on markets and hindered a broad-based recovery. While 2012 presented its own challenges amidst rapidly shifting investor sentiment, we are pleased to report that Goldman Sachs performed relatively well, posting solid results. This performance
was the result of a competitive position defined by our deep and global client franchise, a mix of core businesses to which we have demonstrated a longstanding commitment, a healthy and strong balance sheet and the focus and enduring commitment of our people to our client-centered culture. 
For 2012, the firm produced net revenues of $34.2 billion,
a 19 percent increase from $28.8 billion in the prior year.
Net earnings of $7.5 billion increased by 68 percent from $4.4 billion in 2011. Diluted earnings per common share were $14.13, up more than three times from $4.51 in 2011. Our return on average common shareholders’ equity was 10.7 percent. Book value per common share increased by
11 percent during 2012, and has grown from $20.94 at the end of our first year as a public company in 1999 to $144.67, a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 16 percent over this period. Our capital management in 2012 reflected a prudent approach, as our capital ratios improved significantly, despite returning $5.5 billion to common shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. 
In this year’s letter, we would like to review the economic and market environment in 2012 and discuss the steps
we have taken to differentiate Goldman Sachs across the competitive landscape to ensure we are poised to seize upon new opportunities as they unfold. We then will address our response to structural changes reshaping the marketplace, including regulatory change, globalization and technology. Lastly, we will provide you with an update on the important work taking place across our corporate engagement initiatives that we believe are making a meaningful difference for 
many individuals and communities. 
The Operating Environment in 2012 
While the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and a weak recovery in the U.S. continued to persist throughout much of 2012, the deep uncertainty that permeated the recent past began to show signs of abating in the second half of the year. 
Despite ongoing political ambiguity both in the U.S. and Europe, generally improving economic data coupled with continued strong central bank actions helped stabilize corporate and investor sentiment. The European Central Bank enhanced its Long-Term Refinancing Operations to provide term liquidity at the end of 2011, and affirmed its support for the Euro. It also expressed its willingness to make outright purchases in the secondary bond market. While the potential for instability remains, these actions reduced systemic risk across Europe. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve continued to take steps to support markets and economic growth, while the labor and housing markets produced encouraging signs of stability and even some improvement. 
As corporate and investing clients digested these macroeconomic developments, activity levels increased in some areas and remained sluggish in others. For example, global debt issuance increased by 11 percent year over year, with high-yield issuance increasing by 38 percent. Conversely, global equity underwriting volumes were up only one percent and completed global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) volumes decreased by 18 percent and remained very low
as a percentage of market capitalization. 
Our Competitive Position 
For Goldman Sachs, the past few years have been a
period of both introspection and deliberate action, including a comprehensive examination of our business practices,
a disciplined focus on costs and how we allocate capital and a renewed sense of the importance of identifying the difference between cyclical and secular trends. This last area is especially important to our overall strategic framework. 
We never lose sight of the fact that we are stewards
of an industry-leading franchise that was built over nearly 145 years. This means that while we have an obligation to meet the near-term demands of the current environment in which we operate, we need not completely surrender to them. 
Nonetheless, the cyclical pressures facing our industry are real, and we have responded by reducing costs and proactively managing our capital. If the environment deteriorates further, we will take additional action. 
At the same time, we will continue our investment in
and commitment to our broad set of institutionally focused businesses that have a track record of providing higher returns than many other businesses within financial services. 
We believe that providing effective advice, financing significant transactions and providing liquidity, especially in difficult markets, will be no less important going forward. 
“Our focused business model, global footprint
and culture of teamwork- oriented professionals put us in a strong position to meet our clients’ needs and generate superior returns for our shareholders.” 
Our focused business model, global footprint and culture of teamwork-oriented professionals put us in a strong position to meet our clients’ needs and generate superior returns for our shareholders. In addition, durable long-term trends, such as regulation, globalization and technology, will continue to have a profound effect on economies and markets. And, in these areas, we have protected our ability to be proactive. 
As we have often stated, our businesses do not lend themselves to predictable earnings. However, over the
long term, we are committed to the goal of providing our shareholders with returns on equity at the top of our industry, while continuing to grow book value and earnings per share. 
Controlling Costs 
A significant element of providing healthy returns is a disciplined focus on expenses. Our ability to achieve operating leverage was particularly important in 2012 when economic growth remained challenged. 
Markets, by their construction, reflect the natural ebb and flow of economic activity, which means moving between periods of expansion and contraction. For this reason, it should not be surprising that in a period of contraction and uncertainty we would experience lower levels of corporate and investor activity and risk appetite. 
Of course, we respect cycles, which can sometimes last a very long time. They can be so consequential that, if one does not react early enough, you not only forego the benefits of the cyclical upturn, but also risk the ability to recover at all. 
With this in mind, we announced a $1.2 billion expense savings initiative with our second quarter 2011 earnings. We subsequently increased that to a run-rate of $1.9 billion in expense savings. 
As part of our expense initiative, our overall headcount was down nine percent over the past six quarters. At the same time, we have increased the number of people in certain high value locations, including Bangalore, Salt Lake City, Dallas and Singapore. Since 2007, the number of our people in these locations has nearly doubled, and today represents 23 percent of the firm’s population. 
We also have focused on closing certain businesses that are not core, have lower returns and/or impose excessive capital charges. For example, we sold our hedge fund administration business, which provides various accounting and processing services to hedge funds. Many of the activities in that business were less central to the services we provide hedge funds through prime brokerage, an important business for the firm. 
In another area related to expenses, we have demonstrated a strong commitment to aligning compensation with performance, establishing a very close relationship between the firm’s revenue and compensation. In short, we compensate better in good years and have restricted pay in weaker ones. 
For example, in 2011, our net revenues were down
26 percent. As a result, our compensation and benefits expenses were down 21 percent. In 2012, net revenues rose 19 percent from the previous year and compensation and benefits expenses increased by six percent. 
Our approach to compensation flexibility is also demonstrated through our compensation ratio, which has averaged 39 percent over the past four years — more than six percentage points lower than our average ratio in the four years before the financial crisis. Last year, our compensation ratio was the second lowest since we became a public company. 
Opportunities & Our Client Franchise 
While tactical and strategic actions are always important, ultimately, our success begins and ends with our clients. 
It is only through ongoing discussions with our clients that we gain a better understanding of emerging trends, the challenges and goals that are our clients’ focus and the role we can play to help them. The opportunities we find most attractive are invariably rooted in our fundamental strategy of integrating capital with advice to help our clients meet their near-term needs and long-term objectives. 
Like no other time in recent history, access to diversified sources of funding is becoming a strategic imperative and
is driving the further development of capital markets in many parts of the world. Roughly 70 percent of all corporate funding in the U.S. comes from capital markets activity; in Europe, the situation is nearly the opposite, with the bulk 
of funding coming from bank loans. 
In leveraged finance, however, 58 percent of the issuance in Europe since 2010 were bonds — compared to just
14 percent in the three years preceding the 2008 crisis. We expect that higher capital requirements, which we 
“The opportunities we find most attractive are invariably rooted in our fundamental strategy of integrating capital with advice to help our clients meet their near-term needs and long-term objectives.” 
will discuss in greater detail, will mean less bank lending and more bond issuance. This presents a real opportunity for Goldman Sachs to engage with and help our clients to secure the funding they need to expand and prosper. 
Clients call on us throughout their company’s lifecycle when looking for funding, when they debut on a public exchange, when they face critical decisions, such as whether to buy or sell a business line, or when they are looking for a business partner that may be halfway around the world. In every instance, we look to develop the relationship based on the evolving needs of our clients, and understand that by focusing on their success, our own will follow. 
We are pleased that in 2012 Goldman Sachs ranked first
in worldwide announced and completed M&A as well as in global equity and equity-related offerings. 
Providing liquidity and making markets for our clients has
also grown in importance at a time when the industry’s collective capacity to assume risk has decreased with the
exit or downsizing of many of our competitors. We believe that our early and long-term investments in both technology and people have allowed us to maintain a first-tier institutional client platform that is being scaled efficiently for increased volumes and reduced transaction costs for our clients. 
Secular Trends 
While always mindful of cyclical conditions and potential outcomes, we have long been focused on the structural trends that will have long-term effects on economies and the underlying structure of markets. Regulation, globalization and technology are especially significant. 
Regulation & Capital Management 
New requirements expected under Basel 3 — a global regulatory standard on capital adequacy and liquidity
risk — make the efficient use of capital more important than ever. Basel 3 will significantly impact the amount of capital attributed to certain businesses. Risk-weighted assets under Basel 3 are estimated to be roughly 40 percent higher for financial institutions in the U.S. than under Basel 1 as of
the end of 2012. 
As the industry awaits greater clarity on the final rules, we are carefully managing our risk-adjusted capital levels. We have a long track record of allocating capital and other scarce resources based on risk-adjusted returns, providing greater balance sheet and resources to higher return businesses while downsizing or eliminating lower return businesses. 
To assist us in making the right decisions as they relate to capital allocation, we have begun to roll out technology that enables us to see capital charges at a granular level — often by individual security. We use the software to run analyses when buying or selling securities in our sales and market- making businesses in order to understand the capital implications associated with different scenarios. 
By understanding the key drivers of our risk positions, our securities professionals can more effectively deploy and manage our capital. It also helps us to serve clients better. Sales professionals can better understand how different clients consume capital through added exposure, risk weightings and other contributors to their overall profile. 
Managing capital usage more precisely can translate into greater risk capacity for our clients and greater capital efficiency for the firm. This provides not only a basis from which to understand and improve returns, but also operating leverage when the opportunity set expands. 
While Basel 3 capital rules are not final and not expected to be fully phased in until 2019, we expect that we will ultimately operate with a capital cushion of about 100 basis points above our regulatory requirement. 
New Capital Requirements and Size & Complexity 
The increase in the cost of capital has been joined by a corresponding rise in the cost associated with an institution’s scale. For more than a decade, larger size and complexity were viewed entirely as synergistic and virtuous. However, as capital surcharges associated with size and complexity are introduced, the costs and barriers to entry in some businesses will be raised and institutions will be forced to 
be more disciplined about their resource allocation. 
Although we have significant scale in each of our businesses, many of our investment banking competitors also have sizeable commercial and consumer businesses, which will cause them to hold additional capital against their entire balance sheet. Any synergy from housing multiple businesses together must be weighed against the requirements for 
more capital and liquidity. For the first time, it is clear that size and complexity come with a higher cost. 
Globalization 
One theme that we believe will continue to play an integral part in economic growth is globalization. Among other trends, it reflects the emergence of vital new markets across regions of the world, as well as the evolution and integration of these economies into the global financial system. We continue
to expect many of these economies, notably the BRICs, to remain on a path to becoming important anchors for the global economy, as their financial systems mature. 
Cross-border transactions represent roughly one-third
of global volume, as companies with large exposure to developed markets continue to look beyond their borders for attractive acquisition targets to enhance growth. 
In addition, emerging market companies and investors, particularly those in Asia and Latin America, are increasingly looking for value and opportunistic acquisitions in key developed markets. In 2012, transactions volumes within the BRICs represented nearly one-fifth of global M&A and IPOs. 
More specifically, we anticipate further reforms in China’s capital markets over the next five years, which will meaningfully increase the size of these markets, and by extension, the opportunity for Goldman Sachs to play a role in facilitating market activity on behalf of our clients. 
Technology 
Technology plays a crucial role in our response to regulatory change, as well as in optimizing operational efficiency, managing risk and serving our clients. The firm has long been a technological innovator, helping found Archipelago, ICE, TradeWeb, FXaII and BrokerTec, among other leading-edge marketplaces. 
Within our Equities business, a majority of shares are now traded through low-touch channels. We also are seeing a similar trend in the fixed income markets. In the cash fixed income markets, electronic execution is well developed, representing approximately 80 percent of the FX spot forward market and nearly 20 percent of the rates and credit cash markets. In derivatives, approximately 50 percent of the liquid credit index market trades electronically; in the FX options market, the number is ten percent. 
To keep pace with the rapid evolution in electronic trading, it is critical that we continue to innovate and create greater operational efficiencies. In fact, the automation of our back-office processing has been a natural follow-on to more electronic trading. 
One example is the migration of our low-touch equities flow to electronic processing. Of the flow that has moved over, failed trades have declined by more than 95 percent. We expect that, over time, all low-touch trades and a significant amount of high-touch trades will be processed digitally as well. 
We also rely on technology to manage risk effectively. While judgment remains paramount, the speed, comprehensiveness and accuracy of information can materially enhance or hinder effective risk decision making. We mark to market approximately 6 million positions 
every day. And, we rely on our systems to run stress scenarios across multiple products and regions. In a single day, our systems use roughly 1 million computing hours for risk management calculations. 
As a firm, our ability to adapt to regulatory change is enhanced from having all of our positions represented on
one risk system, improving our efficiency and communication. Not having to manage and integrate different systems
across our businesses will be critical to taking full advantage of the move to standardization, which benefits our clients
and the financial system’s transparency and resiliency. 
A Legacy and New Additions
to Our Board of Directors
After 32 years at Goldman Sachs and 12 years as chief financial officer, David Viniar retired from the firm at the end of January 2013. We are pleased that he has joined our Board of Directors as a non-independent director. 
David helped transform the firm’s risk control and operating infrastructure from the time we were a private company through a period of unprecedented market challenges
and regulatory change. David represents the very best of Goldman Sachs, and will remain an example of rigor, work ethic, collegiality and decency for many years to come. 
We thank David for his remarkable service, and look forward to continuing to benefit from his judgment and experience as a member of our Board. 
We are pleased that Harvey Schwartz is our new
CFO. Harvey’s risk management judgment and broad understanding of our businesses and our clients have defined his career and will be the basis of his strengths as an effective CFO. 
In addition to David, we were pleased to announce two additions to our Board of Directors, Mark Tucker and Adebayo Ogunlesi. 
Mark is the group chief executive and president of AIA
Group Limited, the world’s largest independent, publicly listed pan-Asian life insurance group. Mark brings broad and deep operating and strategic experience across Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. He has nearly three decades
of leadership in the insurance and banking sectors and a proven understanding of effective risk management. 
Adebayo is the managing partner and chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm that invests worldwide in infrastructure assets in the energy, transport, and water and waste industry sectors. He brings over 
20 years of experience in finance and the global capital markets to our Board of Directors. He has advised companies and institutions around the world and invested in many of
the most important sectors in the global economy. 
We know that our Board, our shareholders and our people will benefit from their strengths and perspectives. 
Our People and Culture 
The strength of our business has always been defined by the quality of our people and our performance-driven culture. Since the days of our founding, we have recognized that the quality of our people differentiates the firm and will serve
as the cornerstone of our success. Over the past two years, we have received nearly 300,000 applications. We hired fewer than three percent of our applicants and nearly nine out of 10 people accepted the offer to join Goldman Sachs. 
We are proud to report that, in 2012, Goldman Sachs was named one of Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For,” one of only 13 companies that have earned that distinction each year since the list’s inception 16 years ago 
We were also recognized by Working Mother, which named us to its “100 Best Companies for Working Mothers” list. Further, our diversity efforts were noted by the Human Rights Campaign, which awarded us the Corporate Equality Award for the first time, and included us on its “Best 
Place to Work for LGBT Equality” list. 
Corporate Engagement 
Since 2008, Goldman Sachs has committed in excess of $1.6 billion to philanthropic endeavors, including 10,000 Women,10,000 Small Businesses and Goldman Sachs Gives. While the amounts are significant, it is the quality and 
effect of these programs that matter the most. 
In 2012, each of our initiatives was expanded to include new participants and partners, and today, 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses reach small business owners in more than 50 markets around the world, through a network of nearly 200 academic and non-profit partners. 
“Since the days of
our founding, we have recognized that the quality of our people differentiates the firm and will serve as
the cornerstone of
our success.” 
10,000 Women 
10,000 Women is providing 10,000 underserved women entrepreneurs with a business and management education, access to mentors and networks and links to capital. Since its inception in 2008, the program has assisted nearly 
7,500 women-owned businesses drawn from more than
40 countries, and is on track to reach its 10,000th woman in 2013. Delivered through a network of nearly 100 academic and non-profit partners, 10,000 Women continues to yield promising results. An independent report reviewing program graduates in India published by the International Center
for Research on Women found that nearly 80 percent of surveyed scholars have increased revenues and 66 percent have added new jobs within 18 months after graduation. 
10,000 Small Businesses 
In 2012, 10,000 Small Businesses continued to expand its network of cities and partners to provide small businesses with the education, business services and capital they need to grow and create jobs. In the U.S., Salt Lake City and Cleveland joined the program, while the first cohort graduated in Chicago. By year’s end, the program was operating in 
14 markets in the U.S. and U.K. In 2012, the program also launched an access to capital initiative specifically targeted at rural regions in the U.S., such as those in Montana and eastern Kentucky. In all markets where 10,000 Small Businesses operates, we continue to see a wide variety of business owners from all industries participate, as we convene local public, private and non-profit institutions to ensure the program addresses specific community needs. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
Goldman Sachs Gives is a donor-advised fund through which participating managing directors of the firm can recommend grants to qualified non-profit organizations around the world. Since the beginning of 2010, the firm has contributed nearly $1.1 billion to Goldman Sachs Gives, and 10,000 grants totaling more than $575 million have been made to various organizations in 35 countries. Since the fund was created, more than $270 million has been granted to community organizations supporting veterans, poverty alleviation, medical research and other significant areas 
“We believe strongly that Goldman Sachs
is well positioned to realize the opportunities presented by the emerging competitive landscape.” 
of need and in excess of $105 million has been granted to approximately 125 colleges and universities to support financial aid. In 2012, more generally, approximately $157 million was distributed through more than 4,500 individual grants. 
In October 2012, the firm played a leading role in helping to respond to the destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy in the New York and New Jersey area. Goldman Sachs committed a total of $10 million to relief and recovery efforts, including $5 million in small business loans and $5 million in grants from Goldman Sachs Gives. These grants also helped fund long-term housing and small business reconstruction and recovery. Equally important, nearly 1,200 volunteers across the firm donated their time to help in the immediate and ongoing recovery efforts. 
Looking Ahead 
Each year as we look to the next, we also are prompted
to consider our recent past. It has been a period of reflection as an organization, an opportunity to focus on improving wherever we could to make us a better firm, and a time
to think about our future — where we can most help our clients and advance their interests to spur more economic growth and opportunity. 
In 2008 and 2009, our focus was on stabilizing and fortifying the firm amidst the most turbulent days of the global financial crisis. In 2010 and 2011, we engaged in a rigorous and comprehensive review of our business practices, committed to self-prescribed changes and took aggressive steps to implement them. In 2012, while navigating constantly shifting economic and market sentiment, we remained true to our core businesses, investing in our client franchise and our people. 
Heading into 2013, we remain cautious given the ever-present risks and challenges to the markets and
global economy. At the same time, we are encouraged
by early signs of broad-based improvement. When
one considers many of the issues that still weigh on market sentiment — such as the Eurozone crisis, China’s growth trajectory and fiscal cliff concerns in the U.S. — most are not intractable and will be resolved. 
We believe strongly that Goldman Sachs is well positioned to realize the opportunities presented by the emerging competitive landscape, hopefully more normalized economic growth trajectories and the expanded opportunity set that the confluence of these developments will provide. 
We can achieve these goals by remaining focused on the needs of our clients, committed to prudent risk management, disciplined with our capital and expenses, focused on superior execution and intent on building on our market- leading positions. Our people and the culture they reflect
put us in a position to meet these imperatives, and, in doing so, we have never been more confident in our ability to achieve attractive returns and create long-term value for
our shareholders. 
"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2013,"This past year for the global economy may be best described as one of incremental, but noticeable improvement. In the United States, the economic recovery finally began to take hold with continued underlying economic growth and slowly accelerating gains in the labor market. In Europe, while conditions remained broadly difficult, we began to see nascent growth and, in certain countries, such as the United Kingdom, a more advanced recovery. 
Fears of a sharp slowdown in China receded somewhat
and the country’s new leadership signaled a more assertive posture on economic and financial reform. In Japan, aggressive fiscal and monetary policies spurred a reinvigorated economic and financial environment. 
At the same time, political impasse in the United States for much of the year and uncertainty over central bank policy both highlighted and, to some extent, contributed to the fragility of the economic recovery. As a result, many of our clients remained cautious, which hindered a broad-based resumption of their business activities. 
Amidst these shifting factors, we are pleased to report that Goldman Sachs performed relatively well, generating solid results for the year. This was the by-product of our commitment to a core set of businesses and actions we 
have taken over the last several years in three important areas: strengthening our balance sheet, allocating capital efficiently across our businesses and managing our costs prudently. 
For 2013, the firm produced net revenues of $34.2 billion
and net earnings of $8.0 billion, an eight percent increase from $7.5 billion of net earnings in 2012. Diluted earnings per common share were $15.46 compared with $14.13 for 2012. Our return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 11.0 percent. Book value per common share increased by approximately five percent during 2013 and has grown from $20.94 at the end of our first year as a public company in 1999 to $152.48, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15 percent over this period. Our capital management in 2013 reflected a prudent approach as our capital ratios continued 
to improve despite returning $7.2 billion to common shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. 
In this year’s letter, we would like to review the significant steps we have taken in recent years to adapt and respond to the post-financial crisis world, and, building on those efforts, our priorities for enhancing returns to our shareholders going forward. In that vein, we also will discuss our competitive position across our major businesses. Lastly, we want to share with you some of the initiatives we undertook related to our people, culture and business standards and practices. 
The past year marked the five-year anniversary of the global financial crisis. Later in the letter, we will discuss the impact of the changes we have made from the extensive review of our business standards and practices. Importantly, this is also an opportune time to highlight the significant actions the firm has taken over the last five years related to our capital, liquidity and overall financial profile to adapt to the realities of the operating and, more specifically, regulatory environment. Some of those actions are represented to the right. 
We have focused not only on strengthening our balance sheet, but also on ensuring that we are allocating capital efficiently both to meet the needs of our clients and to generate stronger returns going forward. 
New regulation is pushing the industry to be even more sensitive to risk-adjusted returns, whether through higher capital requirements or the application of stress tests. Over time, this may translate into greater pricing discipline across the entire industry, which we view as a positive development. 
Well in advance of any regulations being finalized, we have been focused on developing and implementing tools to help us better price the provision of liquidity to the marketplace, and better manage our capital usage. In that regard, at the conclusion of 2013, our estimated transitional Basel III Advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was in excess of 11 percent. 
Another important capital management effort that we have undertaken is refining our business mix in light of new capital requirements. Certain businesses, like the Americas reinsurance and European insurance businesses, no longer generated attractive returns under a Basel III framework and, as a result, we opted to sell 
a majority stake in them. 
Even with investments, such as the longstanding one that Goldman Sachs had in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), which was both strategic and financial, we elected to make adjustments given the new capital requirements. Collectively, ICBC and our insurance businesses used approximately 125 basis points of the Basel III Advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and consumed 
$40 billion of balance sheet. 
While these are three larger, public examples, we continue to make risk-adjusted return decisions across the firm every day. 
Shareholder Returns 
As a firm, we have a long track record of delivering superior returns to our shareholders over the cycle. We demonstrated this before the financial crisis, during it and after. If you look at our average ROE since the onset of the financial crisis
in 2007, we have outperformed each of our U.S. competitors, having produced an average ROE during this period of more than four times the peer average. 
Nevertheless, while we have generated solid returns in the last five years, they fall below our aspirations. We are committed to improving them notwithstanding 
the challenges presented in the current environment. At the same time, we want to protect our ability to provide significant upside to shareholders as the economic cycle turns. 
By focusing on revenues, expenses and capital efficiency, we are building near-term benefits, but also driving material operating leverage into our business. 
Our performance over the last few years is an important example of the firm’s ability to proactively manage a cyclical business and to capitalize on creating operating leverage
in our business model. In 2011, we announced an initial
$1.2 billion expense savings initiative, the size of which was subsequently increased twice, ultimately reaching a run-rate of $1.9 billion. In 2012, a 19 percent increase in net revenues translated into an 82 percent increase in pre-tax earnings and a ROE expansion to 10.7 percent. In 2013, despite essentially unchanged net revenues, our continued focus on expenses enabled us to grow pre-tax earnings by five percent and expand ROE to 11.0 percent. Longer term, we expect that 
a more robust environment will enable us to deliver even more operating leverage to our shareholders. 
With respect to capital management, our strong capital generation and balance sheet management have allowed us to grow our Basel III ratio while returning capital to shareholders. Since year-end 2010, we have repurchased approximately $17 billion of our shares, and reduced our basic share count by approximately 80 million shares or 15 percent, while our U.S. peers, taken together, actually showed an average increase in share count. Our approach drives shareholder value through both higher returns and growth in earnings
per common share. 
Controlling Costs 
In addition to effective capital management, we are acutely focused on expense management as a lever for driving incremental shareholder returns. From 2009 through 2013, our average compensation and benefits expense to net revenues ratio was approximately 880 basis points lower than the average ratio from 2000 to 2007. 
Compensation and benefits is our largest expense and we remain committed to paying for performance. In lower net revenue years, like 2008 and 2011, we demonstrated significant flexibility in our compensation and benefits expense. In years with net revenue growth, this expense 
generally increased at a lower rate than net revenues, thereby driving operating leverage and enhancing shareholder returns. 
The firm remains committed to operating efficiently for
our shareholders, while providing world-class service to our clients. Of course, maintaining discipline around costs requires making tough decisions regarding staffing levels
and compensation. We have strived to get the balance right, between improving shareholder returns and investing in the future of our client franchise. To do so, we have leveraged technology, adjusted our allocation of resources and managed both compensation and non-compensation expenses. 
Our expense savings initiatives included enhancements in technology and greater geographic diversity in our workforce. Currently, we have approximately 8,200 staff, or roughly
25 percent of our workforce, located in Bangalore, Salt Lake City, Dallas and Singapore, compared with 10 percent in 2007. Additionally, 38 percent of all campus and experienced hires since 2011 have been hired into those offices. 
We were among the first global banks to embark on
an expense savings initiative and, although painful, the exercise was necessary. Being an early mover allowed ongoing recognition of savings over the past two years and protected returns in what continues to be a challenging operating environment. 
Growth and the State of Our Client Franchise 
While we have strengthened our balance sheet, prioritized efficient capital allocation and taken a disciplined approach
to costs, we have continued to invest in a broad set of institutionally focused businesses that have a track record
of providing higher returns than many other businesses within financial services. Because of a consistent focus on our clients’ needs and orienting our businesses to meet their ongoing objectives, we believe we have provided solid returns in a challenging period, while seeking to protect our ability to provide significant upside to our shareholders as 
the economic cycle turns. 
We believe our businesses are particularly well positioned
for the time when broad-based growth resumes. And, we see reasons to be confident in the fundamentals of the global economy. While emerging markets typically entail higher risk and volatility, we believe that over time they will generate stronger growth as the middle class in those countries 
expands and consumption and investment trends evolve.
In developed economies, greater CEO confidence is
driving more strategic acquisitions as more companies are committing to longer term growth plans. Investor sentiment has also rebounded, and more companies are taking advantage of a better operating environment to raise equity and debt. In the U.S., the process of ending quantitative easing has begun, and while unsettling for certain markets, the move to a more normalized market environment is necessary and ultimately reassuring. All of these trends 
play to the strengths and position of our businesses. 
Investment Banking 
Investment Banking not only includes our advisory and financing services; it also serves as an important source of opportunities for all parts of the firm. For example, working with clients in our financing business often drives demand for hedging solutions, while our advisory franchise can create opportunities for co-investment with our business partners. 
We continue to demonstrate outperformance in our advisory franchise. In 2013, we ranked first in both announced and completed global mergers and acquisitions. 
Our equity underwriting franchise was equally strong in
2013, ranking first in global equity and equity-related offerings, common stock offerings and initial public offerings (IPOs). We served as bookrunner on eight of the ten largest IPOs for the year. The technology sector was especially active and Goldman Sachs was the lead-left bookrunner for nearly twice as many technology IPOs in the U.S. than the next most active underwriter. 
In debt underwriting, we had our best year ever in net revenues. While we believe that we could further strengthen our league table position, we do not aim to be ranked first in this business. Despite our natural desire to be ranked at the top of any league table, we believe achieving that position,
in this case, would require a significant increase in lending
at rates that would ultimately dilute long-term returns. Our approach could change to the extent that regulatory changes drive more attractive pricing. 
More broadly, the past year represented one of our strongest market share performances in our advisory and underwriting franchises since 2000. 
Institutional Client Services 
In Institutional Client Services, our equities franchise is
built on the premise of providing a broad suite of services
to our investing clients. This means having a state-of-the-art electronic platform, comprehensive prime brokerage services and the capacity to be an effective liquidity provider for
our clients. 
It also means leveraging our global technology platform to have a scalable “high touch” and “low touch” approach to meeting our clients’ needs. It is not sustainable to have only one approach if your goal is to serve a diverse set of clients and to produce strong returns. Clients determine how they engage the firm, and they are increasingly looking to transact electronically with us in both cash and derivative products. 
The long-term demand, however, for product innovation and “high touch” services remains. So, our ability to offer unique solutions across equities products continues to be critical
to our clients. This dual approach of “high touch” and 
“low touch” is a by-product of the many market structure and regulatory changes in the equity markets over the past 15 years. Our ability to adjust to a changing regulatory environment has been critical to maintaining a leadership position within our Equities business. 
This is also true in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution (FICC). We maintain a leading position across a broad range of products and geographies, with
a focus on being responsive to our clients’ needs. There is considerable discussion about the outlook for FICC given the numerous regulatory changes taking place and the 
lower client volumes. We remain committed to our FICC businesses, which, here again, reflects the value our clients place on the services that we provide in these markets. And, our commitment has allowed our client franchise to grow. Over the past three years, for example, the number of corporate and growth market relationships have each grown by approximately 30 percent. 
Some of our competitors may elect to deemphasize or exit some FICC businesses, given their particular circumstances. But, we believe this is likely to increase the value that clients place on the services provided by those who remain, especially as broader economic activity rebounds and the trading environment improves. 
”The past year represented one of our strongest market share performances in our advisory
and underwriting franchises
since 2000.” 
For our FICC businesses, providing liquidity to our investing clients requires us to take risk, and as a consequence, FICC
is the largest consumer of our capital. Our commitment to these businesses does not mean that we haven’t taken significant action regarding how we utilize capital. We have meaningfully reduced risk-weighted assets in FICC and are very focused on managing it for risk-adjusted returns. Chasing revenue market share within FICC businesses can lead to 
risk management lapses and inferior returns. Focusing on the right balance between risk, revenue and returns has been important to building a leading global franchise and consistently delivering strong returns for our shareholders. 
Investment Management 
With total assets under supervision surpassing a record trillion dollars, our Investment Management business is
one of the largest in the world. We have a strong position across a diverse set of products spanning all major asset classes and geographies. And, despite the challenging market environment, we have been able to grow long-term assets under supervision by 36 percent since the beginning of 2007. 
Additionally, we have expanded our defined contribution franchise, with approximately $50 billion in new assets from our acquisition of Dwight Asset Management and our pending acquisition of Deutsche Bank’s stable 
value business. 
Like our other businesses, success in Investment Management is a function of performing for our clients. Our asset-weighted mutual fund performance has been above the industry average for nine consecutive quarters through 2013. Two-thirds of our mutual fund assets were ranked in the top two quartiles by Morningstar across one, three and five year performance periods. 
As performance has improved, so have asset inflows. We had net sales in long-term assets under supervision of $41 billion, the highest since 2007, which were broadly distributed across our three key client channels: High-net- worth individuals, Third-party distributed and Institutional. This focus on performance has been a critical component in generating our highest net revenues for Investment Management since 2007. 
Investing & Lending 
Investing & Lending includes direct investing, our investing through funds, as well as lending to both corporations and high-net-worth individuals. 
Our investing activity, including co-investing with our clients, has established itself as an important complement to our other franchise businesses. We have a history of strong investment performance over the years, and that reputation, along with deep client relationships, have allowed us to invest in opportunities that are not available to others. 
Our debt investments are driven by senior loan and mezzanine investments, and our direct financing and lending businesses. Our Investing & Lending business includes approximately
$31 billion of direct loans, primarily extended to corporate clients and high-net-worth individuals. Our equity investments include private equity funds, direct equity investments and hedge fund investments. The “Volcker Rule,” which we will discuss in more detail, limits our ability to invest in hedge funds and private equity through a fund structure; as such, for some time now in anticipation, we have been redeeming our hedge fund investments to be compliant. While we’ve been actively harvesting our private equity funds, solid asset price performance has kept balance sheet levels relatively flat. 
Our investing and lending activities are synergistic
with our other activities and are valuable to our clients.
We remain committed to these businesses and, now with greater regulatory clarity, we know that with the necessary adjustments, we will continue to work with our clients
as an investor. 
Regulation 
In December, regulators passed the final Volcker Rule, which restricts banking entities’ proprietary trading activities and certain interests in, and relationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds. 
Throughout the rulemaking process, we stated that it was critical that the rulemaking proceed in a way that is not counterproductive to the ability of companies and investors to continue to use the capital markets to accomplish their business objectives. 
Importantly, the final Volcker Rule explicitly permitted market making, lending and investing on balance sheet. Regulators allowed these activities because financial intermediation plays an essential role in capital raising and risk management, supporting broader economic activity and growth. 
As we indicated earlier, while the rule was only recently finalized, we have been preparing to comply with certain portions of the rule for nearly three years. We liquidated substantially all of our proprietary trading positions, specifically our Principal Strategies and our Global Macro Proprietary positions. And in 2012, we announced our intention to redeem certain hedge fund investments. Since then, we have redeemed approximately $2.2 billion of hedge fund investments and we will continue to redeem our interests. 
We are now focused on ensuring that we are in the position to effectively and efficiently comply with the requirements of this new and significant legal regime. 
Our People 
The quality and breadth of our client franchise are a direct by-product of our ability to attract and retain high-caliber professionals. As an investment bank, our main asset is
our people and the advice and solutions that they provide to our clients. Great people build great relationships. And, we are fortunate to have a diverse group of young people from around the world who continue to view Goldman Sachs as
a great place to begin and sustain their careers. For our latest analyst class, more than 43,000 candidates applied for 1,900 positions. We accepted about four percent of those applicants and of those receiving offers, more than 80 percent accepted. 
In 2013, we were proud to be named as one of Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Goldman Sachs is one of only five companies to be recognized every year that the Great Place to Work Institute has issued its list since 1984. 
Of course, we operate in a global and competitive industry and we seek to attract from the broadest pool of talented 
”The quality and breadth of our client franchise are a direct by-product of our ability to attract and retain high-caliber professionals.” 
people available. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that we are always adapting to the realities of a workplace, especially one now shaped by instant connectivity. 
This past year, we closely examined the day-to-day work environment for junior bankers and its connection to long-term career development. After that review, we announced a series of initiatives so that these young professionals receive more regular feedback and career development guidance, more time with their managers and clients and more consistent and predictable periods when they can plan to be out of the office. We also are using new technology that will make the process of creating client- related materials easier. The goal through these initiatives is to recognize the difference between untargeted effort and productive work. Our measures of success will continue to be the quality of thought and work we do for our clients, something that is sustainable only in a workplace that emphasizes productivity over the expectation of hours in the office and greater balance in pursuit of a long-term career. 
Business Standards & Practices 
As we have written to you in the past, we have spent enormous time and effort, as a firm, reviewing and improving our business standards and practices. In January 2011, we published the Report of the Business Standards Committee (BSC), which was the culmination of an extensive eight- month review encompassing every major business, region and activity of the firm. The report made 39 recommendations for change in the above areas. 
In January 2011, we established the BSC Implementation Oversight Group, which for the next two years was responsible for overseeing the implementation of each recommendation. By February 2013, all 39 recommendations had been fully implemented. 
In May 2013, we released another public report, the Business Standards Committee Impact Report, which discussed the changes we made as a result of the BSC implementation and how they impacted our firm. We identified three unifying themes across the 39 recommendations, which capture 
the areas of greatest change and impact on the firm:
(1) clients, and the higher standard of care we apply in serving them; (2) reputational sensitivity and awareness, and its importance in everything we do; and (3) the individual and collective accountability of our people. 
Most significantly, for all our employees, the experience of initiating, approving and executing a transaction for a client
at Goldman Sachs is now fundamentally different. This difference reflects significant changes to processes, business standards, documentation and transaction approvals, all of which impact our approach to decision making. 
Process matters and the BSC changes have led to our processes being more clear, comprehensive and consistent. Business standards reflect the heightened scrutiny we bring to our own actions and activities, the role we play as a large financial institution and the responsibilities we have to our clients and to global financial intermediation. Documentation supporting our processes is more standardized and organized around escalation procedures. Transaction approvals focus on the core goals of serving our clients’ long-term interests and protecting the firm’s reputation. Taken together, these changes result in better judgments and decision making, which are among the most important impacts emerging from the BSC. 
The work underlying the BSC is part of a much larger, ongoing commitment by the firm to be self-aware, to be open to change and to learn the right lessons from recent experiences. Going forward, we know we will inevitably make mistakes, but we commit to learn from them and respond in a way that meets the high expectations of our clients, shareholders, other stakeholders, regulators and the broader public. 
On our Web site, in addition to the two reports, you can view other relevant material, including a discussion on the impact of the Client and Business Standards Committee, an illustrated example of the life cycle of a client transaction and video excerpts from the Chairman’s Forum, which was a series of internal discussions led by senior management on how we conduct ourselves in serving our clients and protecting the firm’s reputation. 
Corporate Engagement 
In 2013, Goldman Sachs committed more than $200 million to philanthropic endeavors, including our tradition of strong engagement through Goldman Sachs Gives and expanding 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses to include new academic and non-profit partners. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
Goldman Sachs Gives is a donor-advised fund through
which participating managing directors (PMDs) of the firm can recommend grants to qualified non-profit organizations around the world. Since the inception of Goldman Sachs Gives, PMD compensation has been reduced by approximately
$1.2 billion to fund Goldman Sachs Gives, and approximately 15,000 grants totaling more than $720 million have been made to various organizations in 38 countries. Since the fund was created, more than $350 million has been granted to community organizations supporting veterans, poverty alleviation, medical research and other significant areas of need. In addition, more than $145 million has been granted
to approximately 180 colleges and universities to support financial aid. In 2013, more generally, approximately
$150 million was distributed through more than 4,500 individual grants. 
10,000 Small Businesses 
10,000 Small Businesses expanded its network of cities and partners to provide small businesses with the education, business services and capital they need to grow and create jobs. By year’s end,10,000 Small Businesses was operating in more than 20 sites in the U.S. and United Kingdom. In the U.S., we launched new sites in Philadelphia, Miami and Detroit. In addition, loans through the program began to be offered in Oregon, Washington, Tennessee, Virginia and Maine. In the fall, we announced a new national partnership that allows qualified small business owners anywhere in the U.S. to receive training at Babson College, one of the nation’s leading entrepreneurial schools. 
In the United Kingdom, we hosted the first gathering of 10,000 Small Businesses alumni from across the country, with more than 200 businesses attending. In conjunction with the event, academic program partners released a progress report on the graduating businesses to date showing that 66 percent of U.K. program participants had grown revenue and 77 percent of them had created jobs. 
10,000 Women 
2013 represented an important milestone for our 10,000 Women initiative. In December, the 10,000th woman entered the program and is expected to graduate in 2014. Since it was announced in 2008, this program has provided 10,000 underserved women entrepreneurs with a business and management education, access to mentors and networks, and links to capital.10,000 Women has drawn participants from more than 40 countries around the world. Delivered through a network of 90 academic and non-profit partners, 10,000 Women continues to yield promising results. More than 80 percent of surveyed graduates have increased revenues and more than 70 percent have added new jobs. 
We are focused on the next chapter of 10,000 Women
and recently announced a new partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to create the first-ever global finance facility dedicated exclusively to women-owned small and medium enterprises. Goldman Sachs Foundation, IFC and other investors will contribute up to $600 million to the facility, which will enable approximately 100,000 women entrepreneurs to access capital.10,000 Women remains committed to expanding business and management education to reach more high-potential women entrepreneurs around the world. Through the capital this partnership will raise, women entrepreneurs will have a much greater 
chance of reaching their full potential. 
Looking Ahead 
In our shareholder letter to you for 2006, we wrote that
“we are always cognizant that conditions can change quickly and in unforeseen ways...One of the worst things we could do, as a firm and as individuals, is to begin to believe that the laws of economics do not apply to us — that somehow markets aren’t cyclical.” 
Much of the last five years has been challenged by the cyclical downturn. We believe that the upcoming year may very well represent the progression into a stronger global economy. But, this has not been a passive exercise. The banking sector, especially in the U.S., is well capitalized; companies are operating with strong balance sheets; new ways to tap sources of energy are making U.S. manufacturing more competitive; the housing market is recovering and individuals have significantly reduced their debt. In addition, the tail 
risks in Europe and the political impasse in Washington, D.C. appear less likely than a year ago. Collectively, we have made a lot of progress. 
Of course, concerns about emerging economies, the effect of the Federal Reserve’s “taper,”and a host of other issues may challenge sentiment and complicate the recovery. As we look at the longer term fundamentals, however, we remain optimistic. 
For Goldman Sachs, our businesses are well positioned
and our client franchise is strong. We have taken important actions to manage efficiently our capital and cost structure. As a result, we are confident that we have achieved significant operating leverage for our shareholders, which will become only clearer with an improving economic environment. Our culture of teamwork and client focus
has never been more alive and vibrant and continues to define who we are and the work we do. We remain intent on learning from the experience of recent years but maintain a firm eye on the future to do our part to contribute to economic growth and opportunity. In the process, we
are confident that Goldman Sachs will produce significant value for our shareholders. 
"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2014,"For much of the last year, the global economy grew in fits and starts. In the United States, the economic recovery accelerated, evidenced by a steadily improving labor market. In Europe, challenges remained pronounced as growth 
was constrained. And in Asia, conditions slowed in both China and Japan. 
Different countries are clearly at different stages of the economic cycle, and the interconnectedness of these economies has made the transition to growth somewhat extended, choppy and, oftentimes, unpredictable. As a result, client activity was uneven across regions and asset classes. 
CEO confidence improved and merger and acquisition (M&A) volumes, in particular, rebounded. However, client volumes remained generally lower across our Institutional Client Services business. Despite uneven conditions, we are pleased to report that Goldman Sachs performed well, generating solid results for the year. Our performance benefited from the strength of our global client franchise, diversity of our largely institutional set of businesses and our culture of adaptability. 
For 2014, the firm produced net revenues of $34.53 billion and net earnings of $8.48 billion, a five percent increase from 
$8.04 billion of net earnings in 2013. Diluted earnings per common share were $17.07 compared with $15.46 for 2013. Our return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 11.2 percent. Book value per common share increased by seven percent during 2014 and has grown from $20.94
at the end of our first year as a public company in 1999 to $163.01, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15 percent over this period. Our capital management in 2014 reflected a prudent approach as our capital ratios continued to improve despite returning $6.5 billion to common shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. 
In our previous letter to shareholders, we discussed our focus on driving returns in a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we emphasized the need to protect our ability to provide significant upside to our shareholders as the economic cycle turns. 
The basis for meeting these goals rests on a strong financial profile and a sustained operating discipline. Our capital and liquidity levels help ensure stability during periods of market stress and position the firm to add value to our clients when they need it most. And, generating operating efficiency has bolstered our capacity to improve returns consistently, despite the lackluster operating environment of recent years. 
Against this backdrop, in this year’s letter, we would like to review our financial strength and the benefits embedded in our business model. We will also discuss our operating strategy in the recent environment and our major businesses with a focus on their competitive positions and opportunities for growth. Finally, we will update you on our efforts to protect and sustain our culture of client focus and teamwork, as well as the important progress being made across our corporate engagement initiatives. 
Financial Profile 
Since the end of 2007, our balance sheet is down by nearly one-quarter, while our common equity is up 85 percent. As a result, gross leverage has been cut by more than one-half. Our liquidity is approximately three times higher than the end of 2007, representing more than 20 percent of our total balance sheet at the end of 2014. And, less liquid level 3 financial assets are down nearly 
40 percent over this period. 
As represented in the charts on the right, our balance sheet measures have improved across the board. As a result, we have demonstrated our ability to meet or exceed the requirements of various regulations, including Basel III capital, the supplementary leverage ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio. 
The combination of a solid financial foundation and a focused operating strategy provides the ability to adapt quickly. Our balance sheet is less than one-half the size of the peer average.* And, our total staff level is less than 20 percent of the peer average. We are an institutional client firm, with a broad range of services. Our retail clients are largely high-net-worth individuals, with an average account size of more than $40 million. In short, we are not simple, but we are simpler. 
Our strong and stable financial footing has given us the wherewithal to stay committed to our core set of businesses over the cycle. We work with tens of thousands of companies, institutions, investing entities, governments and high-net-worth individuals around the world. 
Partly because we have remained focused on executing our strategy through our core businesses, we have grown our client franchise over the last several years. Institutional Client Services, for example, has seen an approximately 10 percent increase in active clients since 2010. 
Our mix of businesses reflects the diverse needs of our clients. And, the products and services we provide produce a diverse and balanced revenue stream. 
In addition to better revenue stability, we have benefited from a variable cost structure. We have long had a “pay for performance” culture. The bottom chart depicts the strong correlation between the firm’s performance and its levels of compensation and benefits expense. 
To us, this graph underscores the value of a true partnership culture. Culture is not preordained or guaranteed in perpetuity. Since we became a public company, we have invested an enormous amount of time and resources to sustain our 
culture. Rigorous partner selection and aligning compensation with long-term performance reinforce an ethos of long-term ownership. 
The combination of a diverse set of businesses, effective risk management and a “pay for performance” culture has produced a track record of lower earnings volatility than our peers. From 2005 through 2014, Goldman Sachs’ net earnings to common volatility averaged roughly 50 percent vs. 130 percent for peers. 
Our relative earnings stability is critical to our ability to outperform throughout the cycle. We performed when conditions were challenged and we also performed when the environment was more favorable. 
Against the backdrop of relatively consistent revenues, we have performed well across several key metrics. 
Compared to 2012, earnings per share is 21 percent higher, book value per share is 13 percent higher and our common stock dividends per share have grown 27 percent. Over this three-year period, we have returned $16 billion via share repurchases, while maintaining stronger capital ratios. 
Net revenues were roughly flat over the past three years. But, that’s not the story. Since 2012, we undertook several strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations, including higher capital requirements. We sold a majority stake 
in both our Americas reinsurance business and our European insurance business — and we liquidated our investment
in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. We also sold our hedge fund administration business and our 
REDI platform. 
In 2012, these businesses and investments produced $2.3 billion in net revenues. So, on a “like-for-like” basis, net revenues in 2014 were about $2.7 billion higher than 2012. Investment Management and Investment Banking contributed $2.4 billion to this growth. 
We have grown revenues while managing expenses and capital. Our average compensation and benefits to net revenues ratio from 2009 through 2014 was more than 900 basis points lower than it was from 2000 through 2007, despite a tougher revenue environment. 
We have been equally focused on capital efficiency. We have developed technology to help inform our capital allocation decisions. The combination of our profitability and risk management allowed us to pay out roughly 70 percent 
of our net earnings to common shareholders since the beginning of 2009 and basic share count has declined by
17 percent since the end of that year. Since the end of 1999, our basic share count is seven percent lower, while our common equity is actually more than seven times higher. 
These efforts not only protected near-term returns, they have also positioned the firm to benefit from operating leverage when the environment improves. 
As the cycle turns, our strategic focus shifts to growing revenues and the ability to deliver greater operating leverage to our shareholders through margin expansion. In that vein, we want to review our businesses and opportunities. 
Investment Banking 
In Investment Banking, we have the preeminent client franchise. We advised on more than $1 trillion of announced transactions last year, the highest level since 2007. We have maintained a leading market share over the last 25 years. We maintained our market position when M&A activity was dominated by technology in 1999, by financials in 2008
and by natural resources in 2014. 
And, we have maintained our position when volumes were low and when they were higher. Our performance carries through to different industries, market environments and regions. Our success is rooted in decades of investment, consistency of coverage and a broad client franchise by both industry and geography. 
We see a number of growth opportunities on the horizon. Global economic growth continues to be the biggest driver of the opportunity set. In 2014, global M&A volume as a percentage of market capitalization was roughly 100 basis points below the 15-year average. Returning to the historical average would drive $630 billion of incremental M&A volume. 
We are particularly well-positioned for growth in cross-border activity given our global footprint. And, we believe that the demand for funding and capital remains highly correlated to economic growth and broader corporate activity. 
Institutional Client Services 
In Institutional Client Services, we benefit from having
both a leading fixed income franchise and a leading equities franchise. And, we have a global footprint. While having a diversified mix of businesses supports revenue stability, it is also crucial to driving stable and attractive margins. We also 
have a balance of activities and products that are “high” capital and “low” capital intensive. 
Institutional Client Services is one of our most dynamic businesses. It has always been in a state of evolution. The introduction of new regulations has accelerated the evolution in certain areas, including market structure. As a consequence, the value placed on adaptability and operational excellence has significantly grown. 
Regulatory requirements and technological investments have raised the barriers to entry higher than at any other time in recent history. This is an expensive business to be in if you don’t have the market share and scale. Consider the numerous business exits that have been announced by our peers, as they reassess their competitive positioning and relative returns. 
Longer term, we believe that the value being placed on liquidity provisioning is likely to grow, especially in the context of a more rational marketplace. This provides an opportunity for market share expansion for those firms with strong, global and stable client franchises. Technological innovation will continue to be important and may increasingly become a differentiator amongst competitors and a potential driver of new or incremental revenues. Going forward, we believe that these requirements will likely lead to only a handful of players being able to effectively compete on 
a global basis. 
Investing & Lending 
Another core part of our mission and strategy is to provide promising businesses with the capital they need to grow. Sometimes that means offering a loan and, other times,
it means making an equity investment. We are able to leverage our global investor network and invest alongside these clients in industries that create jobs and promote economic growth. 
These loans and commitments include major infrastructure projects, clean energy and technology companies, and cutting-edge healthcare businesses. Including our own commitments, during 2014 we closed on more than 
$15 billion of debt and equity capital raised in private equity and credit funds.* 
Our ability to provide equity capital has been important to growing companies. We have a diversified portfolio of

classes ranked by Morningstar. 
companies which helps drive strong performance for
both our co-investors and shareholders. For example, between 2012 and 2014, our private equity and credit funds distributed more than $40 billion. And generally, our co-investors are clients of the firm, whether it is with Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services or Investment Management. 
We will continue to invest and grow our existing investment strategies. At the same time, we will seek growth in new regions and across new strategies. 
Lending has become an increasingly important part of our strategy as it relates to corporate, real estate and private wealth clients. 
Our private wealth commitments and lending portfolio has been a particular source of significant growth. The portfolio benefits from both the level of collateralization and the fact that borrower credit quality for our average private wealth client is extremely high. 
We see an opportunity to continue to grow our lending activities in ways that are accretive to current returns. Since 2012, we’ve made great strides in this business, growing lending by roughly 100 percent. As we grow, we maintain our same conservative and rigorous risk management policies to ensure quality and prudence. 
Investment Management 
We have made significant progress in our Investment Management business over the last few years. Assets under supervision have grown 32 percent since 2011 to nearly $1.2 trillion at the end of 2014. Still, we are only the 10th-largest asset manager globally, so there is significant room for growth. Within fixed income products, we are approximately 40 percent of the size of the largest peer. Within equities products, we are about one-quarter of the size of our largest competitor. And for alternatives, we are approximately two-thirds the size of the largest peer. 
We remain focused on delivering strong performance for clients, which has already driven meaningful growth. At the end of last year, 83 percent of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a 3-year basis, and 75 percent ranked in the top two quartiles on a 5-year basis.** In 2014, Investment Management attracted over $85 billion in fee-based assets organically. 
We also see attractive opportunities to expand our private wealth management platform. Among the distinguishing characteristics of this franchise is its connectivity to our investment banking efforts, which serves as an important sourcing mechanism. For example, the opportunity for our private wealth clients to invest in Facebook and Uber originated from a banking relationship. 
We continue to invest in long-term strategic initiatives, like advisory, defined contribution, insurance and private banking. We have also looked for accretive acquisitions, having recently bought Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management’s stable value business and Dwight Asset Management. Performing for our clients and expanding our product offerings will help support continued growth going forward. 
Our People 
This year, we marked our 145th anniversary as a firm. Over that time, our people and culture have helped define our success. We place a huge priority on preserving and enhancing a tangible environment of teamwork, client focus and long-term stewardship. We are proud that these attributes are as strong and vibrant as ever. 
In terms of recruiting, in 2014, nearly 270,000 applicants applied for 8,300 positions. And, of those receiving offers, nearly 90 percent chose to come to Goldman Sachs. 
In November 2014, we announced our newest class of 78 partners. The rigor and focus surrounding this biennial process is intense and that investment continues to pay dividends. The partnership is vital to helping ensure a real sense of long-term ownership. 
For all of our people, we continue to invest in a workplace environment, including programs and training, which has consistently earned the firm recognition as one of the most attractive places to work. 
In 2014, we were proud to be named as one of Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Goldman Sachs is one of only five companies to be recognized every year that the Great Place to Work Institute has issued its list since 1984. And for nine consecutive years, the firm has been named to Working Mother magazine’s “100 Best Companies,” which ranks companies with the best programs that support working parents. 
Few people have contributed more to our culture and generations of leaders at Goldman Sachs than John Whitehead. Earlier this year, John passed away. We honor his achievements and contributions in service to his country and our firm. John was a man of enormous grace and integrity, and his legacy will endure in the institutions he led and in the lives of those he cared for and mentored. We highlight John’s extraordinary contributions later in 
the Annual Report. 
Our Board of Directors 
We were also deeply sad to lose our former lead director, Jim Schiro, to cancer. Jim joined our Board of Directors in May 2009, and was elected lead director and named chair of the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Public Responsibilities Committee in May 2012. 
Jim was an outstanding Board member and an exceptional individual who made an invaluable contribution to our firm and to all those who worked with him. We will remember him for his unfailing commitment to Goldman Sachs and to our shareholders and for the example he set as a leader and mentor. 
He lived his life to make a difference and the mark he has left on institutions and people is powerful. Jim was methodical and careful, yet expansive and philosophical. He understood the black and white of the numbers better than anyone, but appreciated the human element better than most. 
For a lot of his tenure on our Board, our firm faced tough scrutiny. He gave us the confidence to be proactive and to deal forthrightly with the issues we were confronting. He asked probing questions that always got to the heart of the matter. Jim had an enormous impact on Goldman Sachs, and on our leadership team. He made us a better company, and, for all those he worked with, better people. 
Following Jim’s retirement, Adebayo Ogunlesi was appointed lead director and chair of the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Public Responsibilities Committee. 
Adebayo is the managing partner and chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm that invests worldwide in infrastructure assets. Previously, he held various positions at Credit Suisse Investment Bank (and predecessor firms), including as executive vice chairman and head of global investment banking. Adebayo’s extensive 
knowledge of finance and global capital markets provides valuable insight and direction for our Board. 
After 12 years of distinguished service, Claes Dahlbäck decided to retire from the Goldman Sachs Board of Directors this coming May. 
Claes’ global experience, independent and wise judgment and quiet leadershisp made him an invaluable voice on our Board. His deep understanding of global markets, our business and our culture has benefited the firm enormously. 
We thank him for his unfailing commitment to our shareholders and our people. 
We are pleased to announce two additions to our Board of Directors, Mark Flaherty and Mark Winkelman. 
Mark Flaherty has more than 20 years of experience in investment management. He served as vice chairman of Wellington Management Company before retiring in 2012. Previously, he was director of the company’s global investment services from 2002 to 2012, and served as partner and senior vice president from 2001 to 2012. 
Mark Winkelman currently serves on the Board of Directors of Anheuser-Busch InBev. From 2006 to 2008, he served as operating partner of J.C. Flowers & Co. Previously, Mark held several leadership positions at Goldman Sachs before retiring from the firm in 1994, including co-head of the Fixed Income Division. During the course of his career, Mark has demonstrated exceptional judgment, market knowledge and risk management. 
We know that our Board, our shareholders and our people will benefit from their deep and varied understanding of economies, global markets and the financial
services industry. 
Corporate Engagement 
Throughout the year, Goldman Sachs continued to engage on broader public policy matters that have the potential to spur economic growth and stability. In June, we convened the North American Energy Summit to discuss how to maximize the economic benefits of North American energy resources through enhanced regional integration and cooperation. Policymakers and corporate and NGO leaders examined the impact of relevant geopolitical, economic and environmental factors around the enormous energy opportunity that will continue to have a profound influence on the global economy. 
We hosted the China-U.S. CEO Bilateral Investment Dialogue in Beijing and later in New York, bringing CEOs of some of the largest Chinese and U.S. companies together with policymakers to discuss how to encourage more cross-border trade and investment. Our collective futures are dependent on the relationship between the U.S. and China, and there’s nothing more important to that relationship than advancing the mechanisms for more economic activity between these two countries. 
And, as explained below, we attended various 10,000
Small Businesses graduations across the U.S. At each event, whether it was in Detroit, Los Angeles or Miami,
we saw how the combined impact from know-how and confidence can advance people and the local economy. And, with each entrepreneur we meet through 10,000 Women, we recognized how a practical business education and, increasingly, effective access to capital can transform a small business and consequently a family and a community. 
10,000 Small Businesses 
10,000 Small Businesses continued to help small business owners grow and create jobs through access to business and management education, business services and capital. By year’s end, 10,000 Small Businesses was operating in
23 sites in the U.S. and U.K. and had served over 4,000 entrepreneurs. In the U.S., we launched a new site in Dallas/ Fort Worth as well as the inaugural cohort of a new national partnership that allows qualified small business owners from across the U.S. to receive training both online and at Babson College. This innovative model has extended the reach of 10,000 Small Businesses to business owners in 45 states across the U.S. 
Stimulating Small Businesses Growth, a report released
in 2014 from lead academic partner Babson College, demonstrates the impact of the program. Within six months of graduating, 64 percent of U.S. participants have reported increasing their revenues and 45 percent reported creating net new jobs. We are proud that the program maintains a 99 percent graduation rate and graduates have developed 
a strong marketplace among themselves, as 80 percent of participants have done some form of business with another graduate. 
10,000 Women 
10,000 Women launched an important new partnership in 2014 with International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to create the first-ever global 
finance facility dedicated exclusively to women-owned small- and medium-sized enterprises. The facility is a $600 million effort to enable approximately 100,000 women entrepreneurs to access capital. Since its launch, seven transactions in seven countries, including China, Brazil and Kenya, have been closed, representing over $150 million in commitments. 
10,000 Women remains committed to providing a business and management education, mentoring and networking to high-potential women entrepreneurs around the world. Since it was announced in 2008, the initiative has reached more than 10,000 women entrepreneurs from over 40 countries around the world. Delivered through a network of 90 academic and nonprofit partners, 10,000 Women continues to yield promising results. Nearly 70 percent of surveyed graduates have increased revenues and 60 percent have added new jobs. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
Goldman Sachs Gives is a donor-advised fund through which participating managing directors (PMDs) of the firm can recommend grants to qualified nonprofit organizations around the world. In 2014, PMD compensation was reduced by approximately $157 million related to Goldman Sachs Gives, $137 million of which was a charitable contribution in 2014, and 4,400 grants totaling more than $146 million were made to nonprofit organizations assisting underserved people and communities across a range of areas. Since the Goldman Sachs Gives’ launch in 2010, approximately 19,000 grants totaling more than $860 million have been made to various nonprofits in 45 countries. 
A continuing focus for Goldman Sachs Gives is its support of need-based financial aid to more than 200 colleges and universities globally to ensure students are able to complete their college degrees. In particular, a number of the firm’s partners, including all of the U.S.-based members of our Management Committee, recently made individual Goldman Sachs Gives’ grant recommendations to support LaGuardia Community College, based in Queens, New York. These grants represent the largest private donation in the school’s history. In addition, the partners’ recommendations created the Goldman Sachs Community College Fund to provide need-based financial aid to additional community colleges around the country. 
As part of the firm’s commitment to hire and retain veterans, and support the military community, Goldman Sachs Gives remains focused on making grants to honor service and 
veterans. Demonstrating Goldman Sachs Gives’ scope, during 2014, it supported nonprofit activities in 29 countries — from building libraries in Cambodia, to fighting Ebola in Africa, to raising awareness of hunger issues in India, and advancing cancer research in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
Looking Ahead 
The global economic recovery remains fragile and geo- political risk in Europe and the Middle East will continue to have varying degrees of influence on market sentiment. 
Still, conditions at this point are more conducive for our set of businesses than in recent years. Job growth in the U.S. is strong and prospects for above trend GDP growth are good. CEO confidence is up and consumer sentiment is generally better. More than six years after the financial crisis, we are finally seeing dispersion in central bank policies, which, over time, may contribute to more normalized markets and levels of volatility. 
Over the last few years, we have protected and expanded our client franchise across our major businesses. Our client franchise today is as strong as ever. We have transformed the financial profile of the firm. We have been proactive in managing our cost structure. We have significantly adjusted both compensation levels and fixed expenses. 
We have been judicious managers of capital. We have maintained our culture of client service and partnership. We remain the employer of choice in our industry. 
Taken together, we are confident that we have positioned the firm to provide operating leverage for our shareholders as the economy and opportunity set improves. 
"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2015,"A s many of you know first hand, 2015 was a tale of two halves: the first half of the year featured a strong operating environment, but headwinds emerged, particularly during the second half, and these headwinds persisted into early 2016. 
The first two quarters of 2015 were marked by heightened demand from our corporate clients for strategic advice and financings, strong client activity across our Equities franchise and growing demand from our Investment Management clients for our products and services. These factors culminated in record first-half results in Investment Banking and Investment Management, as well as the best first-half performance for Equities in six years. 
As the year progressed, increasing concerns about China, the first rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve in nearly a decade, slowing global growth and falling commodity prices — especially in oil — began to emerge. We faced these headwinds, and lower client activity across many of our businesses suggested that our clients and peers also faced their share of challenges. 
In addition to the impact of the operating environment, our 2015 financial performance was negatively affected by the resolution of our most significant outstanding legal exposure relating to our securitization, underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) from 2005 to 2007. In January 2016, we announced an agreement in principle with the RMBS Working Group,* 
under which we will pay a $2.39 billion civil monetary penalty, make $875 million in cash payments and provide $1.80 billion in consumer relief. 
Despite these factors, our strong and diversified client franchise allowed us to produce relatively stable net revenues in 2015. The firm generated net revenues of $33.82 billion, marking our fourth consecutive year of roughly $34 billion in net revenues. Net earnings were $6.08 billion and diluted earnings per common share were $12.14. Return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 7.4 percent for 2015, which would have been 3.8 percentage points higher excluding the provisions we recorded during the year related to the RMBS Working Group settlement. 
In this year’s letter to our shareholders, we cover a wide array of topics, including an overview of our financial profile, a review of our strong and diverse client franchise, as well as our thoughts on the forward outlook, particularly how we are thinking about navigating these uncertain times. 
Financial Profile 
As we manage our financial profile, our strategy is predicated on carefully delineating between structural and cyclical factors affecting our businesses. Accordingly, in 2015, we continued to adjust our franchise to address structural changes in the regulatory environment, and
we will continue to do so as needed. From a cyclical perspective, it certainly feels like the cycle has been prolonged, particularly as interest rates in many parts
of the world remain at — or even below — zero, and growth and deflation concerns, among other worries, have persisted. 
It is important to remember that cycles do turn, even if the timing of such inflections may be difficult to predict. As we look to deliver value to our shareholders over the 
long term, our focus continues to be on managing to both the structural and cyclical forces we see at play, while remaining flexible enough to capture future growth opportunities. 
Our efforts in this regard have yielded solid results. Over the past four years, we have diversified our franchise while holding net revenues steady. We have increased our capital and liquidity, decreased our risk, and have stayed focused on efficiently and prudently managing our resources — all while helping our clients to execute their long-term goals and strategic objectives. Over the same four-year period, we returned approximately $25 billion in capital to our shareholders, increased dividends per common share by 44 percent and reduced our basic share count by 14 percent. 
In response to structural changes resulting from new regulations, since the end of 2007, we have reduced our balance sheet by approximately one-quarter, while nearly doubling common shareholders’ equity — cutting gross leverage by more than 60 percent — and tripling our liquidity position to almost $200 billion. These measures have strengthened our long-term financial safety and soundness. 
Also as a result of structural changes, we have embraced opportunities to sell businesses and investments that were not core to our client franchise and were no longer the best use of shareholder capital relative to the returns. 
The loss in net revenues due to these sales has been offset by growth in our Investment Banking and Investment Management businesses. Last year, these two businesses accounted for 39 percent of our net revenues, compared to only 30 percent in 2012. Investment Banking was approximately one-half the size of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution (FICC) four years ago; today, our business mix is more balanced. 
This does not mean we are moving away from FICC. Rather, we remain committed to meeting the needs of our clients, while managing to structural and cyclical headwinds. For example, we have reduced risk-weighted assets within FICC significantly over the past four years, largely in response to structural changes resulting from new regulations. 
On the cost side, we have continued to find ways to improve our operating efficiency. Headcount across
the firm is up 11 percent over the last four years, largely to meet regulatory compliance needs. However, through a combination of shifting to a greater percentage of junior employees and relocating some of our footprint to lower-cost locations, we have managed our
expenses well. 
More specifically, we have increased the number of analysts, associates and vice presidents at the firm by
17 percent since the beginning of 2012, while our partner and managing director populations have decreased by two percent. Approximately 25 percent of our total staff is now in lower-cost locations such as Salt Lake City, Dallas, Irving, Warsaw, Singapore and Bengaluru. As
a result, while total staff levels are up over the four-year period, overall compensation and benefits expenses
have declined by approximately $270 million. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue ways to be more cost effective by assessing our expense structure 
while ensuring we meet the needs of our clients. Whether we are adjusting to structural or cyclical dynamics, we will carefully balance our expense management efforts against our ability to capture future market share and growth opportunities. 
Investment Banking 
Our leading Investment Banking franchise allowed us to capture significant market share in 2015. The business achieved its second-highest net revenues in 2015, driven by a strong environment for mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Industry-wide volumes for announced M&A transactions increased by more than 45 percent in 2015, while the firm’s volumes increased by approximately 
80 percent. We ended the year ranked first in global announced and completed M&A, with completed M&A volumes that were more than $350 billion higher than our next-closest competitor — a record gap since the firm went public. 
By most measures, 2015 was a robust year for
M&A. However, volumes as a percentage of market capitalization are still below prior-cycle peak levels.
We see this as a sign that there is still some room to run for M&A activity, particularly when equity markets show signs of sustained stabilization. We also see consolidation opportunities in sectors such as industrials, energy, mining, food, media and telecommunications. 
While total underwriting revenues declined in 2015,
we performed relatively well in the context of softer equity and debt markets in the second half of the year. We finished 2015 ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings. Similar to the dynamics we see in the M&A market, we believe there may be pent-up demand among our corporate clients to tap into public equity markets when conditions improve, particularly given that private financing conditions have generally tightened. A decline in debt underwriting net revenues in 2015 was largely due to 
a drop in leveraged finance activity. 
Institutional Client Services 
In the wake of balance sheet restructurings in the
U.S. and elsewhere, we remain one of the few financial institutions with leading global franchises in both FICC and Equities. We view this as critical to the long-term success of our Institutional Client Services business.
We expect our ability to offer our clients a broad suite of services to be a key competitive advantage in the years ahead. 
Over the course of 2015, within FICC, lower levels
of client activity in credit and mortgage products were partly offset by stronger client activity and a more favorable backdrop for macro products, particularly in interest rates and currencies. 
Equities benefitted from a better market environment, posting solid results for the year. Clients continued to place significant value on the integration of our various services across Equities — electronic, cash, derivatives and prime brokerage — as well as our global footprint, all of which was reflected in our performance in 
these areas. 
Moving forward, addressing structural changes in our Institutional Client Services businesses, such as risk- based capital rules, will remain a central focus for our management team. At the same time, we will look for ways to advance our franchise in the evolving landscape. Competitor retrenchments in the wake of structural developments should provide an opportunity for us to capture market share over the longer term. 
As it pertains to cyclical trends in Institutional Client Services, we continue to carefully scale our business relative to the environment, but have also chosen to remain targeted in our efforts. Our business is highly correlated to economic growth, and when a better opportunity set eventually presents itself — and it will — our strong, deep and broad client franchise should position us well to respond. 
Investing & Lending 
Our Investing & Lending business enhances and expands our client relationships. It creates synergies for our broader client franchise because it enables us to extend credit or to invest alongside our clients. From a broader perspective, by participating in Investing & Lending in a disciplined manner, we engage in the capital allocation process, which allows corporates and individuals to put capital to work to generate broader economic growth. 
Over the past several years, the composition of Investing & Lending has changed significantly. Since the beginning of 2012, we have seen lending increase threefold, primarily to private wealth management and corporate clients. Our corporate loan portfolio is well diversified, with no one sector representing more than one-quarter
of the portfolio. Our private equity portfolio similarly reflects the diversity of our global client franchise, comprising more than 800 different investments globally across a broad spectrum of industries. In some cases, we invest in private companies alongside our clients. In other cases, we invest in public equity or in real estate, or we deploy capital to seed new funds. 
While the nature of our investing may change over time due to regulatory changes, and net revenues can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on price movements, we evaluate the performance of our Investing & Lending portfolio over many years. On that basis, these activities have been strong contributors to returns over the last four years. 
Investment Management 
Our Investment Management business is one of only
a few such franchises globally that can meet the needs
of a broad spectrum of clients across many products and regions. We serve investors of all types, including retirees in need of mutual funds, entrepreneurs who have sold their companies and pension fund managers who need help with asset allocation. With this in mind, we built 
our business to be global, broad and deep, and to focus on delivering consistent returns over time. We believe that our emphasis on providing the best possible advice, products and services will help us outperform the industry over time. 
Executing on this strategy, we have experienced significant growth in our business over the past several years. We ended 2015 with a record $1.25 trillion in assets under supervision, up from $895 billion at the start of 2012. This growth has been the direct result
of robust net inflows, driven in part from market share gains, as clients place increasing value on asset managers like us that offer a broad array of products and services. In 2015, our $53 billion in organic, long-term net inflows outperformed our largest active management peers.
In some areas of asset management, we are still small relative to the market leader. As we look ahead, this means we see opportunity to grow substantially — both by continuing to gain market share in our incumbent businesses and by expanding into new ones. 
Our growth in assets under supervision has also come from new products and several strategic acquisitions. We have launched a handful of new products that
have added more than $50 billion to our assets under supervision over the past four years. Our Active Beta, Unconstrained Fixed Income and Income Oriented Strategies funds, for example, offer our clients compelling new opportunities. 
What’s more, eight acquisitions since the beginning
of 2012 have driven more than $70 billion in inflows. These acquisitions have added important new capabilities, filled gaps in our asset management offering and added scale to our current business. For example, in 2015,
we acquired Imprint Capital Advisors, a dedicated environmental, social and governance investment advisor, strengthening our ability to help our clients address these considerations in their portfolios.
Looking to build upon these efforts, we will continue 
to evaluate targeted strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. 
Impact Investing 
Our firm is committed to fostering meaningful change
in the global economy, and in the communities in which we live and work, both through our core businesses, and by engaging in other activities that leverage our expertise to promote economic progress. This means, among other things, helping new enterprises succeed and grow by investing in entrepreneurs, and helping to finance different types of projects across the globe, such as those that can improve living standards within traditionally underserved communities. It also means being mindful of the environment’s importance, not only to society as
a whole, but also to economic growth, and driving that core belief through our work with our clients and within the management of our own operations. 
Urban Investment Group 
We have a long history of innovative impact investing through our Urban Investment Group (UIG). Since 2001, UIG has committed more than $4.9 billion to underserved U.S. communities, facilitating the creation and preservation of over 20,000 housing units — the majority of which are affordable for low- to middle- income families — as well as more than 1.9 million square feet of community space and over 6 million square feet of commercial, retail and industrial facilities. We work with local stakeholders from the nonprofit, for-profit and public sectors, focusing on community and economic development. We have also been a pioneer in the creation of “social impact bonds,” which are financial instruments that leverage private investments 
to support high-impact social programs. In fact, we were involved in four of the eight social impact bond financings that have been launched in the U.S. 
Environmental Impact 
We were among the first global financial institutions
to acknowledge the scale and urgency of the challenges posed by climate change when we established our Environmental Policy Framework in 2005. A decade later, we have continued to build on our commitment
to environmental stewardship, making it a part of our core mission to deploy financial solutions and drive market opportunities that help to address climate change. Specifically, to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, last year we updated our Environmental Policy Framework to include an increased target of $150 billion in clean energy financings and investments by 2025, up from an earlier target of $40 billion. Finally, we continue to be mindful of our own operational impact on the environment, pledging to be carbon neutral from
2015 onwards and to target 100 percent renewable power to meet our global electricity needs by 2020. 
10,000 Women 
Since its launch, this initiative has provided more
than 10,000 women from across 56 countries — including Afghanistan, Egypt, Rwanda, Brazil, India and China — with business and management education, mentoring and networking, and access to capital. After completing the program, nearly 70 percent of surveyed graduates have increased their revenue, 60 percent have added new jobs and most have doubled the size of their workforces. What’s also encouraging is the “multiplier effect”: 90 percent of our graduates have “paid it forward” by mentoring and teaching business skills 
to other women in their communities. 
In 2014, The Goldman Sachs Foundation and International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, launched the first-ever global finance facility dedicated exclusively to women-owned small- and medium-sized enterprises. To date, the facility has made more than $400 million in commitments to banks in 14 countries, enabling women from Kenya to China
to Laos to access capital and grow their businesses. In 
2015, President Obama announced a $100 million commitment by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, demonstrating how the facility is catalyzing new investments from both the public and private sectors in women-owned enterprises globally. 
10,000 Small Businesses 
Designed to help small businesses grow and create jobs by providing entrepreneurs with a practical business education and access to capital, 10,000 Small Businesses has served more than 6,000 small business owners at 
30 sites across the U.S. and the U.K. This includes our commitment of more than $180 million to 28 capital partners that have lent over $120 million to date, resulting in more than 750 loans to small businesses. The program has maintained a 99 percent graduation rate, with more than 75 percent of surveyed participants increasing their revenues, and nearly 60 percent generating new jobs within 18 months of graduation. 
Focus on Technology 
Technology underpins everything we do. In fact, approximately one quarter of our total staff works in technology, which demonstrates just how critical it has become to our strategy in several ways. 
First and foremost, technology enhances the overall experience and quality of service we are able to
provide to our clients. It allows us to execute transactions more quickly and seamlessly, to provide better market analytics, data and other information, and to communicate faster and more efficiently. 
Second, technology helps us to operate more efficiently as a firm. For example, relying more on open source and cloud strategies has helped us reduce vendor expenses for our workplace application infrastructure products and market data sources. 
Third, technology helps us meet new regulatory requirements, such as Dodd-Frank implementation and Basel III provisions. We have hired more technology 
staff to build and adapt software and to automate such processes, which would have otherwise been highly manual and substantially more time intensive. Once
we have fully embedded technology solutions for our regulatory needs, we should be able to reduce or redirect resources to support other areas of our firm. 
Finally, the technology we create or develop inside of Goldman Sachs can be a stand-alone product. We have
a successful track record in this regard, with Tradeweb, DirectEdge and Markit as examples of platforms we developed or participated in creating, and then monetized. Today, new platforms such as Symphony and Marquee are helping our clients communicate, manage risk and better analyze their investments. Symphony is an independent company built around core technology developed and contributed by Goldman Sachs. For Marquee, we built a common application development platform, allowing our businesses to create sophisticated tools that deliver cutting-edge capabilities to our institutional investing clients. 
Our People 
In a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry like ours, technology is clearly a critical differentiator. Yet the quality of our talent remains a vital competitive advantage for us — if not the vital competitive advantage we maintain. 
Ours is a business of relationships. This is the case
not only in our work with clients, but also here within the firm. To that end, Goldman Sachs goes to great lengths to employ the best people with a wide range of experience and backgrounds. In 2015, we extended offers to 4 percent of applicants for open positions, and more than 80 percent of those offered roles chose to join the firm. 
As we compete for talent not only with other financial firms, but also across other industries, particularly in technology, we strive to remain a place where top talent aspires to work. We believe our time-tested culture of 
client service, teamwork and excellence sets us
apart in this regard, and we find that people come
to Goldman Sachs because the nature of our work is fundamentally consequential to the world around them. By helping to allocate capital, manage risk and provide products, services and advice to a broad array of clients, Goldman Sachs plays a vital role in the economy
across industries and regions, something that is inherently appealing to people who want to affect positive outcomes. 
With this in mind, we are proud that we were once again recognized as an employer of choice across
a wide variety of metrics on Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” and “Most Admired Companies.” We were also pleased to again be named as one of Working Mother magazine’s “100 Best Companies” and “Best Companies for Multicultural Women.” 
Attracting and retaining the highest-caliber talent also means that we must invest in our people early on in their careers — the best of whom will become the next generation of leadership at the firm. Building off the learnings of our biennial People Survey, last year we unveiled a set of new initiatives designed to support junior employees, giving them more flexibility and greater exposure to our client franchise. In 2015, we also selected our newest class of managing directors. In addition to hailing from more than 40 countries, 
40 percent of the class of 2015 started at the firm as analysts, a testament to our emphasis on talent development and retention for the long haul. 
Looking Ahead 
As we look ahead, the question that is top of mind not only to our clients, but also to Goldman Sachs, is: how do we think about navigating these uncertain times? 
Since the second half of 2015, concerns about global economic growth, investor sentiment, and regulatory and monetary policy — in tandem with other 
macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics — have
made for pervasive uncertainty. Slowing growth in China, a presidential election in the U.S., a referendum in the U.K. about its future in the European Union, volatility
in the markets and regions consumed by conflict, to name a few, are examples of issues that are naturally generating unease. Other fundamental questions being raised — from whether technology is permanently displacing jobs to whether monetary policy has reached its limits in affecting economic outcomes — have gone from esoteric to mainstream. 
At Goldman Sachs, we grapple with these questions day in and day out. As managers of risk, we do our best to understand them, and to prepare our clients and our firm for even low-probability but highly consequential scenarios. This is why we worry about deflationary pressures, or liquidity problems in financial markets as a result of new regulations, or how China will manage its transition from an infrastructure-driven to a consumer-driven economy. It’s why we keep a close eye on emerging markets, particularly those that lack diversification and are heavily exposed to commodity exports, where a prolonged supply overhang could negatively affect prices for some time to come. 
When our clients confront these or other challenges,
we use our institutional resources to help them navigate the choppy waters, and we regularly consider how these scenarios and other tail-risk events could directly affect our firm. 
While we must consistently try to “see around corners” to anticipate problems, we also see plenty of reasons
for optimism. We see the U.S. nearing full employment, signs of modest inflation and some stabilization in equity and commodity markets. We don’t see how a world 
of zero or negative interest rates could possibly be the “new normal.” Moreover, we view China’s slower rate of economic growth as still substantial, particularly given that it is now the world’s second-largest economy. We 
see room for continued fiscal policy expansion in some economies, and options for monetary policy if meaningful growth proves elusive. 
We can’t forecast every outcome, and we expect the near-term environment to prove challenging. This is why we focus on issues such as tight cost controls, and consistently assess our own strategic areas of focus.
Yet we find ourselves generally optimistic about the longer term. By staying true to our strategic focus, while adapting quickly to structural and cyclical factors, and maintaining our focus on meeting the needs of new and existing clients, we strive to continue to deliver on our long history of providing our shareholders with best- in-class returns. 
"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2016,"We started 2016 with concerns about global economic growth, leading some to comment that the world was headed into a recession. While those concerns moderated in the second quarter and the global economic outlook improved
in the second half, other concerns drew to the forefront. Few predicted with conviction the outcome of the United Kingdom’s referendum on remaining a part of the European Union, the results of the presidential election in the United States or the markets’ reactions to either event. 

In last year’s letter, we characterized 2015 as a “tale of two halves.” That was certainly true again in 2016, but in reverse order. As our clients — and by extension, the firm — navigated the challenging operating environment in the first half, our net revenues declined by 28 percent year over year for the period, with the majority of that decline occurring in the first quarter. As conditions improved in the second half, so did client sentiment. As a result, net revenues increased by nearly 16 percent year over year in the second half, including two consecutive quarters of more than 11 percent annualized return on average common shareholders’ equity. 
The events of the past year are a stark reminder of how quickly expectations and conditions can change, and
of the importance for us to be nimble and to concentrate on the things we can control. Despite the difficult start to the year, we remained focused on our clients and operating efficiently, without surrendering the ability 
to pursue potential opportunities. For the full year, the firm generated net revenues of $30.6 billion, net earnings of $7.4 billion and diluted earnings per common share of $16.29. Our return on average common shareholders’ equity was 9.4 percent. 
Despite our focus on cost discipline, we did not stop investing in our franchise — including investments
in technology, attracting and retaining top talent, and seeking new business opportunities, including our efforts to expand our lending footprint, most notably through Goldman Sachs Bank USA. We believe that our consistent investment in our franchise positioned us to serve our clients when activity increased in the back half of 2016. 
Managing the firm with discipline while preserving optionality for upside can be a difficult balancing act. We do not hold preconceived expectations for certain outcomes, but rather approach our own operations with the same mindset we do when helping our clients. We spend a great deal of time thinking about and preparing for downside scenarios, but we are always cognizant that the economy, markets and sentiment could break to the high side, and we position ourselves for that possibility. 
We believe our client franchise benefits from our consistent commitment to being a diversified and dependable provider of services. 
In this year’s letter to our shareholders, I will discuss these and other topics, including our financial profile and the state of our businesses. 
Financial Profile 
Given the challenging operating environment in the first half of 2016, we undertook steps and actions consistent with the difficult conditions. 
For the first quarter of 2016, with net revenues down by 40 percent year over year, we accrued compensation and benefits expenses 40 percent lower year over year. We ended the year with net revenues and compensation and benefits expenses nine and eight percent lower than 2015, respectively. 
We also completed an initiative that identified a reduction of approximately $900 million in annual
run rate compensation during the year, in which we realized approximately $500 million, net of severance and other related costs, during 2016. Including these efforts, we have announced and completed $2.8 billion in savings initiatives since 2011. This demonstrates how our flexible cost base helps us navigate challenging operating environments. 
The impact of our efforts can be seen by comparing our results in 2016 to 2011. 2011 was an instructive year — as it was a tough net revenues year, similar to 2016. In 2011, we had net revenues of approximately $29 billion with operating expenses of approximately $23 billion. Our compensation and benefits to net revenues ratio was more than 42 percent and our pre-tax margin was over 21 percent. 
In 2016, despite higher net revenues, our operating expenses were down by 10 percent vs. 2011, our compensation and benefits to net revenues ratio was down by 400 basis points and our pre-tax margin was more than 12 percentage points higher. This reflects a lot of the firm’s work in cost discipline and provides significant operating leverage for the future. 
Our cost savings efforts in 2016 were part of a broader focus on efficiencies. For example, over the past five years we have grown our head count in our Salt Lake City office by nearly 80 percent, making it our fourth-largest location globally. 
In terms of our capital and liquidity, our balance sheet has never been more conservatively positioned as a result of adjustments we have made to adapt to new regulations since the financial crisis. By almost all measures, Goldman Sachs, and the broader financial system, is safer. For example, our Global Core Liquid Assets have increased by almost four times, our common shareholders’ equity has nearly doubled and our gross leverage has been cut by more than one-half since the end of 2007. 
Moreover, we have reduced our balance sheet size by seven percent over the past five years, while increasing our common shareholders’ equity by 13 percent and our book value per common share by 40 percent. Over the same period, we have returned nearly $32 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, reducing our basic share count by more than 100 million shares, or approximately 20 percent, to the lowest ever. 
Importantly, while these efforts helped us to strengthen our balance sheet, they did not detract us from remaining focused on sustaining and improving the quality of our client franchise. 
Investment Banking 
Our investment banking franchise reflects deep relationships with more than 8,000 clients across a variety of industries in approximately 100 countries. 
We ended the year ranked first in global announced and completed mergers and acquisitions, advising on many of the year’s most significant transactions. As has long been the case, our advisory franchise creates other opportunities across the firm, such as in debt underwriting, which is able to serve our clients with 
best-in-class debt financing capabilities. Our financial advisory net revenues declined compared to a strong 2015, partially offset by record debt underwriting net revenues of $2.5 billion. In fact, we ended the year ranked in the top five in global debt and in the top three in global high-yield — areas where we traditionally have not had the same footprint as some of our 
larger competitors. We also continued to maintain a leading equity underwriting franchise, though net revenues declined significantly in 2016 as a result of the operating environment. 
Nevertheless, we ended the year strong, as our investment banking transaction backlog grew in the fourth quarter. 
Institutional Client Services 
With a leading, diversified global platform in Institutional Client Services (ICS), comprising our Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution (FICC) and Equities franchises, we are one of the few firms that have remained committed to serving our clients’ needs broadly across financial products, services and regions. 
We did not extrapolate from the exceptional conditions of the past several years to draw hard and fast conclusions about the FICC franchise. These conditions included interest rates near or below zero, a flat yield curve and muted economic growth. That is why we put a premium on maintaining our commitment to businesses that we knew were important to our clients. 
We have a diverse client franchise, and one area of particular strength has long been our standing with the hedge fund community. Our product diversity, global footprint, world-class prime brokerage capabilities, and engagement strategy based on content are of particular value to hedge fund clients. 
Over the past few years, we also have made it a key priority to deepen relationships with more traditional asset managers. As an example of our progress, we have seen market share improvements in our U.S. cash credit businesses, where asset managers have historically 
been active. 
Both hedge funds and active managers could face a much different and more attractive market environment in 2017. To the extent decreasing market correlations translate into a better backdrop for generating outsized performance, that should also support increasing levels of client activity. 
Despite the headwinds that marked the start of 2016,
ICS net revenues were down modestly compared to 2015. FICC net revenues increased slightly year over year, which is notable given market conditions in the first quarter. Equities client execution net revenues declined significantly year over year, driven by lower client
activity levels. 
Investment Management 
Our broad portfolio of solutions and consistent performance have enabled us to be one of the fastest- growing active investment managers in the world. Our product offerings range from asset and liability management for our private wealth clients, to tailored advisory solutions for our institutional clients, to fund products across all asset classes. 
Net revenues declined year over year in 2016, due largely to lower incentive fees. However, even in a more challenging environment, we have continued to build our franchise. Over the past three years, we have grown our assets under supervision by $337 billion to a record of nearly $1.4 trillion. That growth would be akin to creating a top 30 U.S. asset manager in just three years, and includes $150 billion of organic active long-term net inflows. During this period, many active investment managers have seen net client outflows. 
Despite such growth, we continue to see significant potential as investors consolidate assets with leading providers. There are bigger players within each of the product categories in which we compete, offering room to garner more market share. We will pursue that growth by providing clients with comprehensive advice, thought leadership and innovative products that will help them 
to better meet their investing needs. 
Investing & Lending 
Investing & Lending is a collection of activities that
is synergistic with other elements of our overall franchise, helping us to expand our client relationships. We continue to provide long-term capital by way of direct lending and equity investments, and remain focused on opportunities that provide strong risk-adjusted returns on capital over the long term. 
Growing Our Lending Footprint 
In particular, we continue to see lending as a growth opportunity for the firm. Approximately one-third
of our 2016 net revenues in Investing & Lending was generated by debt securities and loans, which included more than $1 billion in net interest income. 
Over the past four years, we increased our funded
loans 2.8 times to roughly $64 billion. Corporate loans, diversified across sectors and industries, make up
46 percent of the portfolio, followed by private wealth management loans at 32 percent and real estate loans at 17 percent. We continue to see increased demand from our investment banking and private wealth management clients, and we are intent on prudently increasing our lending portfolio. 
This past fall, we launched Marcus: By Goldman
Sachs — an online lending platform designed to provide consumer clients with an alternative to higher-interest- rate credit card debt. The growth in digital finance, combined with our historical strength in technology and risk management, led us to see an opportunity to add value to this attractive new market for Goldman Sachs. 
By most measures, the opportunity is broad and deep. The unsecured consumer loan market in the U.S. is roughly $850 billion. We are focused on creditworthy consumers with $5,000 to $30,000 of credit card debt, the majority of whom are not aware of better debt management options. We have received encouraging feedback from our new clients as we have slowly built out the business, and continue to see potential for attractive risk-adjusted growth opportunities. 
Focus on Technology 
Technology is central to every part of our business. Simply put, it is a core competitive advantage that drives long-term value in several ways — namely, through enhancing our clients’ experience, driving efficiency
and creating new opportunities, like Marcus. 
Our investment in our Marquee platform, a collection of applications for our institutional clients, represents one such cutting-edge opportunity. Marquee allows clients to access some of the same analysis and risk management tools our market makers use. 
More broadly, we are investing in infrastructure
to improve our electronic execution capabilities, including for systematic investing clients who require speed and differentiated execution, and for straight- through processing. 
We have also made successful investments in electronic execution platforms. Our global infrastructure, as a result of this and other investments, is now capable of executing equity and select FICC transactions in a much more efficient manner. Importantly, all of our clients — not just our clients with quantitative strategies — enjoy the benefits of better execution. 
We have likewise integrated technology into our recruiting processes, in particular to facilitate first-round video interviews with the goal of widening and diversifying the pool of talent we evaluate. For 2017’s intern class, so far we have conducted interviews with candidates from more than 900 schools, reaching 100 more schools than last year. 
Our People 
Of course, our most important long-term competitive advantage is our people. Our commitment to attracting and retaining the most talented people in our industry — and beyond — is of vital importance to the firm and the perennial foundation of our success. 
We must be diverse and representative of the countries and cultures in which we operate. Our people represent more than 160 different nationalities and speak over 100 different languages. 
I am pleased to report that Goldman Sachs remains
a highly attractive place to work. In 2016, our summer internship and full-time campus applicants rose by
11 percent. We had approximately 130,000 applicants for just 5,000 internship and full-time campus roles — approximately a four percent hiring rate. In addition,
of those who received offers, approximately eight out of 10 accepted. And, in 2016, we were proud to be named as one of Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Goldman Sachs is one of only five companies to be recognized every year that the Great Place to
Work Institute has issued its list since 1984. 
Given the growing significance of technology in how we operate our businesses, we have increasingly been focused on hiring individuals with backgrounds in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
In 2016, 37 percent of new campus analysts who joined the firm came from these STEM majors. Today, approximately 9,000 people, or roughly one-quarter 
of the firm, work in various engineering-related roles. 
More broadly, our people continue to see the value of a long-term career at Goldman Sachs. The median tenure of our partners and managing directors at the firm is 15 years, and nearly 60 percent of them joined the firm as an analyst or associate (our entry level positions). 
To ensure that the talent we hire is the talent we keep over the long term, we invest hundreds of thousands of training hours in our new analysts, and provide thousands of classroom programs and digital resources for senior professionals. 
Executive Succession and Our Deep Leadership Bench 
In 2016 and the early part of this year, we saw a number of movements in our leadership ranks, as well as a key addition to our Board of Directors. As chairman and chief executive officer, in consultation with our Board 
of Directors, one of my most important priorities is smooth and effective leadership transitions. 
This past December, then–U.S. President-elect Donald Trump appointed Gary Cohn, then our president and chief operating officer, director of the National Economic Council. Gary was responsible for developing and leading many of the firm’s most important initiatives, and demonstrated a deep commitment to our clients, 
our people and the culture of Goldman Sachs. We thank him for having served as a trusted advisor, dedicated colleague and friend to so many at the firm, and
wish him well. 
David Solomon, our former co-head of the Investment Banking Division, and Harvey Schwartz, our chief financial officer, assumed new responsibilities as presidents and co-chief operating officers of the firm. In addition, Marty Chavez, chief information officer, was named deputy chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs and will become chief financial officer. 
This past year was also marked by some senior retirements from the firm. Michael “Woody” Sherwood, vice chairman of the firm and co-chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs International, and Mark Schwartz, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific and vice chairman of the firm, announced their retirements following decades of service. We wish both Woody and Mark all the best in the years ahead and thank them for their extraordinary contributions to Goldman Sachs. 
Richard Gnodde, co-head of the Investment Banking Division and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs International, and Pablo Salame, co-head of the Securities Division, were appointed vice chairmen of the firm. David, Harvey, Marty, Richard and Pablo have a long track record of distinction in their respective areas of expertise, spanning multiple businesses and geographies. 
In December, we welcomed a new member to our Board of Directors. Ellen Kullman is an accomplished business leader who has held a variety of senior roles at E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, including as chairman and chief executive officer. We are confident that her deep experience in business and as a board member in both the public and nonprofit sectors will add great value to our Board of Directors. 
Our Tradition of Leadership and Public Service 
Gary was not the first person from Goldman Sachs to join the government, and we hope and expect that he will not be the last. Five of my most recent predecessors went into government service, and that has not been 
by happenstance. One ethic that has long pervaded Goldman Sachs is a commitment to public service if one is given the opportunity to serve. And that has been true over time and in many of the geographies in which we operate. 
We recruit people who are oriented to the larger world, and their jobs require them to be both outwardly and inwardly facing. In the process, they develop the skills to make a contribution in large, complex organizations and the expertise to help drive economic progress and job creation. 
We have been criticized for the fact that some of our colleagues, after long careers at the firm, have moved
to work in the public sector. The charge is that Goldman Sachs is able to extract certain advantages that others cannot. In fact, the opposite is true. Those in government bend over backward to avoid any perception of favoritism. 
We are proud of our tradition of leadership and public service and believe it is a core part of our culture. That is why we will continue to encourage our people to contribute to government service if they are fortunate enough to be asked. 
We also have contributed our expertise and knowledge
to broader public policy issues, such as fiscal policy.
And, when certain issues impact our people, we have not hesitated to speak up on their behalf. In the past, we have commented on marriage equality, and more recently, immigration policy, because they both affect our ability to hire and retain people from the broadest pool of talent. We will continue to express our views on policies that affect our people, our business and the long-term interests of economic growth. 
Our Commitment to Our Communities 
Goldman Sachs has long embraced our responsibility
to help address social and economic challenges around the world. Our approach goes far beyond the significant financial support we provide to a broad array of philanthropic endeavors; we also make meaningful contributions that harness our business expertise, relationships and knowledge to address critical needs
in the communities in which we work and live —
and sometimes far beyond. 
10,000 Women 
Since 2008, the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women initiative has helped foster economic growth by providing women entrepreneurs in 56 countries with business education and access to capital. The initiative is now expanding to reach more than 10,000 women through a first-of-its- kind global finance facility launched in partnership with the International Finance Corporation to increase access to capital for women entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. By the end of 2016, the facility had committed more than $600 million to banks in 17 emerging markets, which will enable more than 30,000 women entrepreneurs to access capital. 
10,000 Small Businesses 
10,000 Small Businesses has served more than 7,300 small businesses at 31 sites across the United States and the United Kingdom by the end of 2016. This initiative has worked with more than 100 local and national lenders and other organizations to provide access to management training, capital and business support services. Independent evaluations of the program have shown that participants consistently increase revenues and create net new jobs at a pace that outperforms
the broader economy. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
Through this donor-advised fund, partners at the firm recommend grants to nonprofit organizations around the 
world. Since its launch in 2010, the fund has made more than 28,000 grants totaling nearly $1.2 billion through the end of 2016 to 5,600 organizations that further Goldman Sachs Gives’ mission of fostering innovative ideas, and solving economic and social issues. Grants from Goldman Sachs Gives have recently supported 
the Middle East refugee crisis, STEM education for underserved youths globally, medical research across a variety of fields, and need-based financial aid at colleges and universities globally, to name a few key initiatives. 
Looking Ahead 
We often say that no one has a crystal ball. Markets change course at a moment’s notice, and in response
to factors no one can predict with any certainty. Cycles come and cycles go. But, if we manage our business with discipline and preserve our flexibility for upside, we can put ourselves in the best position to meet the needs of our clients and to grow our franchise. 
We have long maintained that it is important to remain active and invested in our core businesses, despite cyclical pressures, both as we respond in the short term and orient ourselves for the horizon. In the past decade or so, some in our industry pulled back from sales and trading businesses that, to some, seemed to be permanently and negatively affected by market conditions, regulatory change and other factors. 
We remained committed to the value we provide clients in those businesses across cycles. It is difficult to know how effective we have been at achieving the balance between cutting costs and investing in businesses until the cycle fully turns. Regardless of which way the future breaks, we do, however, see many reasons for optimism. 
Putting aside one’s individual politics, the outcome of the U.S. election raises the possibility of more stimulative tax and regulatory policies, as well as plans for more infrastructure spending. This represents a substantial change in direction for the U.S., and offers many investors and companies a reason for optimism. 
Economic growth was showing signs of improvement, even before the election. U.S. interest rates are poised to rise, as policymakers digest improving economic indicators, while other global markets hold steady 
or even engage in stimulus, creating opportunities for investors in monetary policy divergence. 
More durable market trends may yet emerge and spur healthier levels of client activity. Looking ahead to 2017, Goldman Sachs remains committed to working with our clients and leveraging the resources of the firm to help them achieve their objectives, while creating long-term value for shareholders. 
I believe that our client franchise is as strong as it
has ever been. We have transformed our balance sheet in ways that help us better weather challenging environments, while allowing us to pivot in times
of higher client activity. We have prudently managed our operating expenses and capital, building significant operating leverage. 
By staying true to our strategic focus, I am confident we can continue to generate industry-leading returns for shareholders and outperform over the long term. 
"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2017,"Throughout most of 2017, the global economy generally expanded, reflecting growth in both developed and emerging market economies. In the United States, the economic recovery continued into its ninth year as the labor market steadily improved. Euro area economies strengthened even as measures of inflation remained subdued. In Asia, Japan experienced solid growth, boosted by the strength of its exports, while China grew robustly, in part due to the global recovery and the success of past policy changes. 
 
For Goldman Sachs, generally higher asset prices and tighter credit spreads were supportive of mergers and underwriting as well as investing and lending activities. At the same time, low levels of volatility served as a headwind for our market-making businesses. 
The diversity of our net revenue mix was instrumental in our performance for the year, with three of our four segments producing solid revenue growth leading to
an overall increase in our net revenues. In 2017, we generated net revenues of $32.1 billion, a five percent increase over 2016. During 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Legislation) was enacted, resulting
in a $4.4 billion one-time estimated income tax expense. Excluding this expense, net earnings applicable to common shareholders grew 14 percent to $8.1 billion, diluted earnings per common share of $19.76 were 
21 percent higher and our return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 10.8 percent.1 
We have delivered double-digit ROE in five out of the last six years, and for that sixth year, our ROE was
9.4 percent.2 While we may not have a contract to deliver double-digit returns in every possible circumstance,
our focus and intensity, including the way we manage expenses, demonstrate the importance we attach to shareholder returns. 
Inflection Points 
This past year represented several points of inflection for our business and the industry. First, we appear to be moving from an environment of generally lower economic growth to one with stronger global growth and tighter labor markets. Second, central banks are shifting away from extraordinarily accommodative monetary policies — policies which have dampened market volatility — to, generally, more “normal” approaches. And third, we may be transitioning from an intense period of increasing layers of regulation to a focus on rationalizing redundancies and assessing costs and benefits. 
Against this backdrop, we are focusing our energy on earnings growth — in particular, growth from consistent investments in our franchise; growth by broadening our client and product footprint; and growth through new initiatives where we have not previously competed. Through it all, we assess opportunities through a framework that responds to a clear client need, leverages the firm’s core competencies including risk management and advice, and provides attractive, long-term shareholder returns. 
To that end, in September 2017, we laid out a $5 billion net revenue growth plan over the next three years. While the plan includes contributions from each of
our businesses, this is not the limit of our ambitions. Importantly, these strategic initiatives are not dependent on any improvement in the current operating environment. That said, broader economic trends, market conditions and client conviction appear to be more favorable. 
In this year’s letter to our shareholders, we provide
an overview of the progress we are making on our strategic growth initiatives across our major businesses. Underpinning these initiatives are significant investments in engineering, which are critical to driving the expansion of our client franchise. Our history of commitment to investing in technology has created a competitive advantage and is at the center of our efforts to enhance the client experience and improve operating efficiency and scale. We conclude the letter with some thoughts on the
year ahead. 
Our Focus on Growth 
Investment Banking 
We continue to have the preeminent global franchise in investment banking. In 2017, the business generated its second-highest net revenues since the firm’s initial public offering in 1999, driven by the deep relationships that we have built with more than 8,000 clients over many decades. We ended the year ranked first in worldwide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and also ranked first in worldwide equity and equity-related offerings and common stock offerings. 
To grow from here, we are increasing our coverage universe by approximately 1,000 companies, focusing
on both private and public companies where we have significant room to build relationships. Of the new target clients, we have begun covering over 30 percent and expect to add the remainder in the next 12 to 18 months. 
To put this opportunity into perspective, our announced M&A volume market share on transaction sizes greater than $5 billion was approximately 50 percent in
2017. However, we had just over 10 percent share 
on transaction sizes of less than $5 billion. These transactions tend to have fewer advisors and provide substantial financing opportunities. 
We are also expanding our presence in North America, deploying more senior coverage bankers in major cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle and Toronto. We see this as an important opportunity to deepen our client coverage in certain cities that are increasingly important hubs of corporate activity. As a result of all of our client coverage efforts, we have seen more than 75 new mandates across a variety of industry groups. 
Another reason for our confidence in Investment Banking’s growth is the success we have had in debt underwriting. We identified debt underwriting as a strategic priority five years ago, and in 2017, we produced nearly $3 billion of net revenues — more than double our average from 2009 to 2011. 
Lastly, China continues to represent a larger portion
of the global economy. Today, more than 20 percent of the Fortune Global 500 companies are Chinese. In 2017, we were ranked first in equity and equity-related offerings among international banks in the region,
and we are confident our strong footprint positions us well to continue to capture opportunities created by China’s growth. 
Institutional Client Services 
Institutional Client Services includes some of our
most dynamic businesses, and we manage the resources in these businesses in the context of the operating environment. This has been particularly true in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution (FICC). 
FICC. In the midst of industry-wide revenues falling by roughly 50 percent from their peak in 2009, we managed FICC resources down significantly. We took these actions because the opportunities in FICC had declined. This was certainly due to secular changes, but it also reflected cyclical dynamics as well. 
Today the trajectory of the global economy appears to be moving towards a firmer footing. In this context, we don’t believe it is wise strategically to forgo the potential upside in this business moving forward. In fact, we have recently deployed more resources given the increasingly attractive opportunity set. 
With respect to our execution and performance in 2017, our performance in FICC was weak in the context of our commitment to the business. In response, we undertook a comprehensive and detailed review to identify how we could improve. 
Our franchise has historically been very focused on active investor clients, structured trades and derivatives. As a consequence, we underinvested in cash products, which led to lower penetration with certain large asset managers and banks. 
To address these issues, we are broadening our bank
and asset manager client coverage and are focused on growing our corporate coverage. We have also diversified 
our product footprint by enhancing our cash and flow trading capabilities. And we are holding our people accountable for delivering top three client rankings. 
Our efforts are showing early signs of success, as we drive market share increases across our businesses. We are confident that these efforts will manifest themselves to all of our FICC clients over time. 
A key differentiator supporting our overall growth
will be employing our engineering capabilities to provide clients with best execution, content and analytics. For example, we have consolidated our automated pricing and risk management of electronic trading across Equities, Rates, Currencies and Commodities into a cohesive unit to drive efficiencies for our clients and
the firm. 
In summary, we are executing on our strategy in FICC to invest in areas where we see the greatest opportunity to meet client needs, grow market share and, if need be, reduce capital and expenses to size the business commensurate with client activity. 
Equities. In Equities, we are making a multiyear investment in people, platforms and products to grow our leading franchise in both execution and financing. 
In the last few years, we have made several strategic hires to enhance our electronic execution offering, including
a new chief data officer for the firm, a global head of electronic execution services and a chief technology officer of electronic trading. In 2017, we added about 100 people focused on electronic execution, including more than 70 engineers. 
In terms of platforms, two years ago we acquired a high-performance trading platform from Pantor Engineering AB, which we have now rolled out to our European clients. Today, our smart router capabilities put us among the top three providers of the fastest, most comprehensive access to developed European markets. 
At the end of 2017, we had an important validation of our electronic capabilities, announcing that we would become the exclusive execution provider for Bloomberg’s Tradebook. As a result, we are bringing on more than 1,300 new clients from which we expect a revenue run rate of over $100 million. 
These and other investments support our initiative to serve quantitative-focused investors. This is an important and growing segment of the market, where we provide both execution and financing services. From these and other investments, we expect to increase our market share in electronic execution, which will benefit all
of our Equities clients. 
Investment Management 
Our Investment Management business remains well positioned because of our breadth of asset classes, products and distribution. In 2017, we had $42 billion in long-term fee-based (LTFB) net inflows across the platform. We have had consistent growth with about $270 billion of LTFB net inflows over the last five years, including $52 billion from acquisitions. 
In Goldman Sachs Asset Management, we continue to
be a top provider to companies as they increasingly outsource the management of their pension plans and other assets. Currently, we have over $110 billion in assets where we act as a chief investment officer or advisor. In 2017, we made a strategic acquisition, further adding $20 billion of LTFB assets and contributing to our scale in this business. 
The same outsourcing trend is happening within
many insurance companies. We manage or advise on another $190 billion from insurance clients who leverage our enhanced analytics, custom asset allocation and risk management capabilities. 
In Private Wealth Management, we saw strong long-term net inflows of $17 billion in 2017, up from $12 billion in 2016. Wealth creation is expanding at a rapid clip and given the strength of our offering and brand, we have not seen the limit to the growth of this segment of the market. We currently have over 700 private wealth advisors and expect to grow our advisor population by approximately 30 percent through 2020. 
In Ayco, we provide financial planning services to 400 corporate clients and 13,000 executives across corporate America. However, we currently cover only 
20 percent of the Fortune 1000. At the end of 2017,
we launched our digital advisory service designed for Ayco corporate client employees. This platform is live
at more than 70 companies and we expect to roll this out to an additional 30 companies by the end of 2018. 
Investing & Lending 
Our Investing & Lending businesses provide promising companies and other clients with the capital they need
to grow — either in the form of a loan or an equity investment. Our funded loan portfolio was $81 billion at the end of 2017, 3.5 times higher since the end of 2012. 
In Private Wealth Management, we have increased our lending to our existing Private Wealth Management clients, growing our funded loans balance to about $24 billion in 2017 or a 15 percent increase year-over- year. Lending net revenues from Private Wealth Management clients increased about 30 percent compared to 2016. 
Through GS Select, we are working with third-party registered investment advisors to offer securities-based loans from Goldman Sachs Bank USA to their Private Wealth Management clients. This digital platform is just getting started, but we have already signed up some of the largest independent registered investment advisors in the U.S. who serve clients with nearly $4 trillion in assets. 
Institutional Lending and Financing is also an
important part of our growth strategy, an opportunity
set driven by our special situations group, a differentiated financing and investing business. Here, dedicated teams of experienced underwriters partner primarily with middle-market companies to finance assets, improve
their capital structure or deploy capital. This business is one of the highest margin and highest return businesses in the firm. 
By growing our loan portfolio, we have increased our net revenue contribution from net interest income, which makes Investing & Lending net revenues more stable and recurring. We entered 2018 with a $2 billion net interest income run rate, before considering further loan growth. And net interest income in the fourth quarter was up roughly 70 percent year-over-year. 
Another important investing business is our merchant banking business, which helps to start and grow companies. Merchant banking has been a source of strong risk-adjusted return opportunities and a core part of the firm’s DNA and mission. We’ve been in this business for over 30 years and it constitutes as powerful a franchise as any other in our firm. 
Since the beginning of 2015, we generated nearly
$11 billion of net revenues from our diversified portfolio of equity investments, with the largest contribution from merchant banking. 
We continue to see attractive opportunities as an active investor, on behalf of both our clients and the firm, where our unique global franchise is an excellent sourcing mechanism. For example, in the past two years, we sourced over $40 billion in commitments to invest across our equity and credit merchant banking activities. 
In November 2017, we announced the Cooperation Fund, partnering with the China Investment Corporation. We intend to raise $5 billion to invest mainly in American manufacturing, industrial, consumer and healthcare companies, among others, that are developing business
in China, or anticipate doing so in the future. 
Marcus 
Marcus: by Goldman Sachs (Marcus) is our digital consumer financial services platform. The foundation of this new business is rooted in addressing real consumer pain points by delivering value through products that are simple, transparent and flexible. Marcus launched with single no-fee personal loans and is evolving into a suite of products and services that we believe will move the needle for the firm over the coming years. 
We are building Marcus at a point in time when consumers are moving away from brick-and-mortar branches to solutions that use technology to more seamlessly meet their needs. Goldman Sachs is uniquely positioned to be a disruptor in consumer finance — 
we can leverage our stable balance sheet, expertise in risk management and capabilities in technology without the burden of legacy distribution, technology and businesses that could constrain our ability to offer consumers better terms. 
We originated $2.3 billion of personal loans from
launch through the end of 2017. As we grow our portfolio, we remain very cognizant of the credit cycle. Our credit policy and pricing are designed to build a resilient loan book, and we remain deliberate in the pacing of our growth. We also continue to grow and diversify our sources of funding through our deposits business; Marcus deposits grew by more than $5 billion in 2017, ending the year at $17.1 billion — nearly double the balances we started with when we entered the business in April 2016. As of the end of 2017, Marcus was serving more than 350,000 customers across loans and deposits, with the clear potential to build relationships with millions of consumers. 
While we recognize that it is early for us in the digital consumer finance space, there is a real need in the market, and the opportunities for further investment are compelling. We intend to extend our lending and savings products over time, both direct-to-consumer and through partnerships. 
In addition, longer-term, we see opportunities to
expand our suite of consumer offerings, and our criteria for evaluating new products will remain consistent: a large addressable market, the ability to leverage our expertise, the ability to deliver attractive shareholder returns, and importantly, the ability to deliver consumer- centric solutions. 
Our People 
Our most important long-term competitive advantage remains our people. With that in mind, we invest heavily to attract, develop and promote extraordinary professionals who can serve our clients and drive 
our growth. 
To that end, we are proud that we were once again recognized as one of Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Goldman Sachs is one of only four companies to be recognized every year that the Great Place to Work Institute has issued its list since 1984. We were also named as one of Working Mother’s “100 Best Companies,” which ranks companies with the best programs that support working parents, for the fifteenth consecutive year, earning us a place on the magazine’s “Hall of Fame” list. 
In 2017, we hired more than 6,000 people around
the world — recruiting each person one by one. Our application rates continue to rise and more than eight
out of 10 people who were offered a role chose to join the firm. Our recruiting strategy is centered on expanding and diversifying our applicant pool. Through the use of technology, including video interviewing and hosting online coding challenges, we increased the number of schools from which we interview intern candidates
by more than 150 schools for the 2018 class, compared to 2017. 
What’s more, given the growing importance of technology to our businesses, we continue to focus
on hiring individuals with backgrounds in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Today, approximately one-quarter of the firm works in various engineering-related roles. More than one-third of our 2017 campus analyst hires majored in a STEM discipline, and that percentage will only continue to rise as we welcome our incoming 2018 class later this year. 
In 2017, we selected our newest class of managing directors (MDs). Twenty-four percent of the 509 new MDs are women, while regionally, around 25 percent hail from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 57 percent from the Americas and 18 percent from Asia. In addition, 66 percent of the new class started at the firm as analysts or associates, a reflection of our commitment to talent development and retention over the long-term. 
Succession and Our Leadership Bench 
One of my most important responsibilities as chairman and chief executive officer is to work with our Board
of Directors on ensuring smooth and effective leadership transitions. Our firm is fortunate to have a deep pool 
of talent at all levels, and regardless of when the
next transition is to take effect, we are well prepared. With Harvey Schwartz’s announced retirement as president and co-chief operating officer (COO) of the firm, David Solomon will assume sole responsibility for these roles. I look forward to working with David to continue to build our global franchise and pursue long-term value for our shareholders. 
Over his 20-year career, Harvey has held leadership roles across a broad range of the firm’s operations — from Securities and Investment Banking, to serving as chief financial officer (CFO) and, most recently, as president and co-COO. As the global co-head of 
the Securities Division, Harvey was instrumental in overseeing growth in our client franchise across FICC and Equities. During the financial crisis, Harvey played an important role in the management of our risk exposures, even while we were meeting the significant needs of our clients. During Harvey’s tenure as CFO, he played a critical role in helping the firm adapt 
to significant changes in the regulatory environment. Harvey has consistently demonstrated his deep commitment to the firm and its values. His work ethic, command of complexity and client focus have defined his career, while his influence on many leaders at the firm has made an indelible impact on generations 
of professionals at Goldman Sachs. We thank Harvey for his exceptional service and wish him all the best in the years ahead. 
Our Impact 
Goldman Sachs has long embraced our responsibility to help address crucial environmental, social and economic challenges around the world, both through our core businesses and by engaging in activities that leverage our expertise to promote economic progress. As part of that mission, we seek to be active and long-term corporate citizens in the communities in which we operate. Given our position at the crossroads of the capital markets, our mission is to drive positive change in our work with clients by helping them to grow their businesses, be on 
a stronger financial footing, provide access to key services and contribute to economic growth. 
In some cases, that means helping entrepreneurs succeed through programs such as 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses. In other cases, we are financing projects that can improve living standards within traditionally underserved communities. Our goal is to conduct philanthropy with a purpose — making meaningful contributions where our skills and leadership can make 
a clear difference. 
10,000 Small Businesses Summit 
As a natural next step in our focus on small businesses, we hosted in February 2018 the 10,000 Small Businesses Summit: The Big Power of Small Business, which was the largest-ever gathering of small business owners in the U.S. Taking place in Washington, D.C., the summit convened more than 2,000 small business owners from 
a diverse range of industries and geographies with a select group of business leaders, industry experts and policymakers to discuss the vital role that small businesses play in the U.S. economy. 
From sharing strategies and tactics for hiring, obtaining capital and optimizing growth, to discussing policy- related topics such as regulation and global competition, this unique event provided an opportunity for the alumni of 10,000 Small Businesses to come together and share ideas, discuss common challenges and elevate their collective voice. The following day, participants took that voice to Capitol Hill, where they met with representatives from their respective districts and states to advocate for policies that support the continued ability of small businesses to grow, thrive and compete. 
Goldman Sachs Gives 
Goldman Sachs Gives is a donor-advised fund through which participating managing directors of the firm can recommend grants to qualified nonprofit organizations around the world. Since its launch in 2010, the fund has made more than $1.3 billion in grants through the end of 2017 to 6,000 organizations that further Goldman Sachs Gives’ mission of fostering innovative ideas, solving economic and social issues, and enabling progress in underserved communities worldwide. 
As an example of our firm’s commitment to citizenship and community engagement, Goldman Sachs Gives continued to expand its reach in 2017, through initiatives such as the second annual Analyst Impact Fund, a competition whereby teams of analysts from the firm vied to win a Goldman Sachs Gives grant to the nonprofit 
of their choice. Demonstrating the teamwork, analytics and excellence that are core to the values and culture
of Goldman Sachs, the analysts who participated represented a broad range of Goldman Sachs offices and divisions. The three winning teams supported nonprofit 
organizations that focus on delivering online educational resources for female refugees, bail reform initiatives and the education of girls in rural India. 
Additionally, in the wake of the destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as the earthquakes in Mexico, the firm and Goldman Sachs Gives made grants exceeding $2 million to organizations providing immediate resources, short-term relief, long- term housing and small business reconstruction and recovery. Equally important, more than 1,000 volunteers across the firm donated their time to help in the immediate and ongoing recovery efforts. 
Urban Investment Group 
Through our Urban Investment Group (UIG), we have realized the potential for investments in underserved urban areas. We work with local leaders and nonprofits, focusing on community development and financing for socially motivated enterprises and small businesses. While the investment strategy has evolved over the years, the mission remains the same: to make an impact in underserved areas while making a good return. 
Since its inception in 2001 through the end of
2017, UIG has committed more than $6 billion to underserved U.S. communities, facilitating the creation and preservation of more than 25,000 housing units — the majority of which are affordable for low- to middle-income families — as well as more than 2 million square feet of community space and over 7.5 million square feet of commercial, retail and industrial facilities. 
As an example, Goldman Sachs committed nearly
$500 million to the Essex Crossing development on
the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The project, at
1.9 million square feet, is one of the largest developments in New York City and is reactivating a site that had sat vacant for almost 50 years. Essex Crossing, which was designed with the local community, will include just over 1,000 apartments, more than half of which are reserved for low- and middle-income tenants, and 900,000 square feet of commercial and community space. Such projects have the potential to usher in a new model for urban investment, focusing on infrastructure, jobs and resources that benefit the public at large. 
Looking Ahead 
Today, conditions are highly supportive of a growing economy and interest rates are relatively low for where we are in the growth cycle. But as managers of risk,
we do our best to prepare our clients and the firm for low-probability, yet highly consequential events. With the U.S. near full employment, inflation still relatively low and the end of quantitative easing, there is a greater chance that excesses can build up. In this vein, we continue to be mindful of what can go wrong, keeping a close eye on risk, particularly in the context of the credit cycle. 
Cycles come and go, and, as we have seen in recent months, markets can change course at a moment’s notice, and often in response to factors no one can predict with any certainty. 
Still, we remain optimistic and confident in our ability to grow. Our client franchise is strong and we are executing on our growth initiatives, including making investments across our businesses to expand our franchise and to grow earnings across the firm. 
The hard work, commitment and collaboration of our people will remain cornerstones of our long-term success. In the process, we are confident that we can continue to generate strong relative returns and value for our shareholders. 
"
Goldman Sachs,GS,Financials,2018,"The opportunity to lead Goldman Sachs is extraordinarily humbling and exciting, made even more so as this year is the firm’s 150th anniversary. Like each of my predecessors, my responsibility is to preserve the legacy of Goldman Sachs, while remaining open to the change and innovation that best meets the needs of our clients. 
I am privileged to be surrounded by exceptionally talented people at all levels of our firm, including John Waldron, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Stephen Scherr, our Chief Financial Officer, who are also intensely focused on ensuring that clients are at the center of everything we do — and in doing so, creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
While much has changed over the course of our 150-year history, teamwork, integrity, adaptability and client service remain at the core of our culture. 
The strength of our culture and client franchise was at the heart of our financial performance in 2018. We achieved record diluted earnings per common share, and attained our highest annual return on average common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity since 2009. Net revenues of $36.62 billion and pre-tax earnings of $12.48 billion were both 12 percent higher compared with 2017 and the highest since 2010. Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share increased by 15 percent during the year to $207.36 and $196.64, respectively. 
Our Strategy 
This performance, alongside our strong levels of capital and liquidity, put Goldman Sachs on a solid foundation. As we look ahead, our focus is on delivering sustainable, long-term returns for our shareholders through a strategy that revolves around our clients. 
Our strategy comprises three core priorities: 
• Growing and strengthening our existing businesses by deepening our relationships with existing clients, and expanding our capabilities to serve new clients; 
• Diversifying our business mix by increasing our fee-based or more recurring revenues, including by launching new products and services; and, 
• Achieving greater operating efficiency across all areas of the firm, including expenses, funding costs and capital, without compromising the long-standing strength of our control and risk management functions. 
Our strategy reflects the need to anticipate and adapt to the structural forces that shape economies and industries and how our clients operate within them. Markets, financial instruments and products and different client segments are converging and competing with one another at an unprecedented pace. 
This requires us to simultaneously invest for growth and to create better efficiencies in the way we run certain businesses. I have advised companies for over three 
decades and the ones I have admired most are those that have managed their resources to allow for both investment and shareholder return. This is particularly critical when you consider how technology is influencing the way institutions and consumers alike are transacting in various markets and products, including in our industry. 
In that context, across a number of our businesses, particularly our market-making businesses, we have to achieve the scale necessary to execute transactions in the most effective way for our clients. That means investing in platforms and empowering those who build them. It means encouraging the innovative ideas of our people that take good products and make them great. And it means looking at the revenues and expenses of businesses “front-to-back” so that we have a clear-eyed view of where technology investments, the allocation of capital and other resources will be most critical to best delivering our advice, execution and risk management to our clients. 
Since last fall, we have undertaken a review of each
of our major businesses and the core activities within them. Each review has reinforced the fact that we benefit enormously from a strong client franchise around the world. At the same time, we see tremendous opportunities to expand our addressable market and grow new businesses. As we pursue these opportunities, our focus on strong risk management and controls will be central to our ability to meet the expectations of
our clients and our shareholders. 
Over the course of the year, I look forward to communicating more details on our strategic direction and priorities, which will include sharing certain financial metrics and targets to which my colleagues and I will be held accountable. I feel a sense of urgency and excitement about the opportunities we have identified, but, it is
also important to be diligent and deliberate and not
rush into long-term decision making. 
While not exhaustive, I want to spend the bulk of this letter providing you with a sense of the opportunities and priorities we will be focused on in the months and years ahead.

Grow and Strengthen Our Existing Businesses 
Our first strategic priority is to expand our existing businesses and we are executing on a variety of growth initiatives to that end. 
In Investment Banking, for example, we have embarked on a broad footprint expansion strategy that includes hiring new senior bankers, adding coverage for more than 1,000 new companies, and creating opportunities to help more clients access equity capital and debt financing. As of year end, we have made significant progress, having assigned coverage on approximately 95 percent of our targeted universe of new clients across the Americas and EMEA. 
Across FICC and Equities, we have strong institutional wallet share, which has improved by 65 and 110 basis points, respectively, since 2016.1 When I talk with many of our clients, it is clear that they value FICC’s deep risk intermediation capabilities and expertise. In addition 
to that focus, we continue to leverage platforms that integrate execution, analytics and content for our clients. In Equities, we are growing our electronic execution business through the development of low-touch platforms. And, we are working with more corporate clients in EMEA and Asia, particularly as it relates to our ability to deliver risk management solutions to them. 
Over the past five years, Investment Management has generated organic, long-term fee-based net inflows of approximately $215 billion. We see further potential in this business by growing our advisory and outsourced CIO services, as well as by expanding our product offering — notably, our Alternatives platform and ETFs. We are also expanding our world-class private wealth management business by adding new private wealth advisors and increasing our collateralized lending to clients. 
Within Investing & Lending, our Merchant Banking business comprises a diversified portfolio across Corporate Private Equity and global Real Estate that
is managed by hundreds of investment professionals
and led by tenured senior leadership. Our strong track record, built over the course of several decades, positions us well to provide clients with additional attractive investing opportunities. 
These various initiatives to strengthen and grow our existing businesses will be underscored by an emphasis on delivering the full value of One Goldman Sachs to our clients. An increasing number of institutions and companies interact with different parts of our firm. They don’t view their relationship with Goldman Sachs through the prism of a product or division. Historically, we have tended to manage our client relationships through more of a divisional lens, which can sometimes limit a more holistic view of how best to identify and meet the needs of these clients who are global, 
complex and multifaceted. 
One of my first priorities as CEO has been to ensure that the full range of our services and skill set is more accessible, comprehensive and efficiently delivered.
In that vein, we have formed a cross-divisional client initiative, led by senior leaders in our Institutional Client Services, Investment Management and Investment Banking businesses to work with a pilot group of 
clients with multidimensional business needs. 
Even at this early stage, I am encouraged by the feedback from our clients and what we have learned from them. Over time, we plan to expand this initiative to a broader group of clients with the simple goal of ensuring that 
we are orienting our client coverage around what is most important to our clients regardless of division or product area focus. 
Diversify Our Business Mix
with New Products and Services
A second element of our strategy is a focus on more durable revenues through lending and deposit activities, cash management and wealth management. We have made considerable progress over the past five years,
but there is more we can do in the years ahead. 
In 2016, we established Marcus: by Goldman Sachs, our digital consumer financial services business. We are working to connect our growing customer base — and their growing wealth — to our broader suite of services as we develop a multitiered digital wealth 
management offering. Over time, we expect this will grow to be another core capability of our client-centric multiproduct Marcus platform. 
We are pleased with our early progress: we have
more than 3 million total customers, $36 billion in consumer deposits in the U.S. and the U.K., and nearly $5 billion of consumer loans. We are cognizant of the risk profile of our nascent consumer lending business and will remain attentive to where we are in the cycle as we grow our business for the long term. 
We are also developing a dynamic, digital cash management and payments platform for corporate clients. And, the potential for Goldman Sachs in this space is significant. The industry cash management wallet is larger than the global investment banking wallet we compete
for today. 
As the leading M&A advisor globally, companies already trust us to provide advice on their most significant transactions. We will build on these strong relationships and forge new ones by delivering new solutions that solve customer frustrations around outdated technology and limited customization and analytics. 
We see a real opportunity to provide clients with a modern, global cash management platform that is both secure and flexible. We expect this business to be accretive to our return profile and to provide a number of benefits 
to adjacent businesses, including growing deposits and generating more client flows for our currencies franchise. 
We are making tangible progress in building this platform and I expect that we will launch a cash management offering to clients next year. 
Achieve Greater Operating Efficiency 
Our third strategic priority is to ensure we are maximizing operating efficiency by investing in automation and technology that will improve the client experience and drive expense savings across our businesses. 
For instance, in FICC, we are a top-2 institutional provider and gained share in six of eight asset classes 
in 2018,2 but the opportunity set and the global FICC wallet has declined significantly over the past decade. To adapt, we have made important improvements in FICC’s efficiency, reducing standardized risk-weighted assets by 40 percent and expenses by more than 20 percent, each compared to 2013. FICC will continue to be a valuable offering for our clients and we see attractive opportunities to build scale within FICC as the market structure continues to evolve. Part of building scale is through improving the client experience and that means operating more efficiently. 
Positioning ourselves for growth across our businesses partially entails funding investments from realized operating leverage in our core businesses. To help enforce this, we are looking at our costs holistically and have improved our firmwide efficiency ratio to 64 percent in 2018, down nearly 2 percentage points over the past two years. 
We also are identifying ways to manage our balance sheet more efficiently. We have identified deposits as a strategic focus to diversify our funding mix and lower our funding costs and have grown our deposit base by $34 billion over the past two years to $158 billion at the end of 2018. 
A Culture of Risk Management 
As we grow and expand our business reach, bringing Goldman Sachs to more clients and customers, we
are dedicated to maintaining the primacy of the control function at the firm and upholding the highest standards in risk and operational management. 
There are always important lessons to be learned from difficult situations and as it relates to 1MDB, we have looked back and will continue to reflect on anything
else the firm could have done better. It remains a priority for me that our culture of integrity, compliance and escalation only improves from this experience. 
Effective risk management is demanding and difficult. It requires constant vigilance and we won’t always get 
6 Goldman Sachs 2018 Annual Report 
it right. But an unwavering cultural commitment to it lies at the heart of an effective financial institution and we believe it is a core competence that helps define Goldman Sachs. 
Our People 
I have been fortunate to have worked closely with
Lloyd Blankfein over the years, who stepped down as Chairman and CEO last year. Throughout his 36 years
of dedicated service to the firm, his keen understanding of markets and risk have been invaluable to keeping the firm both nimble and resolute in the face of constant change. And amidst the most turbulent days of the global financial crisis, it was Lloyd’s fortitude and leadership that steadily navigated Goldman Sachs and its people through one of the most difficult episodes in our history. He has been a valued partner and colleague, and I am grateful for his mentorship, judgment and counsel. 
In my travels and time with clients, one refrain I hear time and again is that Goldman Sachs is different because of the quality of our people. Our success in delivering for our clients and on our strategic priorities depends on attracting, retaining and developing talented people. Professionals want to be constantly learning, working on important problems that have broad significance to industries, economies and society, and to be surrounded by diverse colleagues. 
In my short time as CEO, I’ve been vocal about the importance of advancing our firm’s diversity, including with respect to gender, race, sexual orientation, disability or whatever contributes to who we are. Effectively serving a broad and diverse set of clients means having an appreciation and understanding of their different experiences, interests and values, and we are committed to building a team capable of that critical work. Over the years, the firm’s diversity and inclusion efforts have evolved from raising broader awareness and delivering an array of programs to a more deliberate, data-driven and targeted strategy. 
We have made progress in recent years and have more diverse representation on our Board of Directors. In addition, our most recent partner class had the highest percentage of women and black partners in our history and, we are nearly there on the campus analyst hiring goals we established last year. But, we have a longer path ahead of us as it relates to our broader diversity ambitions. We are working with our Global Diversity Committee to advance specific goals and objectives. We are undertaking new initiatives aimed at increasing the representation of diverse communities at all levels across the firm. This includes increasing the representation of our analyst and entry-level associate new joiners — which represents more than 70 percent of our annual hiring — to 50 percent women, 11 percent black professionals and 14 percent Hispanic/Latino professionals in the Americas, and 
9 percent black professionals in the U.K. 
Fundamental change takes time, but if we’re rigorous in our execution of incremental change, we will make it happen. We simply do not have a choice but to strive to be one of the most diverse and inclusive institutions in the world. If we are not creative and do not take the right measures to embed a more diverse workforce across every facet of diversity, we put in jeopardy our relevance to our clients and the markets we serve. 
Sustainability 
Managing the firm responsibly is core to our goal
of driving superior long-term shareholder returns.
We cannot be successful over the long term for our investors unless we think broadly about the impact we have on society and our communities — and then, orient ourselves toward ways we can allocate 
capital purposefully. 
A dedication to service and a commitment to using our expertise and convening power to help address broader issues has long been a core element of our culture. Over the course of many years, we have developed innovative and meaningful philanthropic programs that have improved business education and provided access to capital for thousands of women entrepreneurs and small businesses. 
Since the launch of our 10,000 Women initiative in 2008, we have invested over $150 million to help women entrepreneurs across 56 countries, providing practical business education, mentoring, networking
and access to capital. Most recently, we have democratized access to business education on a global scale through the introduction of online business education courses. In addition, this past year, the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility — developed in partnership with the IFC as the first of its kind gender facility — surpassed $1 billion in investments to financial institutions in 31 countries and is well on its way to providing capital to 100,000 women. 
Through our 10,000 Small Businesses program, launched in 2010, we have committed $500 million to provide training and access to capital to small business owners looking to grow and create new jobs in their communities, with compelling results. To date,
we have graduated 8,200 small business owners, with 78 percent of graduates reporting revenue increases and 57 percent adding jobs within 30 months of graduation. 
We will continue our commitment to these extraordinary programs, but we see an increasing opportunity to focus on some of the other important issues that are facing society today — from the environment to health care 
to urban development. 
For example, our Urban Investment Group (UIG)
has been a major investor in community development projects, committing more than $7 billion in underserved American markets since 2001. In 2018, UIG continued its long-term support of the Brooklyn Navy Yard
by committing $35 million to renovate Building 127,
a 95,000-square-foot manufacturing center that will drive the creation of approximately 300 quality urban manufacturing jobs. 
Last year, we announced Launch With GS, a
$500 million initiative to invest in women-led companies and investment managers. Through this effort, we are harnessing our deep investment expertise to narrow
the gender investing gap in three ways: committing firm capital in women-founded, owned or led businesses, directing client capital to invest in women-centered 
investing firms, and creating an ecosystem to help build future investment opportunities. 
More broadly, we have seen fast-paced growth in our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and impact investing platform, which reached $17 billion in assets under supervision at the end of 2018. This includes the launch of an ESG-focused ETF that provides our clients with broad exposure to U.S. large cap companies that rank favorably based on values identified by the American public. 
And as another example, at the end of 2018, we reached $80 billion in our goal to finance or invest $150 billion in clean energy by 2025. 
We are a financial institution, operating in global markets, with a global client base — and we have a real opportunity through that work not only to lead by example in how we run our organization, but to drive sustainable outcomes for our clients and for our communities. 
Looking Ahead 
Goldman Sachs of 2018 looks very different from the firm Marcus Goldman started a century and a half ago. Frankly, it looks different from when I started here nearly 20 years ago. One of the reasons that Goldman Sachs has succeeded for so long is that it reflects individuals who have been able to adapt with the changing times — from market professionals who see how the emergence of new 
technologies will create new price setting mechanisms to control-side professionals who react quickly to financial and regulatory changes in an effort to always maintain the firm’s risk profile and operational integrity. 
What initially attracted me to Goldman Sachs and
what has kept me here over the years is our time-honored culture that values teamwork, excellence and problem- solving; it has allowed us not only to survive, but thrive in an industry that is cyclical by nature. 
As we look to the future, we are building new businesses and reorienting the firm for a broader set
of opportunities. We have a robust approach to risk management and a strong balance sheet with the talent to deploy and protect it. We are investing across our businesses to serve new and existing clients and build upon an extraordinary client franchise. That’s why I am very confident of Goldman Sachs’ ability to generate strong, industry-leading returns through the cycle. 
"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2001,"In 2001, your company achieved solid financial results despite a weak economic environment and took major steps to accelerate internal growth, improve business execution and focus activities ever more tightly on the needs of our customers. 
Associates accelerated work to attract, retain and deepen customer relationships and to improve customer and client service throughout the company.
We launched a company-wide Six Sigma
quality and productivity program and continued
to reinvest savings in high-growth opportunities.
We installed a new business planning
process and a new approach to risk management
that we believe will bring consistency and predictability to our earnings.
We hired teammates from different industries who brought new skills to our company.
We adopted shareholder value added (SVA)
as a measurement tool to bring more financial
discipline to our business decisions.  We continued to invest aggressively in
efforts to build the Bank of America brand. In short, we are combining our heritage of ingenuity with an emerging culture based on
focus and discipline, consistent execution and
sustained intensity to serve customers better
while at the same time producing strong growth in total shareholder returns. 
Building Momentum. Our associates’ hard work in 2001 paid off, as revenue increased 5% to $35 billion, leading to an operating earnings increase of 2% to $8 billion, both impressive figures taking into account rising credit costs and the faltering economy. The lion’s share of earnings growth came from Consumer and Commercial Banking, which posted earnings of $4.8 billion, up 6.4% from 2000, driven mostly by gains in net interest income, service charges, card services and mortgage banking. 
Global Corporate and Investment Banking earnings rose 6.8% to $1.9 billion, reflecting an increase in fixed-income originations and increased market share in every major category of capital-raising transactions. Turmoil in the markets dampened results in the Asset Management Group, which held revenues steady, but saw earnings fall 11.5% to $521 million due to increased investments in the busi- ness. Equity Investments recorded a loss of $94 million. 
While our core businesses performed well, we made a strategic decision in the third quarter to exit the subprime real estate and auto leasing busi- nesses, both of which tended to produce volatile earnings and did not fit our objectives for prof- itability. We took a $1.3 billion after-tax charge to cover the costs of exiting these businesses. 
Credit costs continued to be our greatest drag on earnings. Net charge-offs, excluding charge-offs related to the exit of the subprime lending business, totaled $3.6 billion, or .99% of loans and leases, compared to $2.4 billion, or .61%, the year before. Deteriorating credit quality was largely limited to the corporate sector in the first half of 2001, but spread to the consumer sector as the recession deepened. We expect credit costs to remain high in 2002. 
The bottom line for shareholders, of course, is our stock price, and in 2001, we stood head and shoulders above the rest of the class. In a year in which the average stock price in our peer group declined 5%, your company’s stock increased in value 37%. 
Two reasons for heightened investor confidence have been our disciplined approach to balance sheet management and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
Throughout the company, we used relationship-banking and pricing incentives to boost deposits. At the same time, we reduced low-returning corporate loans on our balance sheet. The result is a loan-to-deposit ratio that today is lower than 1:1, which reduces inherent interest rate risk and enhances our ability to control funding costs in the future. We also continued to return capital to shareholders in 2001, nearly exhausting the stock repurchase program of 100 million shares that was approved by the board in 2000. At its December 11, 2001 meeting, the board approved further repurchases of up to 130 million shares over the next 18-24 months. The board in October also approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to $.60, or $2.40 annually, representing a 3.8% dividend yield based on our stock price at the end of the year. 
As we look forward to building on our
momentum in 2002, we are aware of the great 
uncertainty in our economy. No one knows
when the economy will bounce back from the
current recession, but we believe we have posi-
tioned your company well for the future. Our
capital strength and business diversity give us 
great confidence, and we’re gaining strength 
and speed even as we fight the current eco-nomic headwinds. As an expression of this confidence, we
recently committed to long-term financial goals OPERATING NET INCOME of more than 10% annual earnings-per-share $8.24
(EPS) growth, 20% return on equity (ROE) and
double-digit increases in SVA every year. 
The Right Moves. In last year’s report, I
wrote that we were investing in our company’s
growth engines and re-engineering business processes to improve our service to customers. 1999 In 2001, we undertook additional initiatives to
drive the organization forward. 
One of the most dramatic changes we’re making is in the way we are organized. In the past, we organized our activities largely by geography and by line of business, meaning by product or service. Today, taking a cue from our success with corporate clients, we’re changing reporting structures, compensation and incentive plans, and business processes throughout the company to reflect the customer’s view. For example, associate teams are not focused simply on products like mortgages or cards – or on a specific region or city – but on expanding relationships in a customer group, such as “Consumer,” “Small Business” or “Premier,” and on providing customers in these groups consistent, high-quality 
service regardless of where they live, where they happen to be when they contact us or what product or service they are inquiring about. 
This new way of looking at our business is changing the way associates interact with customers, design business processes and think of their roles in the organization. Instead of finding a product or a geographic label at the center of 
our operations, we are more often finding the customer at the center, and our customers are beginning to feel the difference. 
We’re making two other important changes in the way we run the company. 
To accelerate our process improvements, we are implementing the Six Sigma quality and productivity techniques that have proven effective in manufacturing and other industries but have not been widely adopted in financial services. Six Sigma provides our associates powerful tools to analyze business processes, identify problems, increase efficiency and reduce error rates. A signif icant additional benef it is our ability to constantly reinvest cost savings in new revenue- growth opportunities. 
We also have implemented an integrated business planning process that brings together four key elements of corporate planning: strate- gic planning, financial planning, risk planning 
and associate planning. Each of these processes is now designed to take into account the outcomes of the others. By integrating our planning, we believe the work we do across the company will contribute more effectively to the bottom line. 
We believe our new risk planning process, in particular, will dramatically improve the consistency of our earnings. In short, our goal is to make risk management a core strength of this company. We are now taking a more holistic view of risk than ever before by incorporating analyses of credit, market and operational risk into all strategic, financial and associate plans. Instead of finding a product or a geographic label at the center of our operations, we are more often finding the customer at the center, and our customers are beginning to feel the difference. 
Executive recruiting has been another priority, resulting
in a number of key hires in business-critical positions.
While some of these new teammates came from financial
services firms, many came from companies in other indus-
tries, such as manufacturing, shipping and consumer products.
These executives joined our already strong management
team, making us even stronger. They have brought skills
and knowledge to our organization that are
helping us improve revenue growth, business
processes, customer satisfaction and associate retention. We will continue to recruit top talent 17.7% aggressively from all industries where execu- 16.7% tives have the skills, knowledge and experience
to take our performance to a higher level. 
If fielding the right team gets us in the
game, motivating our players is the way to win. 
We are taking several steps to more closely align associate and shareholder interests.
These steps include shifting the emphasis for
bonus awards toward relationship-building and
away from pure sales goals; shifting 2002
stock option awards from an emphasis on time-
based vesting to vesting based on stock price  appreciation; and giving senior executives a pro-
gressively increasing percentage of their annual
incentive payment in restricted stock. 
Like measurement tools for associates, the
ways we measure corporate performance also impact our priorities and our decisions. For many years, like many companies, we have looked to the typical financial measure- ments to gauge our progress and our success – measures like revenue and earnings growth, earnings per share and return on equity. These measures are widely used for good reason, and we will continue to use them just as we always have. 
That said, we also are incorporating shareholder value added, or SVA, into our decision making, both at the corpo- rate level and throughout the business lines. SVA measures returns over and above our cost of capital. Simply put, we believe that SVA as a performance measure and a decision- making tool has an extremely high, direct correlation to 
stock price performance, and will help us do a better job of managing the company for the benefit of our owners. 
Finally, a word about the Bank of America brand. We believe strongly that a world-class company must have a world-class brand, and we have continued to invest in the advertising programs and sponsorships that build awareness of our brand across the nation. Perhaps more important, we 
understand that the real strength of our brand will be determined over time by the consistency and quality of the experiences our customers have when they do business with us. It is excellence in this regard to which we have all committed, and through which we all will help build a strong Bank of America brand for the future. 
Our Opportunity and Responsibility. 
Throughout this report, you will read about how we are working hard to grow customer relationships as a key strategy in our efforts to grow our company. 
Of course, we know that we are not the only large banking company pursuing a growth strategy based on expanding relationships. The strategy alone is no great secret and by itself will not differentiate us. What we’re focused on is execution and the impact our work is having on our progress toward becoming one of the world’s most admired companies. This is the 
goal I set for our associates last year when I became chair- man, and it is a goal that all of us are pursuing with vigor and intensity. 
I have said many times this year that the opportunity we have before us is the business opportunity of a lifetime – to take an organization that possesses the right businesses, the right strategy and the right people and turn it into one of the greatest companies in the world. In fact, achieving this goal is more than an opportunity. Given who we are, the position we occupy in the market and the name we do business under – Bank of America – I believe that achieving our goal is a responsibility. 
It is a responsibility not only to our shareholders, but also to our customers, who look to us to help them manage their financial lives and achieve their dreams; to our asso- ciates, who have chosen to employ their skills and talents here and who deserve every opportunity to reach their personal and professional potential; and to our communities, which are deeply invested in this enterprise, and upon which the future prosperity of our company rests. 
Fulfilling our responsibility to the communities we serve, of course, has always been a fundamental part of the way we do business. So I am pleased to report that we continue to hit our annual goals in our 10-year, $350 bil- lion community development lending commitment. The investments represented by this commitment are working to rebuild low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in cities across our great nation, from Baltimore to San Diego and from Miami to Seattle. 
I also am pleased that the Bank of America Foundation, long one of the most generous corporate foundations in the country, has adopted new guidelines for its programs that will focus resources in the coming years on a single issue: helping children succeed in life. In pursuit of this goal, the Foundation will support programs in early child- hood development, economic and financial education, and teacher development. The Foundation will be joined by every business group in our company as we pull together to prepare America’s youth to lead us toward a better future. 
As we work to prepare our future leaders, we also this year paid tribute to the man who led our company to where it is today. Hugh L. McColl, Jr. retired as chairman and CEO at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders last April. In 18 years as our leader, Mr. McColl transformed our company from a small, southeastern commercial bank to one of the largest and most comprehensive financial services companies in the world. Our job today is to take our company to a place on the world stage that reflects Mr. McColl’s vision – and we thank him for the opportunity. 
This spring we also celebrate the career of Bill Vandiver, a 35-year associate who provided leadership in many of our businesses over the years, most recently serving as 
Corporate Risk Management executive. Bill will retire on March 31, and will be missed by all of us who had the honor to work with him. 
Finally, I would like to thank our board of directors for the guidance and support they have given me in my first year as your chairman and CEO. In particular, I’d like to welcome John R. Belk of Belk, Inc. in Charlotte, Steven McMillan of Sara Lee Corporation in Chicago and Patricia Mitchell of PBS in Alexandria, VA, all of whom joined the board last April at our annual meeting, as well as Peter Ueberroth of The Contrarian Group, Inc. in Newport Beach, CA, who joined our board in June. 
One of the great challenges we all will face in the coming years is the new world in which we are living since the September 11 attacks on our country. Like all Americans, we worked hard on September 11 and afterward to protect and care for our teammates and fellow citizens. Tragically, not all of our teammates escaped the attacks unharmed. Liam Colhoun, Susan Conlon and Robert (Bobby) Hughes worked on our Global Securities Operations team in the World Trade Center and were lost in the attacks. All three were last seen either in the World Trade Center or in the immediate vicinity attempting to help others escape. These teammates and friends lived and died with honor, courage and valor, as true American heroes. Their actions live on as an inspiration for all of us. 
In closing, I would like to thank all those who have supported our country in this time of great national need. We will remember our heroes, and we all will work harder than ever to build a company – and a country – that honors their memory and their great sacrifice. "
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2002,"The theme of this report — Higher Standards — reflects your company’s commitment to the idea that in every endeavor, there is always an opportunity to raise the bar, to do something better than anyone has done it before. Our commitment to this idea is evident in the year’s achievements. 
In 2002, your company: 
•	Posted strong financial results in a challenging 
business environment; 
•	Launched exciting new products and significantly 
improved customer satisfaction; 
•	Outperformed its peers and gained market share 
in most of its major businesses; and, 
•	Won recognition from two major financial 
publications (U.S. Banker and American Banker) as the best American banking story of the year. 
We are fulfilling our vision for a fully integrated, multi-product financial services company, and that vision has not changed. We are more convinced than ever that clients of all our businesses want a financial services partner that offers unmatched convenience and expertise, high service quality, innovation and a variety of products and services delivered as a single relationship. We also remain convinced that such a company, when managed with focus, discipline and intensity, will produce strong growth and consistent, quality returns for its owners. 
Building and preserving trust. Producing quality returns was, as always, our top priority in 2002. But there was no denying the top story of the year in corporate America: 
a crisis of public confidence in the ability of American corporations to govern themselves effectively and ethically. 
When your Board of Directors launched an initiative
two years ago to review, redesign and formally adopt new governing principles, we thought we were simply setting new standards required to become a world-class company. We had no idea how rapidly these initiatives would become
a competitive advantage. Two years later, we have confidence in our governance systems and continue to refine our policies to ensure adequate independence, control and oversight of our company’s activities. 
Our governance structure enables us to manage all the major aspects of the company’s business effectively through an integrated process that includes financial, strategic, risk and associate planning. In particular, we made important changes in our processes for managing risk. As a financial services company, we are in the business of taking risk — whether we succeed depends largely on whether we take the right risks, and whether we get paid appropriately for the risks we take. 
We define risk broadly, including not only credit, market and liquidity risk — the traditional concerns for banks — but also operational risk, including risks related to systems, processes or external events, as well as legal, regulatory and reputation risks. In evaluating and responding to risk, we employ three lines of accountability to protect shareholder value: first, the line of business; second, Risk Management, joined by other units such as Finance and Legal; and third, our corporate audit function. 
Our management processes, structures and policies help us ensure compliance with laws and regulations and provide clear lines of sight for decision-making and accountability. But these disciplines represent only one side of governance. The other side, corporate culture, is even more important.
It is corporate culture — championed by leadership and sustained by every associate within the organization — that determines corporate ethics. 
One way we build and protect our culture is by aggres- sively promoting our company’s core values to associates at all times, as well as our Code of Ethics, which we updated last fall. But we also know that actions speak louder than words. And so, we foster a culture of openness, in which healthy debate is encouraged and associates are expected to blow the whistle on improper activity. We also do not hesitate to separate ourselves from individuals who violate our cultural standards and expectations, regardless of performance or potential. 
We believe results are important — but we believe how we achieve results is equally important. Our commitment to this principle is the key to sustaining the public trust and confidence in our company. 
Strong, consistent financial results. In 2002, your company’s associates produced net income of $9.25 billion on revenue of $35.1 billion, compared to $6.79 billion and $35.0 billion in 2001. While these are solid results taking into account continuing economic headwinds, we are highly focused on increasing revenue in 2003 as 
we pursue our long-term goal of 7% to 9% annual revenue growth. Earnings per share (EPS) were $5.91, shareholder value added (SVA) was $3.76 billion, and return on equity (ROE) was 19.4%; these results compared, respectively, 
to $4.18, $3.09 billion and 14.0% in 2001.
The result is a stock price for your company that continues 
to climb. In 2002, it increased 10.5% to $69.57 at year-end, a strong gain on top of a 2001 increase of 37%. Over a three-year period, Bank of America ranks number one in its peer group with a 15.9% average total shareholder return, including both stock price gains and dividends. 
Returning capital to shareholders continues to be a priority. In October, the board approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.64, or $2.56 annually, repre- senting a 3.7% dividend yield based on our stock price at the end of the year. In addition, we repurchased 109 million shares of stock in 2002, and the board authorized further repurchases of up to 130 million shares within 24 months at its January 22, 2003 meeting. 
As in 2001, our Consumer and Commercial Banking business (CCB) led the way for our company, with par- ticularly strong growth in card income, mortgage banking income and deposits. Our results in these businesses demonstrate the tremendous strength of CCB as a growth engine for our company. 
CCB posted earnings of $6.09 billion, up from $4.95 billion a year earlier. Revenue growth in CCB was 9%, including growth of 8% in card income and 27% in mortgage banking income. Average deposits grew 6% and consumer loans increased 16%. We also achieved significant growth in our customer base as net new checking accounts increased by more than half a million and active users of Online Banking surged to more than 4.7 million. Commercial loan levels declined 12% as companies paid down loan balances. 
We also took steps this year to open new markets and to expand our customer base in the consumer and small business segments. 
Last fall, we announced plans to open up to 550 new banking centers over the next three years, including 15 new banking centers in Chicago in the coming year. Banking centers continue to be the dominant channel for the creation of new banking relationships, and we are opening these centers in markets that offer the best potential for new growth. 
In December, we agreed to purchase a 24.9% stake in Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin (GFSS), the subsidiary of Santander Central Hispano in Mexico, for $1.6 billion. GFSS is the third-largest and most profitable banking organization in Mexico. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2003. 
This investment was driven by our desire to better serve Hispanic customers within our U.S. franchise and to increase our presence in all our Hispanic communities. Our relationship with GFSS will enable us to better understand our Hispanic customers, enhance our products and services and position Bank of America as the bank of choice for the Mexican-American population in our key markets. Finally, the investment met our stated financial hurdles and will be accretive to earnings in 2003. 
Our Global Corporate and Investment Banking business (GCIB), by focusing on clients in industry sectors with high growth potential and where we have specific expertise, gained market share in almost all of its major product and service categories. In particular, we gained ground in advisory services, equity offerings, convertibles, high-grade debt and asset-backed securities. 
Global Treasury Services continued to provide a strong, steady income stream for GCIB with a 26% increase in net income. Investment banking fees of $1.5 billion fell only 3% from last year, even as fees across the industry fell by double digits. Despite strong performance in GCIB relative to our competitors, lower demand in market-sensitive businesses (including a significant decline in trading profits), coupled with continued high credit losses, resulted in net income of $1.72 billion, a 12% decline from last year. 
Results in the Asset Management Group (AMG) also were deeply affected by the challenging economy generally and the double-digit decline in the stock market specifically. Net income from AMG fell 23% from a year ago to $404 million, primarily due to weak market activity and one large credit charge-off. 
These results masked important accomplishments for the business. Our mutual funds investment results put us among the leading performers in 2002, and assets under management remained stable at $310 billion while, again, major market indices fell sharply. AMG also made strong gains on its great- est priority: expanding distribution by increasing the number of advisors serving clients. Our goal was to increase our force of financial advisors by 20% — a goal we surpassed in 2002. 
Our ability to add resources and capabilities in businesses like GCIB and AMG demonstrates a great advantage of
our diverse revenue streams. During a year in which most market-sensitive businesses struggled greatly, our corporate earning power enabled us to continue to invest in our investment banking and asset management businesses. 
By adding program trading capabilities for our institutional clients and advisors in Asset Management, we continued to position these businesses well to lead their industries when markets recover. 
Your company’s financial results clearly illustrate the strength of our business mix. Steady earnings growth from our retail business combined with volatile but higher potential growth from our market-sensitive businesses enables us
to produce consistent results through strong and weak economic cycles. 
In fact, we now have posted stable or increased earnings per share in eight consecutive quarters. This is the kind of consistent, predictable financial performance that makes our company increasingly attractive to investors and also enhances our ability to plan and invest strategically for the future. 
More satisfied customers and clients. As pleased as I am about our financial results, I am even more encour- aged by the progress in our customer and client satisfaction measures, which provide the foundation for future growth. 
Last year in these pages, I wrote about our organic growth strategy, our intense focus on customer satisfaction and our Six Sigma initiatives for enterprise-wide process improve- ment. This year, I am pleased to report that our focus on quality and productivity is changing not only our culture inside the company, but also the way our customers view us from outside the company. For the year, the number of cus- tomers rating their satisfaction level a 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale — those we refer to as “delighted” — rose 10.4%, or 1.2 million customers across the franchise. Over the same period, more than one million fewer customers experienced problems with bank services, a decrease of 24%. 
In CCB, we’ve streamlined processes for deposits, payments and problem resolution. In AMG, associates are using Six Sigma to boost sales and revenue opportunities. And in GCIB, associates designed and implemented an automated, standardized client calling and pitch reporting system to enhance client relationship management and 
cross sales. We have hundreds more projects in the pipeline and plan to more than double the number of Six Sigma “Green Belt” and “Black Belt” projects in 2003. 
The result of all this work is more satisfied customers and clients, all of whom are more likely to purchase more products and services from our company and to recommend us to friends and relatives. But the benefits go further. While we will continue to invest in advertising to develop and support our company’s brand — we executed several very successful campaigns this year — we believe the Bank of America brand is created in the millions of experi- ences that customers have with our company every day. 
Every customer interaction — we have more than 150 per second — is an opportunity to attract, retain or deepen a customer relationship. And every interaction that results in a delighted customer builds the strength of our brand and our company for the future. 
The promise of Higher Standards. Bank of America is founded on an important idea: that people are at their
best when they are striving to exceed accomplishments
of the past. In our company, we have long talked about our commitment to redefining world-class business performance and standards of operational consistency, accuracy and efficiency. We have long insisted on continuous improve- ment and the sustained intensity that drives it, promising never to settle for an industry benchmark or our own historical performance. We have said our goal is nothing short of becoming the world’s most admired company. 
This drive to excel can be summed up in two words: Higher Standards. This is our goal in everything we do. Higher standards for our customers, who use our products and services to help manage their financial lives and achieve their dreams. Higher standards for our shareholders, who have entrusted us with their wealth and financial future. Higher standards for our associates, who have chosen to use their skills and talents here and who deserve every opportu- nity to reach their full potential. Higher standards for our communities, which are deeply invested in this enterprise and upon which the future prosperity of our company rests. 
Throughout our company, our associates are raising the bar for performance. Consumer bankers are pursuing product innovation for customers that makes home buying easier, and that offers unmatched financial security. Small business 
bankers are nurturing the grassroots of the American economy, and helping foster the entrepreneurial spirit in our multicultural communities. Middle-market, corporate and investment bankers are helping their clients raise the capital they need to grow their businesses and navigate today’s treacherous markets safely and successfully. 
These associates are led by an executive management team that includes seasoned veterans and rising stars from both inside and outside the financial services industry, several of whom won industry recognition for their tremendous results in 2002. Working with managers and associates throughout the company, we all are building customer and client rela- tionships and delivering the financial products and services our customers need to help them achieve their dreams. 
In regard to our focus on building relationships — the foundation of our corporate strategy — I will repeat what I wrote last year. We know that we are not the only large banking company pursuing a relationship-based strategy, and that the real game is execution. 
What’s different today is the evidence from our customers and on our income statement that we are, indeed, executing this strategy more successfully — and on a much larger scale — than our competitors. While the economic outlook remains uncertain, we believe we will continue to build
on our momentum, and will be well-positioned to further separate our company from the pack when stronger economic growth returns. 
In closing, I would like to thank our Board of Directors for their guidance and counsel during a turbulent year. 
In particular, I greatly appreciate the service of Ray Holman, chairman of Mallinckrodt, Inc. and Peter Ueberroth, managing director of The Contrarian Group, Inc., both of whom are retiring from the board this year. On behalf of all our associ- ates, I also thank our customers, who provide the inspiration for all we do, and our shareholders, whose commitment to and investment in this company make higher standards an ideal worth expecting, worth demanding and worth fighting for. 
As always, I welcome your thoughts and suggestions. 
"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2003,"Higher Standards, I wrote last year, is a phrase that reflects your company’s commitment to the idea that in every endeavor there is always an opportunity to raise the bar. In 2003, your company promised—and delivered— higher standards of performance for customers, share- holders and the communities where we do business: 
_	We produced strong revenue and net income gains in all our major lines of business, demonstrating the power of scale, execution and a sound organic growth strategy; 
_	We achieved significant gains in customer satisfaction across our businesses and customer segments, laying the foundation for accelerating organic growth in the future; 
_	We responded decisively to a regulatory
inquiry into mutual fund industry practices, demonstrating our commitment to strong governance, ethical conduct and our core values; 
_	We staked out a bold vision for the future with our agreement to acquire FleetBoston Financial Corporation; and 
_	We announced new 10-year goals for community development banking and corporate philanthropy unprecedented in our nation’s history. 
Our vision and strategy for your company has not changed. We are building Bank of America by offering our customers unmatched convenience and expertise, high service quality, innovation and a variety of financial products and services delivered as a single relationship. We are striving to exceed past accomplishments every day, in all we do. 
Growing the business, one customer at a time. 
In 2003, Bank of America was one of six companies in the world to post earnings of more than $10 billion. In surpassing this milestone, we increased net income for the year by 17%, revenue by 10% and shareholder value added by 49%, and posted a return on equity of 22%, beating our goal in each case. Our efficiency ratio for 2003 was 52%, close to our target of 50% and a small 
improvement from 2002. I hope you will review our financial results in more detail on Page 5 of this report and in the Financial Review beginning on Page 25. 
These financial results are significant. They are the product of the hard work and dedication of thousands of associates whose talent and commitment to a shared set of values give me confidence that we can continue to push our company to even greater heights in the future. I am immensely proud of our team’s achievement. What makes me even more proud is how we got here. 
For the past five years, we have followed a disci- plined organic growth strategy, pursuing growth by attracting more customers and expanding our relation- ships with the customers we already have. The execution of this strategy has required a constant focus on the voice of the customer, product and service quality, and process excellence throughout the organization. 
As those of you who have held Bank of America shares for the past few years know, we have sustained our focus on these priorities by institutionalizing quality and productivity tools and methods across the entire company. Foremost among these is Six Sigma, which is now being used within all business lines across the com- pany to measure and improve the results we produce for customers and shareholders. 
We have been successful with this approach for sever- al reasons. We committed to Six Sigma 100% from the beginning, made no exceptions and insisted that the result would be a fundamental and permanent change in the way we operate the company. We hired accomplished veterans from outside the company to accelerate results and aggressively trained our own associates in the disci- pline. We pursue new metrics to gauge the impact of our work, and we hold individuals accountable for results. 
Those results are impressive. Since launching our Six Sigma efforts less than three years ago, we’ve saved hun- dreds of millions of dollars in expenses, cut cycle times in numerous areas of the company by half or more and improved the percentage of customers who rate their satis- faction at 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale from 41% to more than 
50%, an increase of almost 2.5 million customers.
From a growth perspective, the benefits are clear. The cost savings and efficiency gains are immediately avail- able to be redeployed in growth opportunities in the market, and improved customer satisfaction leads to increased revenue that also can be directed to growth opportunities. We are investing in these opportunities aggressively in all our businesses, from Consumer and Commercial Banking, to Asset Management, to Global Corporate and 
Investment Banking. 
You can read about some of our initiatives and the results we are achieving in the stories that follow this letter. What these stories demonstrate is that better, more efficient, more consistent processes lead to better prod- ucts and services, more satisfied customers and clients, more revenue and net income, and, finally, stronger returns for shareholders. The numbers are in, and the conclusion is clear: Our strategy is working. 
Winning the right way. A commitment to winning is a strong part of our corporate culture. An equally strong part of our culture is a commitment to winning the right way or, as we sometimes say, “doing the right thing.” 
Last fall, our company was named in a regulatory inquiry into practices within the mutual fund industry. In 
an effort to protect our customers and shareholders, and resolve the situation as quickly as possible, we immedi- ately took the following steps: 
_ We launched our own internal inquiry;
_ We announced that we will make appropriate 
restitution to shareholders of any funds that are 
found to have been adversely impacted;
_ The Nations Funds board of trustees announced the appointment of independent individuals and firms to 
determine any monetary impact on the funds; and,
_ We dismissed several associates from the company. 
We run our company with strict adherence to fact-based principles of management, in which all individuals are held accountable for their decisions and their actions. I wrote at length last year about the confidence we have in our gover- nance and risk management systems and processes. I con- tinue to believe our governance systems are among the best in the world, even as we work every day to strengthen them. 
We will continue to do whatever is necessary to main- tain and build the trust and confidence of our customers, associates and shareholders. If we find something wrong, we’ll fix it and be better for it. In the final analysis, I believe we will be judged not by the actions of a few of 
our associates, but rather by the way we responded as a team to a violation of our shared values. We have no tolerance for decisions or actions that fail to put the interests of our customers, associates and shareholders first. Our actions will reflect this stance in the future, just as they have in the past. 
New teammates, new opportunities. On October 27, 2003, Chad Gifford, chairman and CEO of FleetBoston Financial, and I announced our agreement to merge our 
companies. We also announced that Chad will be the chairman of the board in our new company, while I will retain the role of chief executive officer. 
This combination of two of the oldest and most successful companies in U.S. banking presents us with a unique opportunity. With this merger, we are creating unrivaled distribution in America’s best growth and wealth markets. We will offer global reach through offices in 35 countries, with particular strength in Europe, Latin America and the Pacific Rim. 
Our company will feature increased earnings and revenue diversity, creating stronger, more consistent results for shareholders. It will create enhanced leverage of our technology and process capabilities, as well as investments like national advertising and research and 
development. The company will have broader distribution of wealth management products. And the management team will be the best in the industry. 
All that said, in my mind one of the most compelling arguments for this merger is our vision for a truly national bank that creates the opportunity for Americans across the country to choose the unprecedented conven- ience, quality and innovation we can provide. 
Ultimately, this merger is about delivering the combined capabilities of two powerful organizations to our 
customers, shareholders and communities. Customers will benefit from the broadest retail franchise in the nation, a shared commitment to service excellence, and a full range of traditional and innovative financial products and services. Shareholders will benefit from our presence in the best growth and wealth markets in America and unmatched diversity of revenues and resources. Our communities will benefit from our shared tradition of public-private part- nership, community development banking and philan- thropic investment in the communities we serve. 
Your company’s expansion into the Northeast marks an exciting new era in our history and the creation of what we believe will be the country’s premier financial institution. 
A tradition of leadership. I have said that after we merge with our new partners at Fleet, we will continue to be a leader, not only for our customers and shareholders, but for our communities as well. This commitment follows a long tradition at Bank of America of running our compa- ny with a clear understanding of the vital link between the health of our businesses and the health of the communi- ties in which we operate. 
Five years ago, we announced a 10-year, $350 billion commitment to community development lending and investing, at that time unprecedented in history. Since then, we have loaned and invested more than $230 billion in traditionally underserved American communities, put- ting us on pace to exceed our goal well ahead of schedule. 
This performance is why we recently decided to set a new, even more ambitious target: Bank of America will raise its community development lending and investing goal to $750 billion over 10 years starting in 2005, once again setting a higher standard for community develop- ment banking in our country. In addition, we will set a 10-year goal for philanthropic investment—something we believe no other U.S. company has ever done—of $1.5 bil- 
lion, an average annual increase of 40% over the combined 2004 philanthropy budgets of Bank of America and Fleet. 
Our escalating commitment to our communities is a demonstration of what we mean when we talk about the important idea upon which Bank of America is founded: that people are at their best when they are striving to exceed the accomplishments of the past. It’s this spirit of constant striving that has driven our country forward since its founding and continues to drive our company for- ward in our pursuit of higher standards of performance for our customers, our shareholders and our communities. 
In closing, I would like to thank our Board of Directors for their guidance and leadership during a year of great challenge and great achievement. To those who are departing the board as a result of the merger, I offer my sincere gratitude for all your contributions to our suc- cesses, past and present. To those who will continue with us, I look forward to all we’ll achieve working together in our new company. 
Finally, I would like to thank our customers, who grant us the opportunity every day to serve their financial needs; our associates, who work hard every day to build the company we all envision; and our shareholders, whose investment in this company makes our success possible. It is for all of you that we strive every day to set—and exceed—a higher standard. 
As always, I welcome your thoughts and suggestions.

Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2004,"Two great tasks defined your company’s efforts in 2004. First, we accelerated the execution of our organic growth strategy, creating value for shareholders by building and expanding millions of customer and client relationships across the country. Second, we acquired and began to integrate the operations of FleetBoston Financial Corporation, adding more than 6 million customers and greatly increasing our opportunities for value creation and future growth in a single stroke. 
Some observers outside the company saw strategic conflict or a kind of corporate ambivalence in these two tasks. We do not. 
In fact, we view our acquisition of Fleet as tightly connected to our ongoing commitment to organic growth. We said from the moment our two companies came together that our goal was not just to reduce costs, but to accelerate organic growth in the Northeast. And that’s just what we have done. 
At the same time, the momentum we have been building for several years with our customers throughout the company continued to grow. In our retail banking operations, continuing improvements to products, services and the banking center experience are driving customer “delight” and revenue to all-time highs. In our wholesale banking businesses, bankers are working together to bring a full range of investment banking products and services to more of our clients than ever before. In our wealth management business, we are expanding our financial advisor network and increasing market share across the nation’s best and fastest-growing wealth markets. 
While our associates are working within their lines of business to build customer relationships, they also are reaching out to work with teammates across the company to create new opportunities to deliver the full power of Bank of America to our customers. For example, investment bankers are working with commercial bankers to provide M&A advice to middle-market CEOs. Personal financial advisors are working with teammates across the bank to help us serve more of our consumer, small business, commercial and corporate customers with wealth management services. 
And last year, we launched an initiative called the Fixed Income Strategies Group that enables our Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking business to distribute fixed-income products through Global Wealth and Investment Management’s network of financial advisors serving high-net-worth and retail clients, expanding the suite of product offerings available to our clients. 
All this work is creating strong, consistent financial performance for our shareholders. You can read more about how our associates are working together to grow the company starting on page 9 of this report. 
Strategic vision, financial results 
Our associates are pursuing our vision of a nationwide, universal bank for consumers and small businesses; a full-service corporate and investment bank with global capabilities for our commercial and corporate clients; and a company that produces strong, consistent financial returns for its shareholders by delivering higher standards of service for our customers every day. Our financial results are evidence that, in this pursuit, we are winning in the marketplace. 
In 2004, Bank of America earned $14.1 billion, was the world’s fifth most profitable company and, with a market capitalization at year-end of $190 billion, was the second most highly valued financial services company in the world. Our results exceeded our goals in most important financial categories, including diluted earnings per share, net income, revenue and credit quality. I hope you will review our financial results in more detail in the financial summary 
on page 30 and in the Management Discussion & Analysis starting on page 33.
Our financial results in 2004 continued the strong returns we have posted for our shareholders over the past 
four years. In fact, we have met or exceeded the rising expectations of Wall Street every quarter since the beginning of 2001. From 2000 through 2004, our diluted earnings per share grew at a 10% annual rate, despite an economic slowdown and market turbulence that derailed many competitors. 
Our strong profit growth provides us multiple opportunities for capital deployment, which we pursue in three broad categories: investments in existing lines of business, acquisitions of other companies and capital returned to shareholders. 
Our internal investments are tightly focused on areas of the company with strong long-term growth prospects. Prominent examples include a $675 million investment beginning in 2005 in Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking, where growth priorities include expanding capabilities in debt sales and trading, client management, our equity platform, and our ability to serve clients’ needs in Europe and Asia. In Global Wealth and Investment Management, we continue to invest in sales and relationship management capacity. And in Global Consumer and Small Business Banking, we’re continuing to build out our banking center network as we move into new and fast-growing markets. 
Our most visible acquisition last year was Fleet, but our acquisition of National Processing Corporation was a great example of an effort to build scale and capabilities in an existing business. The addition of National Processing to Bank of America Merchant Services is enabling us to offer more payments solutions to our customers. As payments continue to shift from paper to plastic, the Merchant Services expansion has enabled us to strengthen our leadership position in the payments business. 
In deploying capital, we have complemented investments and acquisitions with an extremely shareholder- friendly capital strategy. Since 1998, Bank of America has returned more than $65 billion in capital to shareholders through a combination of increasing dividends and the repurchase of shares. Our dividend has grown at an annual rate of 13% over the past 27 years, from $0.07 in 1977 to $1.70 today, and our current dividend yield of almost 4% is among the most attractive in the industry. 
Our strategic vision and financial results have been rewarded in the marketplace. Over the past five years, our shares have appreciated faster than our peers’, faster than the KBW Banks Index, faster than the S&P 500 and faster than the Dow Jones Industrial Average. With an annualized total shareholder return (including stock price apprecia- tion and dividends) of 18% from 1999 through 2004, Bank of America has been an extremely strong investment. 
Growth in the Northeast 
When we agreed to acquire Fleet, we believed that by bringing our successful retail model to the Fleet franchise we could immediately start taking market share from our competitors, increasing customer satisfaction and generating growth in accounts and revenue. And that’s exactly what has happened. 
The results for our first nine months as one company, from April 1 to December 31, confirm that we achieved what we set out to do. 
For example, net checking account growth in the Northeast increased from about 35,000 in 2003 to about 200,000 in 2004, and savings account growth registered strong gains as well. Not only are customers giving us a vote of confidence with their purchase decisions, they’re also telling us their satisfaction is growing, which bodes well for future growth. Between June and December, customers in the Northeast who rated their experience in the banking centers a 9 or a 10 on a 10-point scale increased from 51% to 61%. 
We have been extremely pleased with our early results, and these results have been gaining in strength since we launched the Bank of America brand across the Northeast between August and December of last year. Even so, we believe our greatest growth potential in the Northeast lies before us, not behind us. Even given our strong results so far, our market penetration and share of wallet in Northeast markets remains low relative to potential business opportunity. This is especially true in Global Wealth and Investment Management, where we see significant opportuni- ties to grow by capturing more of our existing customers’ wealth planning business. 
The merger transition process itself has been, without qualification, the smoothest and fastest I have seen in my career. From the beginning, we planned and executed the transition and all associated projects with strict adherence to a disciplined Six Sigma approach, improving processes, driving down costs and enhancing quality and productivity along the way. 
We continue to face significant transition challenges and opportunities in the Northeast in 2005. We will meet those challenges and seize those opportunities with the same energy, enthusiasm and intensity that led to our success in 2004, and drive toward ever-higher growth goals throughout the Northeast for the future. 
Smart growth 
To generate strong, consistent, sustainable organic growth in financial services, achieving excellence in sales and service is half the battle. The other half is developing the art and science of risk and reward management as a core competency and competitive advantage. 
Today, your company is developing the skills and tools that enable us to grow by taking the right risks, and by getting paid appropriately for the risks we take. We are continuing to build a risk and reward management structure and culture of shared responsibility, in which every associate—from front-line bankers to risk managers to auditors— is accountable for managing risks to help the business grow. 
This structure is important in helping us manage credit risk, but we also apply it to a broad view of risk, including market risks and operational risks related to technology, systems, events, or legal, compliance and reputation issues. 
We believe industry-leading risk management means playing good offense as well as good defense. At the beginning of this letter, for example, I mentioned a partnership through which we distribute fixed-income 
products originated by Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking to the bank’s high-net-worth and retail clients through our network of financial advisors. This partnership wouldn’t work without a strong culture of shared accountability, effective governance controls, and the active participation of Risk partners and the Audit group in the business. 
The key message that our associates are embracing is that managing risk and reward is not about avoiding risk. It’s about taking calculated risks in pursuit of growth. Effecting a shift in our culture that encourages every associate to understand, anticipate and manage the full range of potential risks and rewards in their area—whether relating to a credit score, a market or interest rate fluctuation, a marketing opportunity or a regulatory issue—is a fundamental part of our strategy for growth. 
Leadership, past and future 
Your company is in business for many reasons.
We provide the financial capital that creates economic opportunity for individual families, for businesses, for 
the communities we serve, and for the global economy as a whole. As teammates, we help one another grow and succeed, personally and professionally. And, of course, all our work is aimed at generating strong, consistent and sustainable growth in financial returns for our shareholders. 
Playing a key role in leading your company to achieve these strategic and financial goals for the past 18 years has been our chief financial officer and vice chairman, Jim Hance, who retired from the company at the end of January. Jim has been one of the key architects of our company for the last two decades, and has been a major ambassador for our company on Wall Street and a major force within Bank of America driving for better results for all of our constituencies. I could not have asked for a better partner during my time as chief executive. 
Stepping into the role of chief financial officer is Marc Oken, who had served the company as principal finance executive since 1989. Marc has a sharp financial mind and a strong, confident leadership style that will serve your company well in his new role. 
Also retiring from the company is Chad Gifford, our chairman and my partner in the Bank of America–Fleet merger that brought Bank of America into New England and the Northeast. Chad is a tremendous leader who directed the growth and success of BankBoston and Fleet over the past 38 years. Chad remains on our board of direc- tors, and I look forward to his continued advice and counsel. 
Finally, we have two departures from our board this spring. Donald Guinn, chairman emeritus of Pacific Telesis Group, will retire from the board of directors at this year’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Don has been a valued director and a strong voice on our board since 1998, and has chaired our audit committee for the past six years. His leadership will be missed. And Steve McMillan, chairman of Sara Lee Corporation, has resigned from our board. I appreciate all Steve has done for Bank of America during his time as a director. 
In closing, I’d like to thank all our directors for their guidance during what has been a year of great progress and success. As we continue our work to deliver ever-higher standards of service and performance for our customers, our shareholders and our communities, I look forward to all we’ll accomplish together. 
As always, I welcome your thoughts and suggestions.

Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2005,"In 2005, your company demonstrated its ability to grow in a number of ways.
We accelerated growth by attracting, retaining and deepening more customer relationships in the markets we serve. We launched a number of initiatives that will 
create value by integrating our capabilities across the company. We completed our FleetBoston Financial merger transition in the Northeast, exceeding what we promised in almost every category. We became the first U.S. bank to invest directly in a major Chinese bank. And, our acquisition of MBNA Corp. closed on Jan. 1, 2006, making Bank of America the top provider of debit and credit cards in the United States. 
Our view is that there are many paths to growth, and the best companies pursue multiple strategies as market conditions change and opportunities arise. I will discuss our most important paths to growth in this letter. I invite you to read more about the work we’re doing for customers and shareholders in the articles that follow. First, a review of our key 2005 financial accomplishments. Strong financial performance. In 2005, we again set 
new records for revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, $56.9 billion, and net income, $16.5 billion, representing growth of 15 percent and 18 percent, respectively, over last year. Diluted earnings per share increased to $4.04, an 11 percent rise over 2004. Return on average common share- holders’ equity rose to 16.51 percent from 16.47 percent. 
Our greatest financial challenge in 2005 was the con- tinuing flattening of the yield curve, which is the difference between long- and short-term interest rates. As that differ- ence shrank, banks, which tend to price deposits based on short-term rates, were adversely affected. In essence, profit margins were compressed. We expect the yield curve to remain relatively flat in 2006, providing an opportunity for well-managed banks to differentiate themselves. 
Our strong performance has enabled us to continue our record of returning capital to shareholders. 2005 was our 28th consecutive year of raising our quarterly dividend, which in- creased by 11 percent to $0.50. Over that time, our dividend has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 13 percent. 
As I have always said, the bottom line on our performance is our stock price. While our total shareholder returns, 
which include our dividend, were in line with our peers, our stock price fell slightly this year as other stocks in our industry remained flat. I believe the two factors that weighed most heavily on our stock were the impact of the yield curve, which affects all banks, and our acquisition strategy, which has created uncertainty for some investors. 
On the first point, the yield curve is cyclical. It will steepen again, and net interest yields will rise accordingly. In the meantime, we have one of the best teams in the business at managing interest rate risk, and I believe we will continue to perform well relative to our peers regardless of the interest rate environment. 
The second point raises questions about acquisition selection, price and risk. We look at companies that can strengthen our position in a given market, which can be defined by customers, geography or product. We look to acquire products, technologies, skills or capabilities that will enhance our value proposition with both customers and shareholders. Of the many opportunities we have evaluated over the past several years, we believe that both Fleet and MBNA met our standards. 
Regarding price, we start with a sound financial analysis, requiring that identifiable cost savings and projected revenue gains will offset the proposed premium. 
We also consider our long-term view of the changing marketplace; the competitive landscape; whether the company represents a good fit with our business model, brand and culture; and the benefits that we believe will accrue to our customers and shareholders over time. 
It is in the context of all these criteria that we make an acquisition decision, and our track record over the past five years demonstrates both selectiveness and discipline in our decision-making process. 
While all acquisitions include elements of risk, our company has demonstrated our ability to execute effective, efficient and profitable merger transitions. We proved this point in the Fleet transition, which we executed on time and with greater expense savings and revenue gains than we originally forecast. I expect nothing less in the MBNA transition. And I am confident that we will take advantage of the growth potential our new teammates and customers from MBNA bring to our company. 
Growing with our customers. In December 2000 I told investors, “We are changing the basic thrust of our company from acquisition- and expense-driven to a more customer- focused, revenue-driven organization.” It would be easy to assume after our acquisitions of Fleet and MBNA that I have changed my position. 
I have not. 
Bank of America has the vision, the skills and the financial wherewithal to pursue growth opportunities when and where we find them. That fact does not lessen our commitment to attracting, retaining and deepening our customer relationships. In fact, I believe there are three characteristics that give us a particular advantage with customers and prospects: operational excellence, scale and scope, and innovation. 
Achieving operational excellence has been a top priority for years, and it is most evident in our pursuit of process excellence through our use of Six Sigma tools. Since we adopted Six Sigma as a core operating discipline four years ago, we have achieved billions of dollars in savings and rev- enue growth, shortened cycle times, reduced error rates and improved associate performance throughout the company. 
Scale and scope, in addition to creating efficiencies for investors, create a huge advantage with customers. Our nationwide franchise and unmatched distribution platform enable individuals and companies to do business with us when, where and how they choose. It also means that more customers and clients can keep their relationship with us intact even when they move their home or business. 
It is a truism in business that real growth requires new 
ideas. Our record of in- novation lets customers know we are constantly working to create value for them. 
In our retail busi-
ness last year, we had
success with a number of
innovative offerings. We
enhanced our SafeSend®
product, making it a free
relationship-building
service that enables cus-
tomers with a checking
account to send money
directly to individuals in
Mexico. We launched our
Keep the ChangeTM fea-
ture, which helps customers save by rounding up debit card purchase amounts and moving the change to a linked sav- ings account. And we launched our SiteKeyTM online security feature, which has won several awards. 
Our wealth management business introduced a new trust product for the mass affluent market last year. And our investment banking group introduced a new electronic trading service platform that provides institu- tional investors with automated access to diverse liquidity systems and venues. 
While innovation often relates directly to new products and services, we also are taking advantage of innovative thinking as we work in teams that span the company to create more value for customers and shareholders. Referred to generally as “Universal Bank Initiatives,” these projects require integrated planning and enterprise thinking to maximize the value of the company. 
For example, the “Mortgage Business System” is designed to enable us to originate a variety of asset classes and then move those assets into the hands of investors through our securities distribution capabilities. Our goal is to expand our ability to meet customers’ needs across all market segments and create more value for our shareholders by exploiting business opportunities that span the enterprise. 
Seizing new opportunities. As I wrote above, our commitment to growth by one means does not preclude our 
ability to take advantage of growth opportuni- ties by other means. In 2005 we again demon- strated our ability to act decisively and to maximize the value of the assets we acquire. 
Our top priority from the beginning of the year was to complete our transition work in the Northeast related to our acquisition of Fleet. Through the spring and summer of ’05, we execut- ed major systems conver- sions across all our lines 
of business, affecting thousands of associates and millions of customers and accounts, all without a significant hitch. 
Then, in June, we agreed to acquire MBNA. The oppor- tunities for growth in this acquisition are significant, from product and distribution benefits for customers, to revenue opportunities resulting from our combined strengths, to cost savings derived from consolidating our operations. For example, the combination of our distribution platform and customer base with MBNA’s products, affinity relation- ships and marketing expertise creates huge opportunities for our company. 
As the largest issuer of credit and debit cards in the country, we will have the opportunity to lead in the ongo- ing evolution of the payments system in the United States. This leadership role will result in many benefits, including greater negotiating leverage with partners in the process and the ability to develop and deploy new capabilities and technologies in the payments system. 
Also in the early summer, we agreed to buy 9 percent of the stock of China Construction Bank (CCB) for $3 billion, with an option to increase our stake to 19.9 percent in the future. Just as important, we have launched a consultative effort with CCB through which we will assist in their efforts to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness and bring their financial management and governance processes in line with international standards. 
Communities and leadership. As we pursue growth, we 
take our responsibility to our shareholders very seriously. And in consider- ing how we grow, we take our responsibility to our communities just as seri- ously. I’d like to highlight the work we’re doing to strengthen our communi- ties in two key areas: com- munity development and philanthropic investment. 
The year 2005 was
the first full year of
our nationwide, 10-year
goal to lend and invest
$750 billion in community
development. Our invest-
ments in low- to moder-
ate-income neighborhoods across the country spur economic development and reflect our commitment to neighborhood excellence. This initiative took on new meaning in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, when we committed up to $100 million to rebuild neighborhoods along the Gulf Coast. 
Philanthropic investment comes in two forms: money and time. Our charitable donations in 2005 exceeded $130 million, making us one of the most generous corpo- rations in America. And our associates, all of whom are encouraged to volunteer up to two hours a week in their communities on company time, spent hundreds of thou- sands of hours strengthening the communities in which they live. Most important, we are deploying these resources in conjunction with our foundation’s Neighborhood Excellence Initiative, which relies on the knowledge of local leaders to direct volunteer time and money to the organizations most critical to the success of individual communities. 
It is through the leadership of our associates that we are able to achieve higher standards of performance for our customers, shareholders and communities. One of our key leaders retired from the company in 2005—Marc Oken, who served as our chief financial officer. Marc’s contributions to our company’s success over the past 17 years have been great. I personally appreciate his commitment and leader- ship and wish him all the best. 
Stepping into the role of CFO is Alvaro de Molina, a 
17-year executive who most recently led our corporate and investment banking team in 2004–2005. Al’s sharp financial mind, communication skills and leadership ability will serve us well as he takes on his new role. 
We also welcome two new directors to our company. Joining us is Frank Bramble, former executive officer, MBNA, and the former chairman and CEO of Maryland National Corp. And, re- cently retired from the United States Army, 
General Tommy Franks joined our board in January. Frank and Tommy bring rich and diverse leadership experience to our team, and I look forward to their contributions. 
Retiring from our board are Charles Coker, former chairman and CEO of Sonoco Products of Hartsville, SC, and Edward Romero, former ambassador to Spain. Charlie joined the board in 1969, the same year I joined the company. His leadership, guidance and service have been a great benefit to the company for 37 years, and to me personally during my time as chairman. Ed also has made important contributions to our board in his two years of service. I appreciate all that Charlie and Ed have done for us, and I wish them the best in their future endeavors. 
In a year marked by challenge, opportunity and growth, I would like to thank our customers for their business, our investors for their trust and all our associates and direc- tors for the work they do for our company. I look forward to even greater achievements in the year ahead and, as always, I welcome your thoughts and suggestions. "
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2006,"To Our Shareholders 
2006 was another demonstration of the many paths to growth available to your company, and our proven ability to drive growth through the competitive advantages Bank of America brings to the marketplace. 
Our ability to innovate, integrate and execute to serve cus- tomers’ needs enabled us to grow our customer relationships last year. At the same time, our associates again demonstrated that few of our peers are as efficient, effective or profitable at integrating acquisitions to enhance shareholder value. 
Our efforts were recognized by investors, as our shares appreciated 16 percent during the year, exceeding the perfor- mance of the S&P 500 Index. 
Bank of America today is one of the largest companies in the world; we were the fifth most profitable company in 2006 with a net profit of more than $21 billion. But while we have built leading positions in many customer segments and product lines in banking, our market penetration is actually small, given our potential, in a number of areas, such as first mortgage lending, small business lending, capital markets and wealth management. 
These and other areas of opportunity are discussed in this annual report. Our new marketing platform, Bank of OpportunityTM, reflects our vision for Bank of America as a cat- alyst to create opportunities for all of our constituencies, from customers and associates to communities and shareholders. 
We are building a financial services company that offers the most convenient banking network for our retail customers coast-to-coast and a global capital markets platform to serve our corporate and institutional clients. 
We are building a company that consistently leverages information and market knowledge to innovate for customers and clients; that knows how to integrate its operations and businesses to create greater value for customers and share- holders alike; and that delivers the highest standard of service quality to consumers, businesses and institutions of all sizes. In sum, we are building a financial services company that people and organizations throughout the United States and around the world instinctively seek out to help them create, build, preserve and grow the wealth they need to seize their 
opportunities, achieve their goals and realize their dreams.
In this letter, I will discuss some of our strategies for ful- filling this vision, and I encourage you to review the articles that follow, in which we connect opportunities created for customers to value created for shareholders. First, though, I’d 
like to review some of our financial results from 2006. 
Strong financial performance yet again. In 2006 Bank of America earned a record $21 billion. While earnings were up 28 percent on a 30 percent rise in revenue, much of that increase was driven by the addition of MBNA. A better mea- sure of the year’s success was the 14 percent increase in diluted earnings per share. Adding MBNA’s results back into our 2005 financial results to create an apples-to-apples comparison, revenue was up 10 percent in 2006 while we controlled expenses and achieved merger-related savings. 
This strong financial performance has enabled us to continue our record of returning capital to shareholders. 2006 was our 29th consecutive year of raising our quarterly dividend, which increased by 12 percent to $0.56. Over that time, our dividend has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 13 percent. We also returned $9.5 billion to shareholders in 2006 by repurchasing shares. 
Last year’s financial results were gratifying, given external headwinds our industry faced in 2006 in the form of a flat-to- inverted yield curve and rising credit costs, which we will most likely continue to face in 2007. 
The yield curve continues to be flat to inverted. The curve represents the spread between short- and long-term interest rates and is an indicator of the opportunity that banks have to generate net interest income. 
We believe we are better positioned than many of our com- petitors in this environment. Our revenue mix is now more than 50 percent fee income, and this change in mix has allowed us to continue to operate within our long-term target of 6 to 9 percent annual revenue growth even as net interest income growth has been reduced to low single digits. 
The normalization of credit costs has long been anticipated. Credit costs have remained historically low across most seg- ments of the economy during the recent years of economic expansion. As net charge-offs and provision expense normalize, bank earnings will be pressured. 
We believe we are in a good position to weather any cred- it issues we currently see on the horizon. The breadth of our franchise across geographies, market segments, industries and asset classes makes our credit portfolio inherently diverse and granular. Our ability to distribute credit risk through the securitization of various asset classes adds further stabil- ity. And as our risk managers analyze information about our customers in ever more sophisticated ways, we can grow our portfolio without significantly increasing our risk profile. In fact, in some parts of our business we are actually saying “yes” to more customers while at the same time improving the average quality of our loans. 
Operating leverage is perhaps our most important answer to both the yield curve and credit costs. We have consistently demonstrated our ability to manage expenses and produce positive operating leverage — the difference between the rate of revenue growth and the rate of expense growth. This per- formance enables us to invest in our businesses even when revenue is under pressure. 
The company we’re building. At the beginning of this letter I described our vision for Bank of America. Investors tend to ask tough questions about our strategy that deserve answers: 
First: Is Bank of America too big to grow at attractive rates? Our answer: Absolutely not. 
While Bank of America is large in the aggregate, we com- pete in markets — defined by geography, product or market segment — in which our current share of the market is much smaller than the “natural share” we should expect given the size of our company. In the retail markets, that natural share is defined somewhat by our deposit share in a given geo- graphic market. Examples of product markets in which we have plenty of room to run include mortgage, home equity and small business lending. 
I would add that the geographic markets in which we have chosen to compete are the fastest growing in the country, providing more opportunity for us to 
grow our business.
While our wealth management business is large and grow- 
ing, we have a huge opportunity embedded in our current client base: clients who qualify for high service levels such as Premier or Private Banking but who have not yet chosen to take their relationship with us to that level. Outside our existing client base, the opportunity is even larger. 
One of the most important moves we made in 2006 to pursue growth in the wealth management business was our agreement to acquire U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion, a transaction we expect to close in the third quarter of 2007. As one of the oldest, largest and most respected private banks in the coun- try, U.S. Trust will combine with The Private Bank of Bank of America to create the leading private bank in the country. Clients of both our organizations will benefit from a more comprehensive set of products and services, and access to the broadest financial services distribution network in America. U.S. Trust brings to this partnership one of the strongest brands in the industry, which we are looking very hard at retaining. 
By focusing on these and other opportunities, we aim to generate strong, consistent organic growth across all our businesses. 
Second: Is Bank of America’s growth to be fueled primarily by acquisitions or by winning and expanding customer relationships? Our answer: Wrong question. 
A better question would be whether Bank of America is capable of generating revenue and earnings growth organically and through acquisition. And our answer is an emphatic “yes.” 
The strongest companies are those that have the resources, knowledge, judgment and skills to pursue multiple paths to growth. For the past nine years, we have focused primarily on generating organic growth through process improvement, increasing customer satisfaction and product innovation. At the same time, we have taken advantage of select opportunities presented to us to enter new markets. These acquisitions — Fleet, National Processing Inc., MBNA and U.S. Trust, scheduled to close in 2007 — add customers, capabilities and great new opportunities to grow the business. 
Today, there is nothing more important than executing well on our current organic growth strategy. Every other opportu- nity pales in comparison to the opportunity we have with our customers and prospects in our current markets. And yet, our ability to pursue multiple paths to growth is a great strength of your company, and will continue to be. Acquisition — when the likely returns to shareholders are attractive, the addition increases our potential growth and the risks are in line with the potential rewards — will always be on the table as a potential path to growth for our company. 
Third: Does Bank of America want to be a U.S. banking company or a global financial services company?
Our answer: Both. 
We view wholesale financial services as global. Our com- mercial, corporate and institutional clients are doing business around the world. We cannot serve these clients if we can’t provide the global reach they require, which is why we have corporate banking offices in 44 countries around the world, and why we are expanding our ability to provide more products in more places. 
Retail banking markets are largely local or regional. This is why we have invested in building market share within the U.S. markets where we have chosen to compete, even as we have divested foreign retail franchises where we felt our presence was too small. 
Our preference in fast-growing
foreign retail banking markets has
been to invest in the best-run large
bank in the local market, as we did
in Mexico, China and Brazil. This
strategy enables us to participate
in the growth of the market with a
local bank that brings appropriate
size and scale to the table; reduces
the operational risks that come with managing a foreign banking franchise; and provides the opportunity for us to develop relationships, learn from our partners in the market and explore alliances that can benefit customers and share- holders of both companies. 
Our acquisition of MBNA has created something of a corollary to this policy, in that we now own a foreign card opera- tion that is No. 1 in the United Kingdom. This business pre- sents prospects for growth in existing and new markets and offers additional insight into international retail financial services markets. 
Finally: What unique advantages does Bank of America bring to the marketplace? Our answer: Many. 
In addition to our people and our culture, which, taken together, represent our greatest advantage, we believe there are four additional key attributes that give us a unique advan- tage in the marketplace: 
The knowledge, insight and understanding we gain from working with the largest customer and client base in the industry drive our ability to innovate across all our businesses. We were named Outstanding Corporate Innovator of the Year by the Product Development & Management Association in recog- nition of our development of products like Keep the ChangeTM, free SafeSend®, Business 24/7TM and Affinity Banking. 
More than anything, it was client knowledge and innovation that led to our $0 Online Equity TradesTM, which we launched in October 2006. This product enables brokerage clients with a deposit balance of $25,000 or more to execute online equity trades with no fee. 
The size and scale of our franchise in the United States gives us a tremendous advantage, as evidenced by our sales growth across products and channels last year. Active online banking customers grew to 21 million, and active online bill payers grew to 11 million — representing 65 percent of the market of online bill payers with demand deposit accounts at financial institutions in the United States. First mortgage applications increased by 7 percent and home equity applica- tions increased by 14 percent over 2005. Customers opened 2.4 million net new checking accounts, which contributed to a net new account gain of 3.7 million. 
A key differential for Bank of America is integration. Our focus on integrating across the company enables us to create value that others miss. We are working to serve customers’ needs in ways that draw on the power of all our capabilities. Our associates pursued many cross-line-of-business initiatives last year, but none was more successful than the partnership between Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) and Global Corporate & Investment Banking (GCIB). By working together to integrate the delivery of financial services to clients with “core” relationships originated in either business, associates in these groups generated more than a hundred million dollars in incremental net income, proving that we can create value by work- ing together on behalf of our clients. 
Execution is a core strength. Our history and culture of superior execution enables us to get things done right — on schedule, on budget and in ways that enhance the customer experience. In 2006, we again executed a large, complex merg- er transition on time, under budget and virtually flawlessly 
for our customers. This year it was MBNA and our Card Ser- vices business. And our Capital Markets & Advisory Services business proved itself a major player in the leveraged buyout (LBO) market, participating in seven of the 15 largest LBOs last year, including the two largest LBOs in history: Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) and Equity Office Properties (EOP). 
It is the combination of these attributes that is enabling us to fulfill our vision for Bank of America — and that enables us to create opportunity and value uniquely for our customers and shareholders in all we do, every day. 
What’s on tap for 2007. The work we are doing in 2007 will include hundreds of important initiatives. I want to mention four broad categories of activity that cover most of them. 
First, we are continuing our intense pursuit of growth within all our businesses. These efforts include cross-line-of- business initiatives that create value for customers by com- bining capabilities across the enterprise, such as a universal decision engine that will bring efficiency and consistency to the credit decision process across a number of our large retail businesses. It includes investments we’ll make in our businesses, such as those highlighted in the articles that fol- low this letter. It includes executing our U.S. Trust merger transition flawlessly. 
The second item on this list is the most important thing we’ll do this year to drive growth: get customer satisfaction scores moving north again. Regular readers of this letter will recall that in the first three years after adopting Six Sigma process improvement tools and methodologies across Bank of America, the percentage of customers rating themselves highly satisfied (9 or 10 on a 10-point scale) rose on average across the company by 11 percentage points, from 41 to 52 percent. 
Two years later, those scores have hit a plateau. In response, associates throughout the company worked with customers throughout 2006 to better understand key driv- ers of satisfaction, and to reassess our efforts to drive satis- faction up. This year, every business has a refreshed plan to further improve customer satisfaction. The plans focus on 
value perception, service quality, operational excellence and problem resolution, and are tailored to the specific needs of customers served by each business. 
Each of our major lines of business has established a goal of leading its industry in customer satisfaction within the next two to three years. 
Third, Bank of America has long been a leader in devel- oping environmentally sustainable business practices, from energy conservation and recycling programs to the financing of green building initiatives to our hybrid vehicle purchase assistance program for associates. 
As one of the largest financial service providers in the country, the opportunity we see in the future is to finance and encourage the new products, services and technologies that will help meet future global energy needs. Our goal is to help our customers and clients take the lead in reducing green- house gas emissions, and to protect the physical environment on which economic activity depends. We will launch several programs in 2007. 
Finally, we are working harder than ever to help strength- en the many communities across the country and around the world in which we do business. 
In the first two years of our 10-year, $750 billion commu- nity development goal, we have loaned and invested more than $160 billion in low- and moderate-income communities across the nation. We are focusing loans and investments in key mar- kets in need of revitalization, and targeting grant support to strengthen local nonprofit organizations and to encourage asset building and financial literacy for consumers living and working in these markets. 
The Bank of America Charitable Foundation, one of the most generous corporate foundations in the world, donated more than $200 million in our communities in 2006, and is on track to exceed our 10-year, $1.5 billion goal for giving. 
T h r o u g h
program, the Neighborhood Excellence InitiativeTM, we have donated nearly $50 million over the past three years and are pioneering a new approach to corporate giving — marked by a focus on local priorities, funding flexibility and leadership develop- ment — through which we not only give more, but we also give more effectively. All these programs and resources are 
managed in cooperation by leaders at the corporate and local levels, to ensure we are maximizing the impact of our work in all the neighborhoods we serve. 
For more information on all our programs supporting the environment and our communities, I encourage you to visit our Web site, www.bankofamerica.com. 
Opportunity and leadership. All we do to create opportunity for customers, shareholders and communities is made possible through the hard work and leadership of our associates. 
One of our longtime leaders is leaving our company early this year — Al de Molina, who served as our chief financial officer through the end of 2006. Al served our company well for 17 years in a variety of leadership roles, and as CFO made great strides in bringing more transparency to our earnings and operations for investors. 
Stepping into the CFO role is Joe Price, a 14-year asso- ciate of the company. We are extremely fortunate to have had someone like Joe in the wings to take on this new challenge. Joe’s broad experience in the company includes service as our general auditor, leadership of the Consumer Finance business, key roles in Finance, and service as Risk executive for GCIB. Joe is straightforward, smart and has an incredible work ethic. I am confident he will serve the company well in his new role. 
We have one departure from our board of directors this year: Paul Fulton, chairman of Bassett Furniture Industries in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who is retiring after 14 years of dedicated service. Paul brought tremendous experience and insight to the leadership of our company over the years, and I appreciate all his counsel and guidance to me and to former leaders of our company. We wish Paul all the best in his future endeavors. 
As we begin 2007 with a fresh commitment to creating opportunity in all we do, I want to again thank our customers, our shareholders and the communities for their partnership and their trust. And I’d like to thank all our associates and directors for the hard work and leadership that enables us to achieve our goals. I look forward to all we’ll achieve working together in 2007 and, as always, I welcome your thoughts and suggestions.

Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2007,"TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS 
2007 was a disappointing year for our company. While our financial performance was very strong in the first half of the year, results in the second half were severely depressed by rising credit costs and the impact of the unprecedented turbulence in the financial markets. 
Despite the short-term fallout from the so-called credit crunch, I remain confident and optimistic about our competitive position and our ability to generate attractive financial results in the future. Our long-term growth strategy is working and has not changed: We are using market insight to drive innovation that creates opportunity and value for our customers and shareholders. 
Our earnings power from our core business activities is strong and growing. We are bringing innovative new products to market, taking market share and expanding customer relationships across the company. We plan to invest more in growth initiatives in 2008 than we did in 2007. And we have taken steps to build up our capital strength and liquidity, enhancing our ability to be opportunistic in the future. 
This was the first down year our company has suffered during my time as chief executive officer. And although I take comfort in the fact that our diversity of income, tremendous scale and efficiency will help us weather this storm better than most, it has still been a difficult time for our company. 
While the credit crunch and housing market recession in the United States have hit the entire industry hard, we offer no excuses for our performance. We escaped direct losses from subprime lending, which we had exited years ago. But we did experience large writedowns in the value of structured products backed by such loans, and our trading results were poor. 
As these issues became apparent, we moved decisively to mitigate our losses and reposition our businesses for growth. In October, we launched a strategic review of our capital markets business, the results of which I discuss below. 
In my career, I have not experienced a business cycle in which size, scale, revenue diversity and the ability to execute have been more important. Each of these attributes is a strength of our company. Each will play a role in determining the winners in our industry. And we are leveraging each of these strengths to our greatest advantage. 
I will review some of the ways we are pursuing our vision for Bank of America in this letter, and you can read in more detail about our work in the articles that follow. First, I’d like to review our financial results and the market developments that affected our performance so profoundly. 
A challenging year. The story of the 2007 subprime mortgage meltdown and credit crunch is well docu- mented, so I won’t recount it in great detail here. Suffice it to say that over the past several years, a combina- tion of low interest rates (which helped to create excess liquidity), looser home loan underwriting standards at many mortgage origination companies, the rapid growth of innovative and complex financial instruments in the capital markets, and ratings methodologies that often, with hindsight, did not reflect the true risks embedded in these securities led to rapid price inflation in U.S. housing — a bubble that had to burst. 
Many of us had known for some time that these accelerating trends were unsustainable over the long term. We took several steps in late 2006 and the first half of 2007 to adjust our business to evolving market trends. But what we didn’t know was how and when the cycle would turn fully, and how the market adjustments would play out. 
Now we know — the failure of several large hedge funds in July caused the credit markets to seize up completely in August. All market participants were impacted at the same time, and every deal was caught, as 
investors struggled to price risk in the market. Late in the year, ratings agencies aggressively downgraded mortgage-backed securities that had been rated AAA, which contributed to the large asset writedowns and financial losses across the industry in the fourth quarter. 
Two areas that hit banks hardest were collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, and structured investment vehicles, or SIVs. Both are financial instruments — asset-backed borrowings in the simplest view — that banks and investors have used to fund the mortgage markets. At Bank of America, our exposure in CDOs was significant. Writedowns of the value of these securities reached $5.6 billion, which was one major cause of our weak fourth-quarter performance. Our losses in SIVs, by comparison, were relatively small. 
The other major cause was the continued rise in credit costs, which drove rapidly expanding provision expense — money we set aside to cover loan losses — as consumer credit quality has fallen from historically high levels to more normal levels, affecting most market segments. 
These factors were evident in our financial results for the year. 
In 2007, Bank of America earned $15.0 billion, down from $21.1 billion in 2006. Earnings per diluted share fell to $3.30 from $4.59; revenue fell to $68.1 billion from $73.8 billion; and return on common shareholders’ equity fell to 11.08 percent from 16.27 percent. Our efficiency ratio, which had been in our target range (under 50 percent) for the past two years, rose to 54.37 percent. Provision expense rose 67 percent to $8.4 billion from $5.0 billion, as nonperforming loans and leases and net charge-offs rose to 0.64 percent and 0.84 percent of total loans and leases, respectively. 
The good news is that our core businesses continue to execute their growth strategies in the marketplace with precision and discipline. In Global Consumer & Small Business Banking, revenue rose 6 percent for the year, and noninterest income rose 13 percent. We added more than two million net new retail checking accounts for the second year in a row, opened nearly 14 million new Card Services accounts, became a leading direct-to-consumer mortgage and home equity originator and extended our leadership in the online banking and bill-pay business to lead the industry in mobile banking, with more than 600,000 active new accounts. 
In Global Wealth & Investment Management, revenue was up 8 percent for the year, as record brokerage income and a 26 percent increase in asset management fees produced a 10 percent rise in noninterest income. In Premier Banking & Investments (PB&I), revenue rose 9 percent on 22 percent growth in investment and brokerage services and 19 percent growth in fee-based assets. 
In Global Corporate & Investment Banking, net revenue from Business Lending rose 10 percent and average loans and leases rose 14 percent, demonstrating that we are making progress in deepening relationships with our commercial and corporate clients. 
It was our company’s diverse earnings mix that enabled us to remain profitable despite extremely challenging conditions. And it is our continued profitability, liquidity and balance sheet strength that have 
enabled us to sustain our dividend at a time when others have not. Overall, 2007
was our 30th consecutive year of raising our quarterly dividend, which increased by
14 percent to $0.64 per share. Over that time, our dividend has increased at a compound annual rate of 13 percent. 
To bolster our capital ratios in the first quarter of 2008, we raised almost $13 billion in two preferred stock offerings, and could have raised twice as much, demonstrating investors’ confidence in our company. Bank of America will continue to be character- ized by strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders, tremendous liquidity and a fortress balance sheet. And we are still focused on achieving our long-term financial goals, including 6 to 9 percent revenue growth, 2 to 4 percentage points
in operating leverage and 10 percent average annual earnings-per-share growth. 
Strategies for growth. Our job in 2008 is to manage through the current economic storm and use our advantages — size, scale, revenue diversity, innovation, integration and execution — to position the bank for rapid growth when the storm abates. Here are some highlights of plans and progress in our three major business lines. 
Global Consumer & Small Business Banking (GCSBB) 
I believe there are three keys to building a winning franchise in retail financial services: convenience, innovation and service quality. 
Convenience is a well-known strength of Bank of America. No company is more ubiquitous — we have by far the largest network of banking centers and ATMs in the United States, and we are No. 1 in telephone banking, online banking and bill-pay as well. Our products are also very easy for customers to use. For example, our online bill-pay product won the Webby People’s Voice Award for the second year in a row based on voting by the public, and Bank of America was named twice on IndexCreditCards.com’s list of top 10 consumer-friendly credit cards. 
Innovation has become a great strength of our company, in part because of the huge customer base that we serve. With more than 3,000 customer transactions per second, we know a lot about customers’ needs and preferences. We invest in the analytical work that turns that knowledge into actionable insight, which, in turn, helps us create new and better products and services that are attractive and meaningful to our customers. 
Examples from recent years have been Keep the Change®, free SafeSend® and $0 Online Equity Trades. In 2007, we continued to introduce new products with the launch of No Fee Mortgage PLUS (which eliminates most fees on conforming mortgages), Mobile Banking (which enables customers to bank with their cell phones), new Risk Free CD products (which include high fixed rates and penalty-free withdrawals) and the new BankAmericardTM (which offers more rewards points, no points limits and the most flexible rewards options in the industry). 
Service quality and customer satisfaction, of course, are critical. I wrote last year that after several years of consistent gains in customer satisfaction, we had reached a plateau in many of our businesses, and that each business was laying new plans to push scores even higher. Overall scores in GCSBB faced some headwinds from the expansion of our card business — customer satisfaction in the card industry tends to be somewhat lower than in retail banking — but scores have shown a positive trend since last March. Banking center scores finished the year at an all-time high, and overall consumer problem incidence rates from July through the end of the year were down 13 percent. 
In retail financial services, the result of a customer experience marked by convenience, innovation and service quality is customer loyalty. Loyalty leads to a growing customer base and expanded relationships with existing customers — just the right recipe for the organic growth that will drive our company forward in 2008 and beyond. 
Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) 
In many respects, Global Wealth & Investment Management is one of our greatest opportunities for
growth. This business includes Premier Banking & Investments (PB&I), which serves affluent clients through Premier Banking and Banc of America Investment Services, Inc., our brokerage; U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, which serves high-net-worth clients; and Columbia Management, our asset management team. In each of these groups, associates’ top priority is client relationship expansion — by working with teammates throughout GWIM and across the company. 
Premier Banking serves about 850,000 clients — although more than seven million Bank of America customers or households qualify for this higher level of service. One of the most impor- tant investments we are making is to grow our distribution and service capabilities so that we can continue to move qualifying customers from the mass consumer segment into PB&I. 
A key measure of success in serving affluent clients is whether they choose to bring us their investing business. At the end of 2007, about one-third of our Premier Banking clients had investment accounts with us. That number grew at an annual rate of 14 percent in 2007, while client balances have grown at a rate of 11 percent and self-directed brokerage assets were up 20 percent. 
One of our best opportunities to expand these relationships is retirement. The demographics are compelling: The first of the 78 million baby boomers turn 62 in 2008, and the over-69 
population will increase by 55 percent by 2030. This is where the money is: $15.1 trillion in total assets and an annual profit pool of about $35 billion. We are building our team to take advantage of this opportunity. 
The biggest news in our private banking business in 2007 was the acquisition of U.S. Trust Corporation. This acquisition creates the nation’s pre-eminent wealth management provider, U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management. The group manages more than $225 billion in assets through offices in 32 states, and we’ve been expanding the team in selected cities to better serve a growing client base. The opportunity here is large. While the group currently serves about 130,000 wealthy clients, this number represents fewer than half of the more than 300,000 wealthy families in the Bank of America footprint. 
Columbia Management’s $440 billion in assets under management supported the continued growth of GWIM’s total assets under management to more than $640 billion, and the group was recognized with five Lipper Awards for its mutual funds’ performance. Columbia’s investment performance contributed to our company’s growing brand as a strong player in the wealth management industry and lent momentum to the market share gains we made across our client segments. 
Global Corporate & Investment Banking (GCIB) 
Early this year, we announced the results of a strategic review of our investment banking business. This study was conducted to determine the right mix of capabilities that will enable us to most effectively serve our commercial, corporate and institutional clients, and provide shareholders with the best returns. 
We are aggressively implementing the recommendations of that study. Here are the highlights: 
•	We will continue to serve corporate, commercial and financial-sponsor clients with debt and equity capital-raising services, strategic advice and a full range of corporate banking services. 
•	We will focus investment banking and global markets coverage on areas of strength, leading to reduced activity in some structured products and refocusing of our international platform on debt, cash management and trading, including rates and foreign exchange. 
•	We made a decision to exit the equity prime brokerage business, which provides investment banking services to hedge funds. 
•	Our goal has always been to be the primary financial and strategic partner to our clients. That continues to be our goal today. Simply put, this business is important to us because we know it’s important to our clients. The changes outlined above will enable us to grow the business profitably and will make us a leaner and tougher competitor where we know we have the advantages necessary to win. 
•	Even before the capital markets meltdown in the second half of the year, our team in GCIB was reorganizing to better serve clients. One important step was to consolidate accountability within Global Commercial Banking for all aspects of client relationship management, including client revenue and profitability. At the same time, we consolidated credit and treasury management product delivery in a new team called Global Product Solutions. 
•	Client satisfaction scores in GCIB have been rising consistently — up a total of 25 percent over the past three years. We believe the combination of meaningful organizational change with the results of the strategic review will put this business — which continues to take market share — back on the right track for growth. 
Other paths to growth. As I’ve written here before, we believe the best companies have the skills, knowledge, resources and will to pursue multiple paths to growth. Each of the activities I’ve highlighted below represents a key part of our overall strategy for growth — by expanding the franchise, investing
in a fast-growing economic sector, claiming a leadership role in a key product category or helping to strengthen the communities in which we do business. 
Acquisitions 
Our acquisition of LaSalle, which closed last October, brings our company several immediate advan- tages. We now hold leading market positions in both Chicago and Detroit, the third and 10th largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States, respectively. We can greatly expand on the range of services available to our new consumer and commercial customers in these markets. Greatly heightened visibility in these markets also creates opportunities for our wealth management business. 
Our acquisition strategy over the past several years has been tightly focused on the markets that, according to extensive research, have the greatest potential to produce growth for our company in the coming years. We have methodically built leading positions in the most important wealth and growth markets, cornerstone products and key distribution areas to drive the company’s future growth. 
These include our acquisitions of FleetBoston (2004), MBNA (2006), U.S. Trust (2007), LaSalle (2007) and, later this year, Countrywide. 
Countrywide Financial Corporation 
In January, we agreed to acquire Countrywide Financial Corporation, a transaction we anticipate will close early in the third quarter of this year. This transaction will make Bank of America the nation’s leading mortgage lender and loan servicer, adding another key asset to what has become a long list of financial products and services in which we hold a lead market position. 
I’ve had a lot of people ask me why we chose to do this now. My answer is that now is the time — the price is right, and the deep due diligence we performed confirmed our belief that there is great long-term value embedded in Countrywide’s business. Countrywide has excellent technology, a huge distribution network and extremely talented associates who will help us build the best mortgage business in the country. The mortgage sector is weak today, but I’m confident that home ownership in America is a market we’ll be happy to lead over the long term. 
Financing the “green economy” 
Earlier this year, our company announced a 10-year, $20 billion initiative to support the growth of environmentally sustainable business activity. Much of this initiative involves efforts to reduce the environmental impact of our own operations and to build “green partnerships” with environmental groups, government agencies and our friends in the business community. 
What I am most excited about, though, is that the emerging and fast-growing green economy has the potential to drive future growth for our company. Fifty years from now, it’s likely that many of our current technologies will be obsolete, replaced by innovations that provide for greater sustainability. We are working with clients in existing and emerging industries to finance these new technologies, and the vast majority of our $20 billion goal is dedicated to this activity. 
We believe the United States should be at the forefront of this economic change, building the new industries that will lead the world to a cleaner, greener and more prosperous future. There 
is huge economic opportunity embedded in this shift, and Bank of America will benefit greatly from our decision to lead. 
Strong communities, strong markets 
One of the most important ways we apply knowledge, insight and innovation to grow the company is through the work we do to strengthen our communities. 
Through our Neighborhood Excellence InitiativeTM (NEI), part of the Bank of America Charitable Foundation’s 10-year, $1.5 billion goal for giving, we are creating a new approach to corporate philanthropy, including a focus on local priorities, funding flexibility and leadership development. Our associates also showed their leadership in community support, as the bank matched more than $20 million in 2007 in volunteer grants and associate gifts. The Foundation in 2007 again donated more than $200 million overall. 
We are excited about opportunities in 2008 to extend our philanthropic model into new markets in Illinois and Michigan, to sustain LaSalle’s generous level of giving, and to expand our community develop- ment work as we continue ahead of schedule on our 10-year, $750 billion community development goal. We 
view all these activities as the best examples of “doing well by doing good” — raising our visibility, building our brand, cultivating relationships and strengthening the neighborhoods on whose prosperity our success depends. 
Looking toward the future. A leader who has been central to our success for
38 years retired in 2007 — Gene Taylor, who served most recently as president of GCIB. Gene has been one of our most valuable contributors, taking on every challenge we have thrown at him, from assimilating acquisitions to running multiple lines of business. His unwavering eye on the client and his ability to bring out the best in his teammates have inspired many of us over the years. We will miss him. 
Our new head of GCIB is Brian Moynihan. Brian brings broad experience to the
role, including his successful work building our wealth management business over the past three years. Moving into the leadership role in GWIM is Keith Banks, who previously served as president and chief investment officer of Columbia Management. Keith brings deep knowledge of the industry and a direct leadership style that will help us accelerate our growth in this important sector. 
We have one change on our board of directors this year: Steven Jones, dean of the Kenan-Flagler School of Business at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has decided not to stand for re-election this year. Steve has provided valuable insights and counsel in his time on the board, and we appreciate his service. 
2007 was a tough year for our company. That fact, however, in no way diminishes my commitment to our business model and strategy or my confidence in our future performance. I continue to believe that by offering our customers unmatched convenience and expertise, high service quality, innovative products and services and a variety of financial solutions delivered as a single relationship, we will continue to cultivate loyal customers, and Bank of America will continue to grow. 
In closing, I would like to thank our customers and clients for your ongoing confidence in our ability to serve your needs; our associates, for your hard work and dedication to creating opportunity; our shareholders, for continuing to believe in our vision for growth; and our directors, for your wisdom and guidance through a very challenging year. 
I am looking forward to the remainder of 2008 and to our long-term future with confidence and optimism. As always, I welcome your thoughts and suggestions. 


"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2008,"2008 was an extraordinarily difficult year for our company. 
The economy, which had struggled for most of the year, hit a wall in the fourth quarter, posting the largest quar- terly decline in gross domestic product since 1982. Credit costs, which had been rising steadily all year, escalated as unemployment and underemploy- ment rose sharply. We expect credit costs to continue to rise this year. 
Trading results took a sharp turn for the worse as credit spreads suddenly widened in the fourth quarter. Trends in the credit markets are difficult to predict, but we are hopeful that a move toward normalcy will allow our capital markets operations to return
to profitability in 2009. 
These developments resulted in our first quarterly loss since 1991, and a sharp drop in our profitability for the year. 
In view of the challenging environ- ment, we took a number of difficult steps: We cut our dividend — which had increased every year since 
1977 — to $0.01. To lower our expense base, we accelerated and expanded our cost-cutting initiatives. The board accepted my recommenda- tion that no members of our Executive Management Team should receive
any bonus or incentive compensation for 2008. And, to help us close our acquisition of Merrill Lynch, we negotiated with the U.S. government
to invest another $20 billion in Bank of America in the form of preferred stock. 
I am very aware of the financial bur- den our decisions have created for our shareholders, but we felt it necessary to maintain our capital strength and stability in these uncertain times. 
Despite a year with no shortage of bad news, I maintain a positive and optimistic outlook for our future. 
Here’s why: For the full year, in
the midst of the worst recession in generations, we earned more than
$4 billion, ranking us second among
all U.S. financial institutions. Two of our three major lines of business made money (Global Consumer & Small Business Banking and Global Wealth & Investment Management). And Global Corporate & Investment Banking, which has weathered so much of the capital markets disruption this past year, came very close to breaking even. The point is that the potential earnings power of our company is still huge, and still growing. 
We made two key acquisitions. Countrywide gives us an opportunity to lead the mortgage market to a healthier and more stable future. Merrill Lynch,
I believe, is a tremendous long-term strategic fit for our company, notwith- standing the large losses they reported in the fourth quarter largely due to sharp writedowns in various capital markets instruments. 
I discuss both of these transactions in more detail in a separate section of this letter. 
Our top priority right now, as the economy continues to weaken, must be to build on our capital strength, so we’ll be in a good position to continue to support customers and clients.
Bank of America has been a strong and stable presence in the world’s financial system since this crisis started almost two years ago. The actions we’ve taken will help us maintain and build on that strength so that we can continue to play a leading role in the economic recovery to come. 
Much has changed and much will continue to change in our industry. Consolidation within and across sec- tors of the financial services industry has all but stopped with the financial sector in turmoil, but will accelerate when the market stabilizes and assets become easier to price. Old competi- tors have disappeared, while new ones are emerging. Structural and regulatory changes are slowing or reversing the evolution of the global markets. We are heading toward a simpler, more transparent financial services environ- ment. And a smaller and more humble financial services industry. 
Despite all this change — and, in some ways, encouraged by it — we remain committed to our core vision for this company. We are working to build a global financial services company that offers our customers and clients unmatched convenience and expertise, high-quality service and a variety of financial products and services deliv- ered as a single relationship. 
Unlike many of our competitors
in the financial services industry, we are well-capitalized, deposit-funded and extremely liquid. We have one of the largest, broadest customer bases in the industry. We have a diverse collection of market-leading businesses that help support one another through economic cycles. Most important,
we have a long history of managing successfully through economic and business challenges. I am confident we will do so again. 
Financial Results 
The deepening recession provides the context for our financial results. 
In 2008, Bank of America earned $4.01 billion, down from $14.98 billion in 2007. Earnings after preferred dividends and available to common shareholders were $2.56 billion, or $0.55 per diluted share, down from $14.80 billion, or $3.30 per diluted share, a year earlier. Revenue (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) rose 8 percent to $73.98 billion from $68.58 billion in 2007, from organic growth and the addition of U.S. Trust, LaSalle and Countrywide. 
Return on average common share- holders’ equity fell to 1.80 percent from 11.08 percent. Our efficiency ratio stayed well outside our target range (under 50 percent), at 56.14 percent. Provision expense rose $18.44 billion to $26.83 billion, 
and nonperforming assets and net charge-off ratios rose to 1.96 percent and 1.79 percent, respectively. 
There is no question that the reces- sionary environment is hurting results in all our businesses. And yet, the news is not bad across the board. The bulk of our losses in 2008 were the result of severe market and economic impacts in three of our businesses in particular: Mortgage, Home Equity & 
Insurance Services (MHEIS); Capital Markets & Advisory Services (CMAS); and Columbia Management. All of our other businesses were able to gener- ate a profit despite the harsh eco- nomic environment, and two actually increased net income in 2008. 
Within Global Consumer & Small Business Banking (GCSBB), Depos-
its and Student Lending net income increased 9 percent to $6.21 billion, and Card Services, which has been bat- tered by rising credit costs, still man- aged to post net income for the year
of $521 million. In Global Corporate & Investment Banking (GCIB), Business Lending posted net income of $1.72 billion (down 14 percent on higher credit costs), and Treasury Services net income increased 28 percent to $2.73 billion. In Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), U.S. Trust earned $460 million (down just 2 percent)
and Premier Banking and Investments earned $584 million (a 54 percent decrease due to higher credit costs). 
The ability of our associates in these businesses to generate sub- stantial profits in our current economic environment is a testament to their skill and determination, and to the advantages of our broad franchise. The profitability of these businesses also demonstrates why we value revenue diversity so highly in our business model. 
In times of severe financial stress, what financial institutions need more than anything is capital. Bank of America has, for years, been among the most well-capitalized banks in the world. But the fourth quarter of 2008 tested even our ability to maintain a deep well of financial resources. 
In early October, to shore up capital levels as credit losses accelerated,
we raised nearly $10 billion through the sale of common stock and cut our dividend on common stock in half. Then, in mid-October, the U.S. Treasury Department decided to use funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to inject capital directly into the nation’s banks through purchases of preferred stock. 
At the outset of this program, we accepted an investment of $15 billion. We also agreed at that time to accept Merrill Lynch’s initial share of the TARP funds, $10 billion, in early January. After discussions with federal govern- ment officials, the government agreed to provide an additional $20 billion in January to enable the closing of our acquisition of Merrill Lynch. 
All three preferred stock invest- ments will yield a dividend to the U.S. Treasury and have repayment terms for the full amount of the investment. We paid our first dividend to the U.S. Trea- sury Department on all three tranches of the TARP investment — a total of just over $400 million — on February 17. 
We believe that by accepting these investments, we should have the capi- tal and liquidity we need to absorb Merrill’s balance sheet and main-
tain our capital strength through the recession. The downside is that these obligations create a significant drag on earnings as we work to pay the government’s investment back, which we intend to do as soon as possible. 
Countrywide and Merrill Lynch 
We made two major acquisitions in the past 12 months that we believe will produce positive results for our company over time. 
We agreed to acquire Countrywide in January of last year. We knew that we were heading into a difficult eco- nomic period in which home mortgages would be at the center of an intense economic storm. We also knew that acquiring Countrywide would give us the best mortgage technology platform in the business; thousands of capable and experienced associates; and a leading market position in the United States in home lending — the founda- tional financial product for millions of American families in the most prosper- ous country in the world. 
The mortgage market needs to be reformed, and we are leading the effort 
to build a more stable home lending industry. We are leading the industry by creating new programs to mitigate foreclosures for homeowners under financial stress. Our decision to acquire Countrywide also has put us
in a great position to capitalize on the surge in this business, as low inter-
est rates bring borrowers back into
the market for home purchases and refinancings, and we are expanding our capacity to process new applications. 
All this activity is leading us toward an anticipated Customer Day One in late April, when we’ll begin rebranding all Countrywide operations as Bank
of America Home Loans. In time, the housing market will come back, and
I believe we will benefit greatly from being a leading home loan provider
in the country when it does. 
The businesses that came to us as part of Merrill Lynch are fighting through a very tough environment now. But we can’t lose sight of their underlying power. 
Merrill Lynch’s wealth management business is the best in the world. It has consistently outperformed its peers
in revenue per financial advisor and assets managed per advisor. Combin- ing Merrill’s productive capacity and industry-leading practices with our traditional banking capabilities and distribution network will make us a very strong competitor in this market. 
We now serve more than 4 million individual and institutional clients
all over the world, and manage more than $1.8 trillion in total client assets through more than 18,000 financial advisors. We will work to expand relationships on the wealth manage- ment side by offering the convenience and quality of our traditional banking services. And we will offer our banking customers the best wealth manage- ment platform in the world. Nothing that has happened in the past six months diminishes this opportunity. 
The investment banking business
is obviously under a lot of strain. And
it is likely that many of the markets
for complex structured asset-backed products will not come back in the foreseeable future. But we are focused on serving the capital raising and invest- ment banking needs of our commercial and corporate clients, and we are well-positioned to do so. 
Our combined business serves
99 percent of the U.S. Fortune 500 and 83 percent of the Fortune Global 500. We now approach the market as an undisputed global leader in whole- sale financial services, providing clients with lending, deposits, cash management, group banking, wealth management, debt and equity capital raising, syndications, mergers & acquisitions advisory services, risk management products, and securities sales and trading. 
We are already seeing business activity levels beginning to pick up. We now have leading positions in markets all over the world, and our investment banking team is among the most tal- ented and experienced in the business. 
On the far side of the storm we’re in, I believe there is tremendous opportunity in both of these acquisi- 
tions. And I am excited about working with our new associates to seize it. 
Managing risk and reward 
We are in the business of taking risk — lending to individuals and businesses to fuel the economy. It is also our business to manage that risk. Our industry as a whole did a poor job on that front in the lead-up to our current crisis. The institutions that did the worst job are no longer with us. Those that did a better job have endured. 
But no one I know of in this industry is crowing. We all have learned — or relearned — hard lessons. 
The challenges created by the 
economic and market environment do not excuse Bank of America’s perfor- mance. But they do help explain it. 
One of the biggest issues we faced over the course of the most recent growth cycle was the speed and degree of fundamental, structural changes that were happening throughout the econ- omy. New market participants were emerging and growing rapidly, including sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds and other global investors. Structured products, thanks to advancing technol- ogy, grew more complex by the day. 
The speed and volume of securities creation and trading increased expo- nentially. Markets and risks grew ever more interconnected. And the sheer volume of information in the system that needed to be tracked, monitored, analyzed and understood led to a grow- ing opacity — the opposite of what you want when you’re managing risk. 
As we work our way through the current cycle, we’re applying the lessons we’ve learned the hard way. 
One lesson is that we must not rely too heavily on mathematical risk model- ing in assessing risks. The models are sophisticated, but they are only as good as the assumptions of the people who create them, and only as well-informed as the data we feed into them. We have to balance our risk modeling abilities with what we know at any given 
moment about our customers, clients and portfolios; a commonsense under- standing of economic fundamentals; and our knowledge of business cycles. And we must have the courage to test the former against the latter when economic facts and risk assessments seem out of balance. 
Another lesson is that we need
to return to the fundamentals in our business. We are producing simpler and more transparent products to meet our customers’ current financial needs, and developing those that will help them when the cycle turns. We also are recalibrating our assessments of risk factors like customer credit- worthiness, portfolio concentrations and market trends to account for new economic realities. And we are using new tools to manage all these risks more effectively. 
Finally, we’ve concluded that, while organizational structure can be impor- tant in the way we manage risk, it is not the primary determinant of success. The most important factors are people and culture. When we have the right people in the right assignments — people with not only intelligence and insight, but also the courage to engage teammates on thorny risk issues — and when we have nurtured a risk culture that welcomes and encourages debate, we usually get to the right answer. 
Many paths to growth 
One of the most important ideas on which we’ve built this company is that diversity creates strength. Diversity of businesses, revenue streams, risks, ideas, perspectives and people brings strength to an organization that is hard to come by any other way. The same is true about growth opportunities. The more paths to growth we can pursue simultaneously and in coordination with one another, the more likely we’ll be to reach our goals. 
Earlier, I discussed our prospects
in home lending, wealth management and corporate and investment banking. We also are well-positioned to generate growth in our other two main business lines, Deposits & Student Lending and Card Services. 
We already serve half of all Ameri- can households, and we’re benefitting from a flight to safety, a powerful brand and rising customer satisfaction. In 2008, average retail core deposits (excluding Countrywide) grew by nearly $54 billion or 11.2 percent. Custom- ers opened nearly 5 million net new checking and savings accounts. For
the year, average balances in CDs and IRAs were up nearly 16 percent, and balances in money market savings accounts were up more than 18 percent. 
In Card Services, we are facing incredibly stiff headwinds in the form 
of rising credit costs. The opportunity we have in 2009 is to increase cus- tomer loyalty for the future as we help customers work through hard economic times. In 2008, we modified nearly 850,000 credit card loans, whether 
by lowering interest rates, reducing monthly payments or eliminating fees. We also continue to refer customers
to debt management programs. We believe our approach to helping our customers manage through hard times will pay off in retention and growth when the economy improves. 
Last year, I wrote here for the first time about our $20 billion environ- mental initiative. We believe there
is tremendous growth potential for companies that stake out a leadership position in alternative energy produc- tion and conservation. To that point,
we signed an agreement with a green- technology company that is helping us reduce our energy consumption in all our banking centers across the country by as much as 50 percent. And we’re supporting ventures that we believe will lead to abundant and renewable energy sources in the future. For example, 
we co-led an initial public offering for Ocean Power Technologies, a company that is engineering new technologies that will enable utilities to harvest and transport energy from ocean waves. 
We also are continuing to support our 
local communities through both commu- nity development lending and investing, and philanthropic programs like our Neighborhood Excellence Initiative (NEI). Through NEI, now in its sixth year, we have provided support to hundreds of neighborhood nonprofits, anchor institu- tions and community leaders through unrestricted operating grants and lead- ership development programs. 
Given the economic environment and the impact that the recession is having in neighborhoods across the country, we are working more closely than ever with community leaders to identify the most critical needs and gaps in local assistance programs and ensure that resources are flowing to individuals and families that have been especially hard-hit. For example, in 2008 we announced a Neighborhood Preservation Initiative offering grants and low-interest loans to nonprofit community organizations that will help borrowers stay in their homes through financial education programs and other outreach activities. 
Most important, we are not backing down from the goals we put in place last year to lend and invest $1.5 trillion over 10 years in low- and moderate-income and minority neighborhoods, and to give at least $2 billion over 10 years through the Bank of America Charitable Founda- tion. We believe it is critically important that we support the communities on which our future prosperity depends. 
Supporting the U.S. economy 
Throughout 2008, we operated with a strong belief that what is good for our communities and our country is also good for our company — and vice versa. 
Although every headline is telling us that banks aren’t lending, we extended more than $600 billion in new credit during 2008 to consumers, small businesses and large corporations. Obviously, lending volume is not what it was at the height of the boom. And it shouldn’t be. We’re in a recession, which means that demand for credit is lower, and credit standards are tighter. But that doesn’t mean “banks aren’t lending.” In fact, we’re out there in the marketplace making every good loan we can, growing our relationships with existing customers and creating new ones. 
We also have been a leader in fore- closure mitigation and loan modifica- tions, as we work to help individuals and families stay in their homes. In 2008, Bank of America and Country- wide modified approximately 230,000 home loans to avoid foreclosures, representing approximately $44 billion in mortgage financing. And we have committed to offer loan modifications for as many as 630,000 customers, representing up to $100 billion in financing. To help people keep their savings secure, we’ve opened millions of retirement accounts, CDs and savings accounts. 
All these activities are helping to provide support to the economy as
we work our way toward recovery. They also are helping Bank of America increase our market share across all our businesses, create relationships with new customers, and strengthen the loyalty of longtime customers. 
We are taking action to grow our business — and we are doing our part to support our customers, ease the credit crunch and stimulate the economy at the same time. 
How we got here — and
where we’re going
The financial services industry has undergone transformative, wrenching change over the past 18 months. In the blink of an eye, we’ve seen the demise of the independent investment banking business model on Wall Street; the failure or acquisition of many of the largest thrifts and mortgage lenders
in the country; and, to a great extent, the disappearance of some parts of the securitization industry for what
has now been more than a year. 
The industry that emerges from this crisis will look much different. It will have accelerated toward the “barbell” 
we’ve been predicting for years: a handful of very large, diversified, global firms on one end, and thousands
of small, local community banks on
the other. Credit markets will feature simpler, more transparent products. We will be a smaller industry, with fewer overall employees, and claiming a smaller portion of national income and gross national product. And regula- tion and oversight of the industry will be tighter and more conservative, especially in sectors of the industry that were lightly regulated before (e.g., mortgage lending, hedge funds, credit markets, non-bank consumer finance). 
The story of how we got here is the story of every great economic bubble in history. Every group of participants in the economy — lenders, borrowers, regulators, policy makers, appraisers, rating agencies, investors, investment bankers — had a motive to push
the cycle forward, and most did. The institutions that gave in completely to the frenzy around them, and engaged in the worst lending practices, are no longer with us. Those that balanced the need to compete with the need to maintain prudent lending standards — like Bank of America — survive today, and have provided a stabilizing effect in an otherwise unstable financial services industry. 
One of the greatest challenges our industry now faces is helping consum- ers deleverage their household balance sheets. For an industry that became too dependent on interest income 
to produce profits, the prospect of significantly lower consumer borrowing levels can be sobering. The answer, in my view, is for financial institutions to diversify their business models, creating a balanced revenue stream that includes both interest and non- interest income from a wide range of financial products and services that enable customers not only to borrow, but also to save and invest. 
Bank of America’s diversified business model should be a model for the industry. Because we offer a wide range of savings and investment products as well as credit products, we are not captive to an ever increas- ing need for interest income. There’s great credibility in being able to tell customers you want to help them achieve financial balance and finan- cial health when you have the product set to back it up. 
Diversification also will be helpful as the regulatory environment changes in the wake of our current crisis. A diversified revenue stream naturally exerts a stabilizing influence on earn- ings over time, which reassures those charged with overseeing the strength and stability of the industry. And diversification also protects against changes in the profitability of individual financial sectors due to changing rules and regulations. 
The universal bank model has come under a lot of fire over the past year. But my firm belief is that, when properly executed, the universal model will grow in favor as the strongest
and most viable in the industry. The successful universal bank will be one that achieves leading positions in the markets in which it competes; inte- grates operations to create value for customers; and creates a strong, bind- ing culture across the enterprise that supports the institutional mission. 
This is the strategy we’ve followed at Bank of America throughout my tenure as CEO. I continue to believe it is the strategy that will enable us to outperform our competitors when the economy finally strengthens. 
Looking toward the future 
Successfully executing our strategy, and managing through one of the worst economic environments in our nation’s history, will require an extremely capable, experienced and tight-knit leadership team. To that point, I’d
like to review some of the leadership changes we’ve had over the past year. 
Barbara Desoer, a longtime Bank of America leader, has moved to Calaba- sas, California, where she is leading the team that is hard at work reinventing the home lending industry. Barbara’s experience leading our Consumer Products and Global Technology & Operations divisions in recent years has prepared her well for this challenge. 
Bruce Hammonds, one of the driving forces behind the evolution of the card industry over the past three decades, retired at the end of 2008. Bruce successfully led our Card Services business since our acquisi- tion of MBNA in 2006. He has been succeeded by Ric Struthers, who helped create MBNA in 1982. Ric’s deep knowledge and experience in the card industry will be critical to our suc- cess as we reposition that business in a changing economic environment. 
Brian Moynihan, who led our Global Corporate & Investment Banking business during 2008, has taken responsibility for Global Banking & Wealth Management, including Commercial and Corporate Banking and Global Product Solutions. Brian, who led the rapid growth of our wealth management business for several years, is now focused on pulling together our teams from across Bank of America and Merrill Lynch as we build a leading presence in these businesses. 
Tom Montag, who joined Merrill Lynch in 2008 as head of Global Sales & Trading, will lead our Global Markets businesses. Before joining Merrill, Tom spent 22 years in a number of senior roles with Goldman Sachs. Tom’s expe- rience in securities markets all over the world makes him an ideal leader for our team as we work to build this business. 
We also have welcomed three former members of the Merrill Lynch board of directors to our board. Charles O. Rossotti is a senior advisor at The Carlyle Group and a former IRS com- missioner. Virgis W. Colbert is a senior advisor to the MillerCoors Company. Retired Admiral Joseph Prueher is a consulting professor at Stanford Univer- sity’s Institute of International Studies, and formerly served as U.S. ambassa- dor to the People’s Republic of China.
I look forward to their leadership and contributions to our company. 
We will have one departure from our board this year. Meredith R. Spangler, a director since 1988, will retire at our annual meeting. When Meredith joined our board, we were a regional bank called NCNB that operated in just a handful of Southern states. Over the 
past 20 years, she has helped guide our growth through at least a half-dozen transformative mergers and several business cycles. As a member of our Corporate Governance Committee, she has been instrumental in guiding the development of the standards and protocols through which we govern the company. And she has provided valued advice and counsel to both Hugh McColl, our former chairman and
CEO, and me in good times and bad. 
In short, during her time on our board, Meredith Spangler has been
a constant source of strength and wisdom to this company and its leaders. We are positioned to survive this economic crisis and be a global force in our industry in part because of her leadership. Her presence will be sorely missed, and we wish her only the best in all her future endeavors. 
2008 was one of the most challeng- ing years in our company’s history. 2009 will be a great challenge as well. But this is not the first time this company has faced and successfully managed through economic or business crises. We have a 225-year history of persevering during hard times, and positioning ourselves to be even stronger when economic growth returns. 
Despite the severity of our current challenges, I remain undeterred. I believe that our combination of strong 
businesses, leading market positions, diverse earnings power and talented associates will see us through, and that we will emerge as one of the strongest and best financial institu- tions in the world. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank every shareholder for your patience and continued confidence in our team and our company. Every associate at Bank of America is working together toward
a common goal: restoring this company to a position of financial and competi- tive strength. I look forward to reporting to you over the course of the year on our progress. And, as always, I welcome your thoughts and suggestions.

Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2009,"A Tough Year 
2009 was a difficult year by almost every measure. As the largest lender in the United States during the worst recession in 70 years, we knew 2009 would be a stern test — and it was. 
For the full year, we reported net income of $6.3 billion — a good overall result given the eco- nomic environment. After accounting for preferred dividends and the cost of exiting the federal government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $2.2 billion, or a loss of $0.29 per diluted share. 
TARP, and other actions by public officials, stabilized our financial system, and we’re grateful to U.S. taxpayers for making these funds available. We repaid the Treasury the full $45 billion for the TARP preferred stock investment in December. Government support of our company and the industry also carried a heavy cost for our shareholders. In 2009, dividends and fees associated with government support programs reduced our net income available to you, our shareholders, by $9.6 billion. 
At the same time, we faced high credit costs in 2009, as provision expense for the year totaled $49 billion. While credit costs will continue to be high in 2010, most credit quality metrics have begun to improve. Net charge-offs fell in the fourth quarter for the first time in more than four years. We think the economy will gain strength through the year, so we expect credit costs to improve. 
Despite the many challenges we faced in 2009, we came through the worst year for banks in several generations with net income up more than 50% over 2008. We strengthened our capital through a series of actions that increased Tier 1 common capital by $57 billion. And we moved ahead on our merger integrations — LaSalle is complete, Countrywide is close, and the Merrill Lynch transition is progressing on schedule and under budget. Bringing these projects to a successful close is critical as we look forward to putting all of our focus on customer and client satisfaction this year and beyond. 
Leadership in a Changing Industry 
Early in this crisis, it became clear that consumers across all our markets were frustrated with their banking experience. They wanted clarity, consistency, transparency and simplicity in their financial products and services. 
We’ve responded with Clarity Commitment® documents in our home loans and credit card businesses that explain in plain English the terms of each product or service; with limited and simplified fee structures in our deposits business; and with other changes that make it easier for our customers to manage their finances. 
In our capital markets businesses, we’re working with policy leaders on reforms for derivatives trading, securitization and other sectors that aim to improve transparency and accountability. We are working to ensure that reforms balance safety and soundness with innovation, and allow us to deliver the products our clients need to run their businesses. 
While we have always had a “pay for performance” culture, we have made important changes to our compensation practices to more closely align pay with long-term financial performance and enable the company to recover funds when risks go bad. 
We also have adopted an improved approach to risk management. Each year, the management team will recommend, and the board of directors will approve, an aggregate risk appetite for the company that management will then allocate across the lines of business. We’ve clari- fied risk management roles and responsibilities. We’re putting in place management routines that will foster more open debate on risk-related issues, and we’re taking action based on those debates. 
Before and during the recent crisis, many of our collective business judgments missed the mark. We believe the changes we’re making now will put us in a much better position to see and respond to macroeconomic risks in the future. 
We are moving ahead and making changes we believe are responsive to our customers’ and clients’ needs. And we are urging constructive dialogue with policymakers to make sure we’ll be able to continue to meet the needs of our clients, while at the same time protecting the future of our industry. 
Growing the Right Way 
There is nothing more important to our more than 280,000 Bank of America teammates and me than our belief that there’s a right way to do business — an approach that balances our responsibilities to all our stakeholders. This belief has guided our efforts as we’ve worked to help customers, clients and communities ride out the economic storm. 
Clearly, the most urgent need has been loan modifications, to help families and businesses manage their monthly cash flow to get through the crisis. We’ve reported regularly on our efforts to ease the crisis in home foreclosures, and we continue to accelerate our work to match the growing need. We lead the nation in the number of home loans we’ve modified — nearly 700,000 trial and permanent modifications since January 2008. 
Another key area of focus is small- and medium-sized businesses. In 2009, we lent more than $16 billion to these businesses, and we announced in December that we would increase lending to small- and medium-sized businesses by $5 billion in 2010. We also modified more than 60,000 small business card loans. In the current crisis, we believe this is not only the right thing to do, but that it’s also good business. A renegotiated loan is better than a defaulted loan — and we believe many of these customers will become loyal advocates for Bank of America as they get back on their feet in the coming years. 
That our company is taking this approach should not surprise anyone who has known or followed us over the years. A healthy sense of “enlightened self-interest” is a cornerstone of our culture, and continues to find life in our 10-year goals for community development ($1.5 trillion) and philanthropy ($2 billion), our industry-leading environmental initiatives and other endeavors. 
Our Vision for Bank of America 
Our vision for our company is simple. It’s Bank of America associates all over the world pulling together to create the right solutions for our customers and clients. It’s customers and clients telling us we’re the best by bringing us more of their business. It’s shareholders investing in our stock because they can see our bright future. It’s associates choosing to build their careers here because they believe this is the best place to work. It’s community leaders acknowledg- ing that Bank of America is the most important business partner helping to drive success in their communities. 
That’s what I mean when I talk about the finest financial services company in the world. 
We have the best domestic and global franchise in the industry, and capabilities across all our businesses that we believe meet or beat those of our competitors. Now, it’s all about execution — about meeting and exceeding our customers’ and clients’ expectations every day. 
Our great challenge is to take this large, diverse company we’ve built and make it the best in the business at helping customers, clients, shareholders and communities achieve their finan- cial goals. Helping our team meet this challenge by achieving operational excellence on a global scale is the goal I have set for myself as chief executive officer. 
I’d like to close by thanking Walter Massey and the board for their confidence in me as I begin my journey as CEO. Most of all, I want to thank our customers, clients and shareholders for your continued confidence in us. We take our responsibilities very seriously, and we are work- ing hard every day to win in the marketplace. 

"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2010,"Dear 
Shareholders, 
Our work in 2010 was focused on two key goals: first, rebalancing and realigning our company so
we can serve our customers and clients with the broadest and best financial services in the industry; and second, strengthening our balance sheet and capital position to create the right conditions for growth in long-term shareholder value. 
This work is well underway, and we are making significant progress. As a result, we are a much stronger company today than we were a year ago. We have a vision for our company, a strategy to achieve that vision and well-defined operating principles to help guide our work as we pursue our goals. These are important to understanding how we intend to operate the company, serve customers and clients, and return value to shareholders. 
Our Vision and Strategy 
Our vision is for Bank of America to be the world’s finest financial services company. We think that this is an appropriate and achievable goal. I firmly believe that we have all the businesses and capabilities in place to meet the core financial needs of customers and clients more effectively than any other company. 
Our success in realizing this vision will be measured by our customers, by our own employees and
by you, the shareholder. We’ll know we are succeeding when our customers choose to bring us more of their business, and make us their primary financial institution; when employees choose to build their careers here, because they can achieve anything they set out to do; and when shareholders realize the long-term value this franchise can deliver. That means solid returns on equity and assets, steady growth in tangible book value per share, attractive total shareholder returns, and consistent performance through economic cycles. 
To pursue our vision, we have laid out a clear strategy. 
We emerged from the economic downturn as a global financial services company with leading positions in all our major businesses. We serve one in two households in the U.S. and operate in more than 40 countries, with nearly 300,000 employees around the world. Despite our global scale and reach, our strategy is relatively straightforward. 
We serve three customer groups: people, businesses of all sizes, and institutional investors. For each of these groups, we provide core financial services. 
We serve people with a range of financial services, from secured and unsecured lending, to deposit, checking and savings accounts. We serve parents who want to help their children open their first savings accounts, young people graduating from school and setting up checking and retire- ment accounts, and the wealthiest families in the world with complex multigenerational wealth management needs. 
We help companies of all sizes grow by helping them transact, manage their cash, access the debt and equity markets, and manage the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuations. We provide strategic advice for transactions such as public offerings, and mergers and acquisitions. 
Our institutional investor clients rely on our research to identify opportunities to invest wisely and confidently.
We help them execute their transactions and connect them with the global financial markets through our sales and trading technology. 
No other financial services company has assembled
this breadth of capabilities for all of the customer groups we serve. And, our capabilities are at or near the top
of the industry in every core financial product and service we offer. 
We provide the full range of these financial services for all three customer groups in the United States. Outside the U.S., we deliver corporate and investment banking, global markets and wealth management services to business clients, institutional investors and wealthy individuals. Our Card Services business also serves customers in Canada, Ireland, the U.K. and Spain. 
We run the franchise for every customer in full, delivering all of the services they may have traditionally sought separately from a retail bank, a commercial bank, an investment bank, 
a wealth management firm, a brokerage or a private bank. We serve them on an integrated, customer-focused basis. 
That’s our strategy. Deliver leading core financial products and services to these three groups of customers. Do that repeatedly, leave nothing to chance, develop broad, deep, long- term, profitable relationships, and deliver long-term value to you. 
Operating Principles to Move Us Forward 
So, we have a vision and a strategy. To execute our strategy we have outlined six operating principles that will help guide our activities and focus our resources. 
Be a customer-driven company What does it mean to be a “customer-driven company”? It simply means this: We are making business decisions by listening to our customers and responding to their needs and preferences. 
Retail customers have told us that they want, and will pay for, value they can see and understand. They value clarity, choice and a healthy sense of security and control in their banking services. 
We have taken a number of important steps to help customers take control. We eliminated overdraft fees for debit cards at the point of sale. We created Clarity Commitment®state- ments that spell out in plain English key benefits and obligations of certain products. We offer deposit-image ATMs, and online and mobile banking technologies to provide customers with more detailed and timely information. Our new Merrill Edge®account enables customers to manage their banking and investing activities through an integrated platform. And we have developed employee incentive, reward and recognition programs that align with our customer experience goals. 
These are important steps as we build a consumer business driven by profitable relation- ships. Some of these actions have cost us revenue in the short term. But we also are working to mitigate revenue losses, whether due to our own decisions or regulatory and legislative changes. And, we are seeing immediate improvements in customer satisfaction, problem resolution and willingness to broaden and deepen relationships. 
In serving businesses — from our millions of small business customers to our largest corporate clients — the idea is the same: We believe we can create more value by pursuing broad, deep and long-lasting relationships. One very promising area involves our work to integrate the way we deliver wealth management products and services with the work we do for commercial, corporate and investment banking clients. Many of our business clients need employee benefits management, for example, or access to global capital markets and wealth management solutions. 
These efforts are paying off. Clients consistently tell me how much more they know we can do for them than our competitors. As a result, they are giving us more opportunities, and we are seeing a steady increase in successful customer referrals across our major lines of business. 
In focusing on expanding relationships, we exited several businesses that were not driven by the core financial needs of our customers and clients. Overall, we divested assets valued at more than $20 billion, strengthening our capital and liquidity position and allowing us to sharpen our focus on serving customers. 
Build a fortress balance sheet Maintaining a fortress balance sheet through economic cycles entails strong liquidity and credit reserve positions, good asset quality, sufficient capital and a diverse mix of core businesses. We have been improving in all these areas. Although we held assets relatively flat last year, we significantly reduced risk-weighted assets while also taking down long-term debt, growing deposits and strengthening global excess liquidity to more than $336 billion. Most important, we improved tangible common equity by more than 10 percent to more than $130 billion, and also significantly improved our loan loss coverage ratios. 
A key goal is to strengthen our capital base to meet new regulatory requirements without having to issue additional shares through the next economic cycle. Basel III rules as currently proposed will require a common equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 7 percent by 2019, a threshold we are confident we will exceed. 
Pursue operational excellence and manage risk well An important element in our strategy is achieving operational excellence throughout the organization. This is where the oppor- tunity to build deeper relationships begins. Getting it right for customers every time is how we build customer loyalty. With merger transition work largely completed, we now are free to focus resources on driving operational excellence for our customers by upgrading tech- nology, increasing training and improving effectiveness and efficiency in all the company’s core functions. 
Operational excellence in risk management is especially important, as we continue to build on our work to institute new, rigorous risk management controls and procedures through- out the organization. In combination with the improving economy, this work is contributing to our improving credit quality results. 
Deliver on our shareholder return model Our shareholder return model is not complicated — but it requires consistent and disciplined execution. It begins with the fortress balance sheet. The next steps are achieving reasonable and sustainable revenue growth from our core consumer businesses in the U.S.; faster growth in our corporate and investment banking and wealth management businesses in the U.S. and internationally; and tight expense control. 
We believe that consistently executing these steps will lead to less volatile earnings per share growth and steady capital generation. The end result, we believe, will be attractive growth in tangible book value per share and support for a higher multiple for the stock. 
We also believe that the implementation of this model will enable us to put in place a prudent capital management strategy in the near future that, pending regulatory approvals, includes
a higher dividend and stock repurchases. 
Clean up legacy issues related to the economic downturn, primarily in the mortgage business The recession took a great toll on millions of families. While growth has returned, we continue to work through issues related to the downturn — primarily delinquent mortgages. 
We are making progress. Bank of America (including Countrywide prior to the acquisition) has completed nearly 775,000 mortgage modifications since January of 2008 to help customers remain in their homes. 
We reached agreements at the end of last year with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to resolve many of their repurchase claims on mortgages originated by Countrywide before we acquired 
that company. We continue to work toward an appropriate resolution of repurchase claims held by private investors and monoline insurers. 
It is important to the economic recovery that the housing market stabilizes. That will require moving through the modification and foreclosure process quickly but carefully. We took
an important step in this direction in creating a new Legacy Asset Servicing group, which includes responsibility for residential mortgage repurchase claims and management of default servicing. This change will clear the way for leaders in our Home Loans business to focus on building the leading mortgage origination business in the country. 
In addition to mitigating mortgage issues, we also reduced certain capital markets risk expo- sures that were originated prior to the downturn to $23 billion in 2010. 
Be the best place for people to work We want to be the best place for our teammates to achieve their professional goals, while helping build the world’s finest financial services company for our customers and shareholders. 
To meet this goal, we are aligning our training, reward and recognition programs to our customer strategy. We made changes to our benefits programs to make health care cover- age more affordable for most of our employees; and, we continued to strengthen our leading diversity and inclusion programs to ensure that every member of our team can achieve his or her potential. We also conducted a company-wide employee survey (95 percent of our employees participated) that led to valuable feedback about what we can do to build an even more engaging workplace. 
Focused on the Future 
Our 2010 results show that, while we have made progress in strengthening the balance sheet and focusing our capital to support core capabilities for customers, the overhang of issues related to recent acquisitions and regulatory changes remained significant. Excluding two non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, we earned $10.2 billion for the full year. Including these charges, we posted a net loss of $2.2 billion. 
Even so, the underlying results show the strength and promise of the company. Credit costs fell, resulting in a reduction of provision expense to $28.4 billion from $48.6 billion in 2009. Deposit balances reached a record $1 trillion at the end of the year, showing that customers continue to see our company as a trusted and stable partner. And referrals among our businesses are increasing, demonstrating the power of our relationship-based, customer-centered strategy. 
As I wrote above, our company is much stronger today than it was a year ago, as we made tough decisions in 2010 aimed at putting issues related to the recession behind us. We have the number one or number two market position in almost every business in which we choose to compete. We serve millions of consumers, businesses and institutional investors, each
of which provides an opportunity for us to expand our relationship with them. We are leaving nothing to chance in our efforts to pursue these opportunities. 
For your additional information, we have posted presentations from a recent all-day investor conference in New York at which members of our management team and I discussed in detail the items I’ve outlined here. I encourage you to view the presentations in the investor section of our public website at http://investor.bankofamerica.com. 
As we build on the foundation we have laid, I want to thank our employees for their tremendous focus and effort over the past year; our customers and clients for giving us the opportunity to serve their needs; and our shareholders for your continued faith in the bright future of our company. 
We are guided by our vision, have a strategy to pursue it, and operating principles to keep us focused and to guide our growth. I welcome your feedback as we proceed.

Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2011,"To our shareholders, 
In 2011, in the face of significant challenges, we made great strides in transforming our company. We streamlined our businesses, built capital and liquidity and, most important, maintained or built
on market-leading capabilities to serve our customers’ and clients’ core financial services needs. Our com- pany has reduced risk and is less complex. As a stronger, more straightforward company, we are building deeper relationships with our customers and clients, and are doing what we can to help restore confidence and strength to our economy. 
In 2010, we established a clear goal — to be the finest financial services firm in the world in the eyes of our custom- ers, our employees and each of you as shareholders. There is ample evidence that we are making progress on the course we set. Our focus and strategy are clear: We deliver to three groups of customers and clients the leading capabilities they need to manage their financial lives and businesses. Simply put: We can do more for people, companies and institutional investors than any other financial services company. And day after day, we are proving it in the marketplace. 
Our financial results for 2011 show both the progress we have made and the challenges that remain. For the full year, the company reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2.2 billion, or $0.37 per diluted share, in 2010. Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis1, declined 15 percent
to $94.4 billion, reflecting, among other things, increased reserves for mortgage-related matters. 
Obviously, our stock price does not yet reflect the work we are doing to strengthen capital, reduce risk and attract more business from our customers. There are many issues weighing not only on us, but on the entire financial services industry. These include concerns about the global economy; a sustained period of near-record low interest rates; the implementation of new regulations and capital requirements; how these new rules may affect our ability to deliver for our customers and clients; and the time it will take to resolve mortgage issues. 
There is more work to do, but today we are better organized to serve our customers and clients; to offer customers more reasons to do more business with us; to earn the profits our shareholders expect; and to contribute to economic growth in all of the communities we serve. 
Continue to build a fortress balance sheet 
When we set out to transform our company two years ago, our first urgent challenge was to strengthen our foundation — the balance sheet. We focused on selling non-core assets, increasing capital ratios, building liquidity and reducing risk. 
Let me highlight a few examples of our progress. 
On December 31, 2011, our Tier 1 common capital ratio was 9.86 percent, up 126 basis points from the end of 2010, and double the level in 2007 as we headed into the economic crisis. 
During 2011, we increased our Global Excess Liquidity Sources by $42 billion to $378 billion, and we improved our “time-to- required funding,” which measures the length of time that our parent company could pay all unsecured contractual obligations without tapping external sources of funds, to 29 months from 24 months. 
We also reduced our risk in 2011 by decreasing risk- weighted assets by $171 billion to $1.28 trillion, including reducing legacy risk exposures in our Global Banking & Markets business by 35 percent to $15 billion. 
The result is a stronger, leaner company better prepared to handle economic uncertainty. 
The second urgent challenge we addressed was resolving issues related to the mortgage crisis. 
In January 2011, we announced agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to resolve representations and warranties repurchase claims involving certain residential mortgage
loans sold to them by entities related to Countrywide. In April, we announced an agreement with Assured Guaranty Ltd. to resolve all of the monoline insurer’s outstanding and potential repurchase claims involving 29 first- and second-lien residen- tial mortgage-backed securitization (RMBS) trusts where Assured Guaranty provided financial guarantee insurance. 
In June, we announced an agreement to resolve nearly all of our Countrywide-issued first-lien RMBS repurchase exposure with respect to 530 trusts with an original principal balance of $424 billion. And, in March 2012, we joined with the four other largest U.S. mortgage servicers in reaching global settlements to resolve federal and state investigations into certain origination, servicing and foreclosure practices. 
The progress we’ve made on these issues covers a significant portion of our exposure to issues related to the mortgage crisis and housing downturn. And while we still have more work 
to do on these exposures and other mortgage-related matters, we ended 2011 with almost $16 billion in reserves to handle the costs of mortgage-related representations and warranties claims. Resolving these and other claims will take time, but we are moving through these issues aggressively and resolving them in the best interest of our shareholders — settling when appropriate, and contesting them when we believe that is the right course. There is considerable disclosure on our mortgage exposure in the Financial Review section of this report, and I encourage all shareholders to review this section. 
Having made so much progress on the two urgent challenges of balance sheet strength and mortgage issues, our company is now better positioned to deliver on all our operating principles as we move forward in 2012. 
Being customer-focused 
Being customer-focused, in the broadest sense, simply means being responsive to the needs of customers and clients — providing the products and services they want, when, how and where they want them. 
To do this more effectively, we conducted an important reorganization of our company in 2011 when we named
two executives to newly created roles as co-chief operating officers. The intent of this reorganization was to better align our operating units to serve our three groups of customers. David Darnell, a 33-year veteran of the company who has led many of our businesses during his tenure, is responsible for those businesses that serve retail customers, wealthy clients and small businesses in the U.S. Tom Montag, who has led global wholesale financial businesses for more than 25 years, is responsible for all of our businesses that serve medium- sized to large companies and institutional investors worldwide. 
Retail customers put a premium on convenience, clarity, choice and value. Over the past two years, we have overhauled the design of our products and services to emphasize these attributes. Our customers have responded: Average deposit balances across our retail businesses grew by $20 billion in 2011 to nearly $663 billion, and we continued to see growth in consumer spending in our credit and debit card businesses. 
We also continued to help distressed mortgage customers, either by modifying loans to create sustainable, long-term solutions, or by helping them through a dignified transition
to new housing. We have now modified more than 1 million mortgage loans since the beginning of 2008, and Bank of America is now responsible for about one in three mortgage modifications in the country. This work is helping individual borrowers and supporting the recovery of the housing markets and the broader U.S. economy. 
We originated $6.4 billion in small business loans and commit- ments in 2011, and we hired more than 500 new small business bankers during the year to further support small business customers. We expect to reach our goal this year of adding 1,000 small business bankers to serve these customers and help our economy keep growing. 
We provided our affluent clients with a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, retirement, wealth structur- ing and trust services through our Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management, U.S. Trust and Merrill Edge businesses. In 2011, we continued to invest in these businesses to ensure we 
meet our clients’ needs, with the addition of more than 1,600 wealth advisors to our team. Our long-term flows of assets under management from these clients grew to $28 billion. 
Large companies and institutional investors need the best global corporate, investment banking and research capabilities integrated to help them achieve their business goals — and
we are delivering. We maintained our No. 2 global ranking in investment banking fees by working together to deliver the full capabilities of the company to our clients. We also continued to be a source of leading research and ideas for our institutional investor clients, as Institutional Investor magazine named Bank of America Merrill Lynch “Top Global Research Firm of 2011.” 
Being the best place to work 
We believe that by being the best place to work for our employees, they can better serve our customers and clients, which, in turn, will result in good returns for our shareholders. To put this philosophy into practice, we continue to improve 
training and career opportunities. In 2011, we placed tens of thousands of teammates in new jobs throughout the company, representing opportunities for employees to build new skills and benefit from new experiences. 
Every employee has had opportunities to share ideas for how we can be a better place to work through Project New BAC,
our companywide program designed to align our resources as efficiently as we can to better serve our customers and clients. These changes are not only making Bank of America more efficient, they also are making it easier for employees to do business and operate across the company. And, we have continued to earn recognition as an employer of choice from national and international publications, including Working Mother, Military Times EDGE, Black Enterprise and Latina Style. 
Our employees also continue to donate their time to their communities. We believe strongly in the importance of employee engagement in our communities, and we encourage employees to take up to two hours per week of company time for volunteer activities. Collectively, our employees logged 1.5 million volunteer hours (including company time and personal time) in 2011 and gave to many important causes through $25 million in individual donations as well as through the United Way campaign, which raised $34 million for community needs. 
Manage risk well 
Risk management is an integral part of our business opera- tions. Our goal is to set a tone and create a risk management culture in which every employee is empowered to raise an issue or express a concern. That means having a well-defined, clear-cut business model, a strategy that puts that model into practice, and operating principles to guide the thousands of daily decisions that are made by managers across the company. 
We have taken a number of steps to strengthen and sustain a strong risk management culture. We have developed a clear understanding of our risk appetite across all businesses. This includes seven major categories: credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk and reputational risk. We are putting specific emphasis on improving operational risk awareness and execution throughout the company this year. Finally, we are clear about accountability — all employees understand their obligation to speak up if they have a concern, and it is part of our culture 
to encourage it. 
Manage efficiency well 
To be the finest financial services company in the world also means we must be the best operator — a company that is efficient and effective, gets it right for customers and clients and, if an error occurs, corrects it promptly and courteously every time. 
At the heart of our pursuit of operational excellence is Project New BAC. We completed Phase 1 evaluations in September 2011, covering our consumer businesses and the related staff functions that support them, approving more than 2,000 ideas employees submitted to improve the way we work for customers. Many of these ideas are being implemented now. Through this work, we have a goal to reduce our expenses 
by $5 billion, or about 18 percent of the expenses in these areas, by the end of 2013. 
Phase 2 evaluations, covering Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Commercial Banking, Global Banking & Markets and the staff functions not subject to evaluation in Phase 1, are in progress. Evaluations will conclude this April. 
Deliver on our shareholder return model 
Ultimately, we will be judged by our ability to generate profits and by our stock price, which, as I’ve said, clearly does not yet reflect much of the work we are doing or the progress we have made. One important measure of our progress is tangible book value2, which, at $12.95 per share at the end of 2011, held steady over the course of the year even as we significantly added to our reserves for mortgage-related exposures. 
Looking ahead 
While our results in 2011 were lower than we would expect in a more normal environment, we are making progress in rebuilding profitability in all our core businesses. With the economy slowly but steadily improving, we believe this trend should continue in 2012. 
This year will bring its own mix of successes and challenges, but our direction is clear. We will continue to focus intently on what we can control: providing our customers and clients with the best service and most comprehensive financial services solutions in the market; managing our costs; and doing our part to keep the economy moving forward. Our long-term value will come through when we do that. 
As we proceed, I would like to thank our employees for their continuing commitment to this important work; our customers and clients for their confidence in our ability to deliver for them; and our shareholders for continuing to share our journey. 
As always, I welcome your thoughts and feedback as we move forward together. 
"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2012,"To our shareholders, 
Three years ago, we started on
a path to make Bank of America a less complex and stronger company. At the heart of our plan was a strategy to focus on the three groups of customers we serve — people, companies and institutional investors — and to become their primary financial services partner. 
Doing so required that we focus along two fronts: we had to strengthen our foundation and work through the issues that arose a__er the economic downturn of 2008 and were obscuring the promise and potential of our company. At the same time, we established a clear strategy to only do what is core for the customers and clients we serve, to be the best in those areas and drive growth. 
In addressing those issues and executing our strategy, we have transformed our company. 
A strong foundation 
We built a fortress balance sheet that gives us the platform to accelerate business growth. We reduced long-term debt by nearly $100 billion from the end of 2011 while maintain- ing significant excess liquidity of $372 billion. 
Our capital is at industry-leading levels. We ended the
year with a Tier 1 common capital ratio under Basel 1 of 11.06 percent, a more than 3 percentage point improvement from three years ago. Although the industry has until 2019 to meet the more stringent requirements of the Basel 3 standards, our estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio under those standards today exceeds the minimum requirement — six years before full implementation. We have simplified our company and we have more than adequate capital to support our strategic plans. We are well positioned to return excess capital to our shareholders and we believe that buying back common shares is the best way to continue to drive value
for our shareholders. 
We have narrowed our focus to concentrate on the busi- nesses and services that matter most to our customers and clients. We divested more than $60 billion of assets in non- core activities with no meaningful impact to core earnings and large improvements to capital ratios and liquidity. 
We continue to reduce risk throughout the company while maintaining a strong risk management culture. Credit risk measurements continued to improve in 2012. Loss rates were at their lowest levels in several years, reflecting improvements in credit quality across major consumer and commercial portfolios. 
Two years ago we began a program we call New BAC, to solicit thousands of ideas from our own employees on how to streamline the company, be more efficient in our opera- tions, reduce the red tape amongst ourselves and with our customers and, ultimately, to decrease our expenses. That work is well under way. 
In addition, we are focused on reducing expenses in our Legacy Assets & Servicing business. We have made significant progress reducing the number of delinquent mortgage loans and helping more than 1.5 million customers avoid foreclosure with modifications, short sales and 
other programs. 
In 2012, the number of 60+ day delinquent loans declined by 33 percent to approximately 773,000 loans. We expect to drive that even lower in 2013. That improvement has enabled us to shi__ resources to originate mortgages for our customers and reduce staffing levels in Legacy Assets & Servicing. 
As we reduce costs, we are investing in many areas of the company — including our industry-leading online and mobile banking platforms and in growth areas such as small business, mortgage, and wealth management. 
Our financial results for the year show the clear progress we’ve made as well as the impact of continuing to put
the Countrywide mortgage issues behind us. Your company earned $4.2 billion in 2012 compared to earnings 
of $1.4 billion in 2011. Our tangible book value per share also improved to $13.36 at December 31, 2012 from $12.95 at December 31, 2011.1 
While we are not yet where we want to be, our results reflect the underlying strength and earnings potential of the company that I believe will become even more apparent this year. 
A clear purpose 
We value the investment and trust each of you as sharehold- ers has made in Bank of America — and we believe you
own a great company. The capabilities we’ve built over nearly 230 years are second to none, and we can do more for the people, companies and institutional investors who choose to do business with us than any other financial services company can. Every day our team is hard at work proving it; taking advantage of all the capabilities, expertise and resources at our disposal to make financial lives better. Quite simply, that is our purpose — to make financial lives better, through the power of every connection. 
It comes down to one customer, one client, one interaction at a time. It comes down to delivering what our customers need and doing it flawlessly over and over again. 
It comes down to better connecting as a team and working together to deliver one company. Throughout this report,
we will share some stories that exemplify how we deliver for our shareholders through the power of our connections with our customers, our clients, and the communities we serve. 
Delivering one company 
Looking across every customer group we serve — whether a retail customer, an individual investor client, or a large corporate client — you can see how the work to deliver one company and the relationship strategy we’ve put in place are driving results. 
For people, we’re delivering products and capabilities our customers want in a targeted way that takes into account each customer’s relationship and preferences. One particu- lary exciting area is the growth we see in online and mobile banking. The number of mobile banking customers increased 
by 30 percent during the year to more than 12 million customers, and we are averaging about 10,000 new mobile subscribers a day. 
We also increased our specialized sales force of mortgage loan officers, small business bankers and financial solutions advisors to nearly 6,200 — providing customers improved access to specialists. As a result, deposits continue to grow and retail mortgage production was up more than 40 per- cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 from a year ago. 
Small business loan originations increased 28 percent to $8.7 billion for the year, reflecting our focus on supporting this key segment of the U.S. economy. Our preferred client growth was strong, with brokerage assets in Merrill Edge®
up 14 percent from a year ago. Wealth management revenue, earnings and pretax margin were also at record levels for 
the year. Both Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust had strong, increased client flows, meaning clients are doing more business with us. 
For companies, we are connecting them with our expertise and capabilities so they can do more and get the solutions they need. Loan growth expanded; commercial loans were up nearly 12 percent from a year ago. Investment banking fees are strong and we maintained our No. 2 global market share position for the third consecutive year. 
What really differentiates us is our ability to deliver leading capabilities and expertise across multiple products.
We served as advisor on some of the largest deals of 2012, including the second-largest equity offering globally — Japan Airlines, which is described later in this report. 
For institutional investors, we have the ability to serve clients in more than 100 countries. We trade in many mar- kets and provide research on more than 3,300 companies. Our research team was recognized as best in the world for the second straight year by Institutional Investor magazine. For the full year, sales and trading revenue did well in a tough environment. 
We believe the customer-focused strategy we’ve put in place is helping our customers and clients do more. It’s a strategy that at its core means listening to what our customers want and bringing together the full power of our company to help them get the solutions they need. 
Our team 
We believe that by being the best place to work for our employees they can better serve our customers and clients, which in turn will drive better returns for our shareholders. 
Every day I hear from customers and clients about how
our employees have made a difference — helping a small business get up and running, advising a family on a financial 
plan for college, or bringing a large deal to a successful close. But, I’m equally proud of the impact our team has outside the boundaries of our day jobs — the 1.5 million volunteer hours, the community renewal projects, and the monetary support for causes like education, hunger relief and job training. 
As we think about what the future holds, with the team we have and the company we’ve built, there is good reason to be optimistic and excited about what lies ahead. 
Our heading is set, our course clearly defined and we are pushing forward with the heavy drag of legacy weight greatly reduced. We have leading capabilities and expertise that enable us to outdistance the competition and win in the marketplace. We are focused on the horizon and committed to being better every day for those we serve, for the com- munities where we live and for each other. 
We are grateful to have you continue to share this journey with us. As always, I welcome your thoughts and feedback as we move forward together.

Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2013,"To our shareholders, 
In 2013, the earnings power of our company began to shine through more clearly. The strategy we outlined several years ago is driving growth as we better connect the outstanding capabilities of our company for the three groups of customers we serve: people, companies and institutional investors. We are helping our teams to connect more deeply with each other so that we can bring everything to bear that customers and clients need to live their financial lives. 
For the year, net income increased to $11.4 billion from $4.2 billion a year ago. These results are some of the best we have seen in recent years and a testament to the work the team is doing every day to win in the marketplace. 
Last year, Tier 1 common capital grew by 9 percent, and our regulatory capital measures exceed all long-term requirements. Liquidity and time-to-required funding also strengthened, and long-term debt has been reduced by more than $200 billion
from its peak, all of which enabled our company to return more than $3 billion in capital to shareholders last year through common share repurchases. We know this is important to you as shareholders and let me assure you the company is committed to returning excess capital over time through both repurchases and dividends. 
At the same time, we are making more loans, attracting more deposits, achieving record results in our wealth management business, and maintaining our leadership positions in investment banking. We continue to invest in many areas of the company — averaging about $3.5 billion in initiative spending each year for the past three years. 
We’re investing in our industry-leading online and mobile banking platforms. We’re also investing in growth areas, including small business and wealth management. And, we’re investing in the systems that serve our large corporate clients and institutional investors. 
We have commercial banking relationships with 83 percent of the 2013 Global Fortune 500 and 98 percent of the 2013 U.S. Fortune 500. 
While our earnings nearly tripled from 2012 to 2013, we know we have more work to do to reach our full earnings potential. 
As we think about the opportunities we have, we are focused on a very straight- forward purpose: to help make financial lives better, through the power of every connection. What you will see throughout this report are examples where we are doing that in markets across the United States and beyond. Everywhere we operate, our teams are exchanging information and opportunities about the customers 
and clients they serve, and we are tracking closely to ensure that we are giving those customers the opportunity to do with us all the things they must do to live their financial lives. 
The results are on vivid display throughout these pages...from a brewery in Brooklyn to a lumberyard in Los Angeles...from the second-largest mergers and acquisitions deal in history to supporting a company bringing clean water to the developing world...the stories here demonstrate the power of building relationships, the power of meeting our clients in the markets where they operate and connecting them to the resources they need. 
For people, customers benefit from our focus on helping them achieve their goals. Deposits and total client balances both are at record levels as clients are bringing more of their business to us. For the year, we issued nearly 4 million new credit cards and helped 365,000 customers purchase or refinance a home. Our wealth management business had a banner year with record revenue, pretax margin and net income. 
For companies, they understand the value in our relationship approach and see
it as a competitive differentiator. For the year, we extended $10.7 billion in credit to small business clients — an increase of 24 percent over last year. We also had strong commercial loan growth and our global banking loan flows have been growing for six consecutive quarters. Most notably, our investment banking team has had a consistent No. 2 global ranking for the past several years — and in the fourth quarter of 2013 we surpassed the competition to become No. 1. We advised on half of the top 20 deals of last year, including Verizon, HJ Heinz and Silver Lake/Dell. 
For institutional investors, we have the size, scale and global markets capabilities important to these clients. And, we have the No. 1 research firm in the world, for the third straight year. Our sales and trading platform is strong and
had $13.1 billion in revenue for the year — an 11 percent increase from last year. 
We are helping customers live their financial lives everywhere we serve them; in 2013, deposit levels reached a record $1.12 trillion while we increased our loans and leases by $20 billion to $928 billion, led by strong lending to commercial businesses. 
No matter where I’ve traveled, our employees have energy and optimism about the future. All over the world, our team is hard at work serving customers and improving the communities where they live and work. Last year alone, Bank of America employees gave more than 2 million volunteer hours investing in the causes important to them, fulfilling a longstanding tradition of volunteerism that our company is proud to support. 
All of these efforts are in keeping with our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) philosophy, which informs our company’s values and provides a platform to support partnerships in the public and private sectors, and reinforces our mission of helping local economies and communities grow and prosper. 
Whether it’s our partnership with (RED) to help end mother-to-child transmission of AIDS, or our work with military veterans to help them transition from active duty with jobs, training and education, or how we are improving financial literacy through our Better Money Habits program in partnership with Khan Academy, these and many other initiatives demonstrate our commitment to helping our customers, clients, employees and community partners address a wide range of issues that are important to them. 
Our financial advisors are deepening relationships with their clients. In 2013, our Global Wealth
and Investment Management business reported record revenue of $17.8 billion and record net income of $3 billion. 
As we look ahead, we will continue to pursue the same strategy that has served us well these past several years — a strategy to make our company more straightforward; a strategy to serve the core financial needs of our customers; a strategy to manage risk, maintain strong capital and liquidity, and to operate efficiently and reduce costs. This is what will drive results and progress. 
In the summer of 2014, Bank of America will celebrate 230 years of operations. Our company traces its roots almost to the very beginning of our country’s history. Today, our commitment to our customers and communities, and to help be an engine of economic growth, is as strong as it has ever been. 
We value your investment greatly and thank you for continuing to share this journey with us. 
"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2014,"To our shareholders, 
Thank you for investing in our company. During 2014, your investment increased in value by 15 percent. This follows gains of 34 percent in 2013 and 109 percent in 2012. Our goal is to continue to deliver long-term value to you, our shareholders, as we execute our strategy to serve our customers and clients. We still have lots of work ahead of us to get it back to a normalized level, but we are making good progress. 
Last year was again challenging for financial institutions. Sustained low interest rates continued to pressure net interest margins. Economic and geopolitical uncertainties continued to surface, causing markets, companies, investors and consumers to respond to volatility almost at a moment’s notice. And, our industry continued to face increasing demands for higher capital and liquidity, as well as changes to our business models. 
We started to address many of these issues five years ago — we trimmed hundreds of billions of dollars in assets from our balance sheet, eliminated dozens of non-core businesses, and increased our capital and liquidity so we could survive and operate in whatever crisis may arise. We also made tremendous progress on right-sizing our cost base for the revenue environment and managed risk well. Also, we settled most of the remaining issues related to the financial crisis, particularly in the mortgage space. 
Several issues continue to dominate the discussion around our industry, including “too big to fail,” questions about resolution plans, and new regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity. In addition, the need for state-of-the-art cybersecurity and other technologies means we must continue to invest in core security and innovation for our customers and our teammates. 
Living our purpose 
Despite these forces, if we stick to our core business strategies of serving our customers and clients, and providing an engine 
to help the real economy grow, then we will fulfill our purpose of helping our clients and customers live their financial lives by connecting and simplifying a complex world. 
That is what we have been doing for the past several years,
and we will continue to do so in the future. With this focus has come core high-quality and low-risk growth, a restoration of our brand, and shared success with our customers and clients. We also are seeing renewed energy in the communities in which we live and work. 
Maintaining and sharpening this focus takes tremendous discipline. I thank our board of directors, our management team, and our teammates around the globe for their hard work on behalf of our clients, customers and shareholders. Together with risk and operational focus, our ability to stay disciplined will serve us well into the future. 
So how did we do in 2014? 
We serve three groups of customers 
As we have discussed many times, we serve people (individuals), companies (large and small) and institutional investors. 
In the U.S. we serve all three customer groups, and outside the U.S., we have simplified and reduced our risk profile by focusing primarily on larger companies and institutional investors. 
As we discuss 2014, we will focus on how we improved our company for all of our customers and clients, and for you, our shareholders. 
Serving America’s families 
Our first group of customers is people. We serve millions
of individuals and families through our Retail, Preferred,
Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management lines of business. Together, these businesses produced revenue of $48 billion in 2014, about 57 percent of our total, and net income of $10 billion. 
2014 was a year of continuing to transform how we serve Retail and Preferred customers in the U.S. For instance, we are adapting to the mobile revolution and increasing our sales force, especially in our financial centers. Overall, we are offering more opportunities to help these consumers transact, borrow and save. 
Our consumer business is the best in the industry. Each week, customers interact with us more than 130 million times. The key to our success is serving each customer well, while making all of our capabilities available to them. We will keep simplifying our operations and reducing costs so we can provide the most effective, fair and rewarding products for these customers. 
We continue to invest in our mobile banking capabilities. As of February 2015, we have nearly 17 million active mobile banking consumer and small business customers. Each day, another 5,000 to 7,000 customers join our mobile banking platform. Each week, mobile customers send more than $3 billion in payments from their phones. And last year, more than 11 percent of all consumer checks we processed were deposited through mobile devices. We also introduced Apple PayTM to our customers in October to make payments easier and safer through tokenization, and more than 1 million customers have already signed up in just six months. We will continue to develop ways to help our mobile customers make secure, convenient payments. 
Our mobile customers are joined by about 31 million others who bank online via their computers. Each day, millions of customers log on at increasing rates to pay bills online, borrow through our direct online loan portal and invest through our Merrill EdgeTM platform. 
Last year, Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 18 percent,
and the platform continues to grow quickly for investors who are building their savings or want to play a more direct role.
We see this business as a strong complement to our two wealth management businesses — Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust. 
We also launched our Preferred Rewards program in 2014. Simply put, the more business a customer does with us, the more value we can provide them. This has been very successful in terms of assets gathered, but also in terms of improved customer satisfaction. 
At the same time, we continue to simplify our consumer business. This includes fewer but better offerings; overdraft policies and products that are fair and helpful to our customers; and our own improvements in efficiency. Last year, we reduced our consumer operating costs to a new low of less than 2 percent of total deposits, compared with about 3 percent a few years ago. 
Alongside the simplification work, we are investing in additional sales capacity to make it easier for our customers to interact with us and ensure we’re making all of our capabilities readily available. We’ve added thousands of sales specialists over the 
past several years and invested in new technologies, including tablet technology, to help them serve our customers. We’ve also invested in new retirement and financial planning capabilities and additional ATMs with Teller Assist. All of this allows for better service and more automation. 
We are expanding our Retail and Preferred businesses to markets we haven’t served, principally because a predecessor institution did not serve them. We opened our first financial center in Denver in 2014, and we are opening one in Minneapolis soon. We had a well-established presence in those markets already, serving clients in our other businesses (Merrill Lynch, U.S. Trust, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, and Global Corporate and Investment Banking), as well as retail customers with a mortgage or credit card, for many years. Having financial centers in these markets lets us better serve our customers and clients from well-integrated, modern branches equipped with the best technology and a well-trained sales force. 
Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust, our Global Wealth and Investment Management businesses, had another strong year. In 2014, the team produced record revenue of $18.4 billion and net income of $3 billion with strong margins. Client satisfaction continues to improve and advisor attrition remains very low. Together, these businesses have $2.5 trillion in customer assets, up 6 percent from the prior year. We had record asset management fees, strong client and market flows, and increased loan balances. These businesses continue to both provide and derive value through their affiliation with our broader company. 
We see examples of this everywhere. For instance, about
40 percent of new household clients that Merrill Lynch gained this year came as referrals from our other business lines. This shows the power of connecting our businesses. And we’re just beginning. 
Serving businesses, from the smallest
to the world’s largest companies
Moving to the businesses that serve companies of all sizes, we see continued progress. We serve these clients through three lines of business: Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, and Global Corporate and Investment Banking. Business Banking clients are smaller companies operating primarily in the U.S., while clients in Global Commercial Banking operate in the
U.S. and globally (more on that below). Global Corporate and Investment Banking clients are companies we serve globally. Together, these businesses, reported as Global Banking in our segment reporting, accounted for about $17 billion in revenue, nearly 20 percent of our total, and $5.4 billion in net income. 
A word about how these clients are changing. In general, a significantly higher number of companies we serve are operating globally than in previous times. While Global Corporate and Investment Banking clients have been active around the world for many years, we are seeing more of our U.S. middle-market clients in our Global Commercial Banking business doing so. We’re even seeing global activity among the smaller companies our Business Banking teams support. 
Some of these companies are looking to access capabilities and resources outside the U.S. Others are establishing manufacturing facilities nearer to the countries where they are selling their products, reducing the cost of delivery of 
their goods to overseas markets. Others are accessing more markets for their American-made products. Serving these increasingly global small- and medium-sized companies takes global capabilities — cash management or, with our sales and trading capabilities, helping these companies protect against currency fluctuations and counter-party risk. 
Our approach to serving these companies is the same as our approach to the individuals we serve — connect all of our capabilities to help them achieve their goals. Being able to do that globally puts our company at a competitive advantage with these clients. 
Our businesses that serve these clients provide great earnings stability to you as shareholders as we use our balance sheet to help clients prosper and benefit the economies in which they operate. Lending and cash management services provide strong returns. Our Global Markets capabilities also serve these clients by helping them raise capital efficiently and effectively, in the U.S. and around the world. As I’ll discuss, 
we have sized our capital markets capabilities to serve clients, not to take outsized proprietary trading positions. Those capabilities provide direct benefit to companies of all sizes, helping them access markets and grow. This is an efficient method of contributing to global economic growth. 
We also continue to invest and help business clients by offering the best means of managing their capital and making it easier for them to transact with their own customers. With our CashPro® Online payment application, we have created a better, more efficient experience for our clients and lowered our own costs by retiring aging payment technology. This is just one example of the focus we have to be simpler and to drive operational excellence. The results of these investments are seen in many ways, including recognition by Global Finance magazine as “Best Bank for Cash Management” in North America for the fifth consecutive year. 
Our integrated approach makes it more convenient for business clients to do more with us. In the work we do for our larger Global Corporate and Investment Banking clients, our teams advised on three of the top five global mergers in 2014. Other indications of greater activity with these clients are seen in higher average loan balances, which increased $13 billion last year to $270 billion, and higher average deposit balances, which grew $25 billion last year to $261 billion. 
Also, we are doing more for our business clients through
our Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust teammates working with
our commercial bankers. For example, the number of funded institutional retirement plans purchased by companies we serve grew by 53 percent last year, generating assets of nearly $9 billion. In addition, we have had thousands of commercial and corporate clients bring their private assets into our
Global Wealth and Investment Management businesses.
Our teams serving business clients are collaborating across our franchise to deliver all of our industry-leading products and services. As I said above, this work is just beginning. 
Balanced Global Markets capabilities serving institutional investors
Alongside the progress we are making in serving individuals and companies, our third group of clients — institutional investors — continues to benefit from the investment we are making in our sales and trading team and in our research platform of 700 analysts. For the fourth consecutive year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch was ranked the No. 1 research firm in the world by Institutional Investor magazine. 
We have reduced risk in Global Markets sales and trading operations over the past several years. At the time of the Bank of America merger with Merrill Lynch, the markets business had assets of nearly $1 trillion; and at the end of the year we were below $600 billion. All measures of risk in the business were low in 2014 and down significantly from a few years ago. Our mix of activities has changed, too. Most importantly, our focus is on enabling our investor clients to provide the capital and liquidity to companies and markets around the world, not taking our own trading positions. 
We do this by serving as the intermediary between our “issuer” clients (companies issuing debt or equity) and our investor clients (pension and retirement funds, for example) looking for growth and overall returns. We also see synergy with our wealth management clients in the research we provide to help them make investment decisions. These industry-leading platforms — providing ideas and analysis for investors, executing transactions in markets around the world, and helping companies raise capital and grow — drive the real economy in the U.S. and globally. All the while, the team continues to reduce risk, simplify the business, and produce higher-quality revenue and profits. Our goal is simple: We do not need to be the largest in the business, but we want to be the best for the clients we serve. 
A final thought on Global Markets. Some years ago we decided to report the results each quarter in Global Markets as its
own segment. We did this because we knew as we limited its size and scope relative to the rest of our company, investors in our company need to see that it remains a stable and 
solid performer even after applying the post-crisis rules and regulations to our operations. Reporting Global Markets
results separately also helps to highlight the seasonality and market-related changes in earnings that can affect this business from quarter to quarter. As we reduced the scope of activity 
in this business and aligned the business more closely to our client activities, we also brought our operating costs to a fundamentally lower level. This helps us to achieve acceptable returns in the business even at lower revenue levels. 
Finally, isolating the results in the Global Markets business allows shareholders a clearer perspective on the steady, consistent nature of the returns we see in our wealth management and commercial or corporate banking businesses, which derive synergies from the capabilities in Global Markets as described above, quite apart from the volatility in the sales and trading businesses in Global Markets. 
A strong company making steady progress 
In addition to the increased customer and client activity we are seeing in all eight of our lines of business, we continue to focus on the fundamentals. 
Balance sheet — We strengthened an already strong and
liquid balance sheet in 2014, ending the year with record capital and liquidity levels. Last year we increased our common stock dividend for the first time since 2007 and on March 11 we announced plans to return additional capital to our shareholders. 
Expenses — We completed the industry’s largest cost-savings program, achieving $8 billion of annualized savings. We continued to reduce expenses in our mortgage servicing unit. Noninterest expense, excluding litigation, declined $4.4 billion last year to $59 billion. We know we have more work ahead. 
Credit quality — Credit costs ended the year at a decade-low level. Net charge-offs declined 44 percent to $4.4 billion, and the provision for credit losses declined 36 percent to $2.3 billion. We have achieved this through high-quality underwriting. 
As you review this annual report, I’d like to leave you with a few final thoughts. We have built a company with leading market positions across every core customer segment served by our eight lines of business. We built disciplined processes to ensure we are connecting our customers and clients with all the things we 
can do to help them live their financial lives — getting more from the whole than is achievable from the parts. And we are mindful of managing our expenses tightly to create the operating leverage we need to keep investing in our businesses, and to return excess capital to shareholders over time. Finally, through such innovations as green bonds, social impact investing products and SafeBalance Banking®, which helps customers avoid overdrafting, we are guided by the principles of simplicity, transparency and fairness in our business practices. This focus on business-driven corporate social responsibility helps to maintain the trust of our communities and customers. 
Delivering responsible growth 
With this progress, we are well positioned to continue
building our responsible growth platform into 2015 and
beyond. Responsible growth has several key tenets based
on the premise that we know we must continue to win in
the market. By meeting the core financial services needs of
our customers and clients, we will ensure that our growth is customer-driven and is connecting them to the real economy
in the markets where we operate. Responsible growth also means that we must continue to operate within the appropriate risk parameters. And, finally, responsible growth must come from activities that are sustainable, meaning we have built 
the scale and the processes to ensure operational excellence and continued innovation in how we deliver services to our customers and clients. 
Before closing, I would like to note the retirement from our board of Chad Holliday. Chad joined our board in 2009 and became chairman in 2010. He guided the board during a transformation of our company. I thank him for his service and dedication to our company. 
On behalf of my more than 220,000 teammates here at Bank of America, thank you for your investment in our company. I look forward to reporting our progress to you throughout the year. 
"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2015,"To our 
shareholders, 
Thank you for investing in
Bank of America. In 2015, your company earned nearly $16 billion and returned nearly $4.5 billion
in capital. This progress is the result of continued strong business performance, no longer clouded over by heavy mortgage and crisis-related litigation and operating costs. 
Over the past several years, we’ve followed a strategy to simplify the company, rebuild our capital and liquidity, invest in our company 
and our capabilities, and pursue a straightforward model focused on responsible growth. 
At the Core of our strategy is the commitment we made to a clear purpose: to make financial lives better by connecting those we serve to the resources and expertise they need to achieve their goals. 
This is what drives us.
Before reviewing our progress, I want to highlight a couple of important points. Our Board of Directors regularly reviews our strategy, the environment in which we are operating, and the progress we are making toward the goals we set. Our Lead Independent Director, Jack Bovender, discusses this in his letter to shareholders on the previous page and in our 2016 proxy statement. You may also read more about our company in our Business Standards Report, which discusses in further detail how we live our purpose and the approach we take to fulfilling our responsibilities in the areas of environmental, social and governance (ESG). 
In 2015, your investment in the company, measured by tangible book value per share, was at a record $15.62. That figure has increased in each of the past five years and is up 21 percent in that period — and that is after nearly $12 billion of stock repurchases and dividends paid. 
Our return on assets (ROA) was 0.74 percent. Our longer-term target is 1.00 percent. The gap shows we still have work to do. However, our target is realistic, driven by continued loan growth and good core expense management. Expenses, excluding the large drop in litigation, were down nearly $3 billion last year, and we expect expenses to decline again in 2016. 
In December, we saw the first increase in short-term interest rates in nearly a decade. And, while interest rates are still a long way from normal, this move reflects a steadily improving U.S. economy, which has continued into early 2016. We see consumers spending and businesses growing, and it’s our job to help them. We will continue to drive the core business growth, even in a below-trend economic environment in the U.S. and around the world. 
The $16 billion we earned in 2015 reflected progress across
a range of measures: loan growth, business activity, capital, liquidity, credit improvement and cost management. Here are 
just a few examples of how our team supported customers and clients. Your company: 
•	Grew core loan balances by $75 billion and deposit balances by $78 billion. 
•	Issued nearly 5 million new credit cards, and saw consumer spending on credit cards rise 4 percent. 
•	Funded $70 billion in residential home loans, helping more than 260,000 families buy or refinance a home. 
•	Extended more than $10.7 billion in new credit to small business owners. 
•	Increased loans to the midsize companies we serve by 8 percent to $58 billion. 
•	Raised $718 billion of capital to help companies grow. 
None of these accomplishments would have been possible without a strong financial foundation. We ended 2015 with record liquidity of more than half-a-trillion dollars. What does that mean? In a time of financial stress, we could fund our company for more than three years without tapping the markets. 
We also have strong capital. At the end of 2015, our common equity tier 1 ratio, on a Basel 3 fully phased-in basis, was 9.8 percent, meaning we are well on our way to meeting the 
10 percent requirement that goes into effect in 2019. Part
of that requirement is a buffer, enacted this year, that is equivalent to holding $47 billion of our $162 billion in capital to ensure we make it through any downturn. That is a strong insurance policy. 
In the meantime, we continue to improve the qualitative and quantitative measures the Federal Reserve evaluates during its annual stress test, which determines the pace at which we can continue increasing the return of capital to shareholders. 
Another focus has been on managing expenses, which were down $18 billion in 2015, mostly due to lower litigation costs and lower operating costs in Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS). Even excluding those items, our core expenses keep coming down due to our efficiency efforts. 
At the same time, we have been steadily investing in technology, expanding our sales force and making other infrastructure improvements that are helping us better serve our clients and grow our business. 
Responsible Growth 
When we look at where we stand today, our company is stronger, simpler, and better positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, thanks to the straightforward way in which we serve our customers and clients. The path forward is clearly one of responsible growth. 
Responsible growth has four pillars: 
•	We must grow and win in the market — no excuses. 
•	We must grow with our customer-focused strategy. We aren’t going to grow by buying assets where we do not have an underlying relationship with the customer, such as mortgages originated by another company. Our growth will come through knowing our customers and clients, and being able to do more for them. 
•	We must grow within our Risk Framework. This is the foundation of everything we do. 
•	We must grow in a sustainable manner. This means having
the right business model, which sustains investments in growth and innovation while producing good, consistent returns. Sustainable also means having rigorous governance practices, and making decisions that are right for the customer, strengthen the brand and treat our employees well. 
We must grow and win in the market 
As we’ve discussed before, we serve three groups of customers— people, companies and institutional investors. In the U.S., we serve all three customer groups, and outside the U.S., we serve larger companies and institutional investors. This approach has helped simplify our operations and reduce our risk profile. 
Our 2015 results demonstrate that we grew across all our businesses. 
For the people we serve, this is the best consumer and wealth management franchise in the country. We serve 47 million households, and every week, we interact with customers more than 130 million times. In the time it takes you to read this letter, we will have had more than 100,000 contacts with customers. Your company is: 
•	A highly efficient deposit-gathering franchise with the largest retail deposit share in the U.S. 
•	No. 1 in home equity lending. 
•	No. 1 in investment asset growth with Merrill Edge. 
•	No. 1 in digital sales functionality, and we have the No. 1 online and mobile banking platform. 
Within the Consumer Banking and Wealth Management businesses, deposits grew by $64 billion, or 8 percent, from 2014. That is up more than $100 billion since the end of 2012, and that deposit growth alone is equal to a midsized U.S.-bank. 
We’ve introduced more ways that customers can interact with us and made it more convenient for them. We have more than 31 million digital customers, and mobile banking continues to grow with more than 19 million users. 
Why do we drive these capabilities? Why do we continue to invest in digital banking? Why are we tripling our investment in 2016? It is simply because this is how customers want to do business with us. Our customers deposit 250,000 checks a day through their mobile devices, reflecting 15 percent of consumer deposit transactions. We would need an additional 650 financial centers to handle the deposit activity that is currently being done on those mobile devices. In addition, over $3.6 billion in payments are sent by our mobile 
banking customers each week, and $14.2 billion is sent via online banking. 
To assist customers face-to-face, we still have more than 35,000 teammates who handle our 6 million financial center visits a week. This includes a growing specialized sales force to help customers with more complex transactions. In the past year, we added more than 800 Financial Solutions Advisors, Mortgage Loan Officers and Small Business Bankers as we optimized our branch network for relationship-deepening opportunities. 
Our ability to meet our customers’ needs the way they want
is resulting in strong organic growth across every consumer business category — checking, credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, and deposits—and we are growing faster than the market. Even as we continue to reduce costs, customer satisfaction is increasing because we are doing business the way they want us to. 
Turning to wealth management, Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust are two of the best brands in the wealth management business, and have the No. 1 market position across assets, deposits and loans. As of year-end 2015, our clients had entrusted us with $2.4 trillion of their money to steward for them. For the year, our wealth management business had record loan levels, with loan growth of 9 percent, and significantly higher deposit levels. Our financial advisors continued to broaden and deepen client relationships, providing them strong investment advising capabilities along with full financial planning. 
Total client balance flows in Global Wealth and Investment Management were $75 billion for the year. These businesses continue to integrate the broad capabilities of our company to meet client needs, and we continued to invest here, increasing our number of financial advisors by 4 percent last year. 
For the companies we serve, our Global Banking business works with virtually every company in the S&P 500. In many products and geographies, Global Banking has greater market share than our consumer business, delivering solid and recurring profitability. 
In 2015, we had strong loan growth of 12 percent for our commercial and corporate clients, and strong deposit growth. We also raised $718 billion in capital for our clients last year. These loans and capital help fuel the real economy in the
U.S. and around the world, helping small, medium and large businesses grow, add jobs and help families prosper. 
Recognizing these businesses we serve are the engines of the economy, we bring the broadest array of solutions, both domestic and international, to our clients — capital raising, lending, cash management, trade financing, currency risk hedging, lending in local currencies, and more. This helps companies grow, improve cash flow, and invest for the future. 
We remain well-positioned for growth and continue to expand and invest in our teams to develop new clients and build new relationships. 
Finally, turning to the institutional investors our company serves, our Global Markets business is one of the most capable platforms in the world. This business provides capital to companies necessary for growth, and serves many of the world’s largest institutional investors who manage savings and investments through pension and retirement funds. Our presence and global reach in fixed income and equity products allow us to provide them access to investment opportunities. 
We offer these clients our expertise backed by your award- winning Global Research team, which has been ranked No. 1 in the world by Institutional Investor magazine for five consecutive years. 
With competitors exiting parts of this business and capital markets and trading revenue down industrywide, the question is posed: why have a markets business? We have it first and foremost because our clients need our help to raise capital. In addition, our investors need to find opportunities to put their capital to work. 
The key then is to have a sales and trading and capital markets business that focuses on those missions and avoids the proprietary activities that got the industry in trouble in the last crisis. We have reshaped this business to do that. It is balanced and its narrower scope of activities enables it to weather market volatility well. Having those capabilities inside of a large, well- capitalized, diverse company like ours also is safer for our clients. 
And, because of our relative position in the business, serving clients in the largest fee pools in the world, we are able to operate the business quite profitably. In all of 2015, there were only four days when our trading business was not profitable. The fact remains there are only a handful of banks around the world that can handle the global needs of corporate clients, and your bank is one of those. 
So, this business is key to our customers, its risk has been reduced, and it makes money in almost all circumstances, helping our clients raise funds to grow and prosper. And our investor clients make money for their investors, the savers
of America, by showing them the trends in the markets and providing access to the companies that are issuing debt or equity. This relationship between companies and investors that we help create is key to making American and global capitalism work and growing the real economy. 
As we look across our businesses and the clients they serve, we have a leading set of capabilities in every area where we operate. That is the power of your company; that is the strength of the model and the balance we are striking to ensure we are doing all we can for our customers and clients, while optimizing our balance sheet to perform efficiently with the post-crisis regulations we must follow. 
We must grow with our customer-focused strategy 
We have a simple goal. We need to do more with our customers by bringing them everything they need to live their financial lives. I am often asked, “Why don’t you just go out and buy loans and grow faster?” We won’t do that because we want to save our balance sheet, as strong and big as it is, to serve our customers and clients, the relationships we work so hard to develop. In addition, one of the lessons we learned during the 
crisis was that a substantial portion of our legacy issues came from loans we acquired that were originated elsewhere. 
One of the ways we drive our customer-focused strategy is through our business integration work. Several years ago, we embraced a local market-driven approach. We organized the country into roughly 90 market coverage areas. At the local market level, our teams are working together to look at every customer and client relationship in their market and ask — are we doing all we can for them? 
We have seen dramatic growth in the way we are referring existing clients to other teammates who may not yet have
a relationship with those particular clients. From nearly 300,000 referrals five years ago to roughly 5 million in 2015, we believe this is a competitive differentiator, and we are driving it. 
This approach not only gets us the referrals and the business, but also creates a unique brand. It creates a global company that feels local. 
Last fall, after a visit to meet with customers and my teammates in Portland, Maine, I received a note from a client that to me was one of the highest compliments our firm could receive. He shared how, over the last year or so, he had seen 
“big” feeling “small” starting to happen. “Somehow, Bank of America feels like a small bank, albeit with incredible solutions for business clients.” 
We must grow within our Risk Framework 
As a financial services company, our business is to take risk in a responsible manner that serves our clients and helps the economy grow. 
Whether investing in a small business, making a credit decision, or preventing fraud, nearly every aspect of our work calls for sound judgment and a commitment to doing what’s right
for our customers and shareholders. Our culture emphasizes that we are one team, and we have a shared responsibility to manage risk, act responsibly, have an ownership mindset, and escalate issues so they can be addressed proactively. 
Over the past several years, we’ve reduced risk significantly — whether trading, operating or credit risk. For example, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and delinquencies all improved again in 2015. Charge-offs were the lowest they have been in a decade. What’s important here is how we did it — by focusing our efforts on core, creditworthy customers. 
This is at the heart of our approach to responsible growth: to understand our customers and clients well and do more with them at lower risk. 
Our Risk Framework is crucial to our ability to manage risk, run our business and grow responsibly. The Risk Framework is not a concept; it is a deep set of metrics against which we measure our teams to ensure that we maintain strong risk management discipline. 
We have invested heavily to improve our risk management practices, and we are committed to having best-in-class risk management capabilities, because we know that managing risk well is foundational to everything else we do. 
We must grow in a sustainable manner 
Building a sustainable company is about how, at the core of everything we do, we are guided by our principles to make the right decisions that will hold us in good stead today and in the future. We think about this in a variety of ways. 
First, it’s important to maintain focus on operational excellence, and on the momentum we’ve built managing expenses. We have made significant improvement in decreasing our operating expenses. If you strip out expenses for litigation and LAS, which alone are down nearly $11 billion over the past four years, expenses for 2015 decreased more than $12 billion since 2011, and we expect them to fall again this year. This progress is enabled by the investments we make in efficiency. 
For example, over the last five years we have reduced our real estate footprint by 34 percent, or 44 million square feet.To put that in context, the Empire State Building is roughly 3 million square feet. We’ve also reduced our financial centers by nearly 
1,000 as we’ve optimized our footprint. One example on the technology front is the work we have done to reduce the number of server models we use. We started with nearly 500 different models and are reducing that down. When this and other technology infrastructure efficiency efforts are completed in 2019, we will save more than $500 million in annual costs.
We continue to identify and pursue this type of simplification and efficiency, every day throughout the company. 
Importantly, we have done all this work while investing in growth initiatives and increasing our sales force. We spend $3 billion each year on developing new technology initiatives. This is not to run the platform; this is all new development. 
Sustainability is also about trust. As a company, we are rebuilding trust that was impacted during the financial crisis. 
That comes down to everything from how we do business, to how we govern our company, to how we invest in our communities, and to how we treat our employees. We made progress in all these areas in the past year. 
In terms of how we govern the company, we have a diverse and experienced Board of Directors that provides independent oversight. Our Board constantly looks for ways to ensure its diversity and strength, and monitors corporate governance best practices to adapt and improve when necessary. 
In fulfilling the Board’s oversight responsibilities, our independent directors appointed a Lead Independent Director with responsibilities that exceed what governance experts 
have identified as the best practices for that position. You can review the proxy for more information about Board governance. 
Another way we think about sustainability is the work we do to strengthen our local economies, invest in our communities and be a great place to work for our employees. 
In 2015, this included increasing our environmental business initiative to $125 billion — one of the largest commitments to finance new energy — through lending, investing, capital raising and developing financial solutions for clients. 
Our company continues to support the U.S. military through home donations, job skills training and hiring. Last year, we hired more than 2,000 veterans as part of our commitment to hire 10,000 veterans. And, in a tribute to their service, of the 5,700 homes we have donated, nearly 2,000 were donated to help returning veterans and their families. What makes this special is the volunteer work our teammates put in to cleaning up and getting the homes ready for the new families. 
To support our communities, we also invested more than $180 million in philanthropic investments, and our employees donated nearly 2 million hours of volunteer service to the causes they care about around the world. 
Sustainability gives us the opportunity to apply the size and scale we have to do big things, and as a global company, we have a role in finding sustainable solutions to some of society’s biggest challenges. 
One example is the work our team has done with (RED)TM to help end mother-to-child transmission of AIDS in Africa. We partnered with (RED) because we saw an opportunity to use our size and scale to tackle the challenge. And, we’ve been able to do so by giving our employees and customers an opportunity to get involved, which is something they tell us is important 
to them. 
Finally, and most importantly, being a sustainable company means we value our people and give all employees the support they need to build a career, achieve their goals, and have the resources they need to improve their lives and the lives of their families. All that we are and all that we achieve is because of our employees, and I want to thank them for all they do. 
We have a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflects
the diversity of the customers, clients and communities we serve in more than 35 countries around the world. To help employees develop in their careers, we provide resources and strategies, no matter where they are in their career. Through our recruitment programs and partnerships, we are investing in the future by bringing the best and brightest to work at Bank of America. Our campus recruiting has increased over the last 
several years, and last year’s recruiting class was more than 50 percent diverse. 
We’ve also made changes to our benefits, increasing our wellness offerings and other family support programs to reflect the needs of our workforce. 
As we think about all the ways we pursue sustainability, our size and scale give us tremendous resources to bring to a task — whether supporting the economy, partnering in the fight against AIDS, protecting the financial infrastructure, or building a great place to work. Our focus is to use our size and scale in ways that contribute positively to our communities, create opportunity for our customers and grow our company responsibly. 
Conclusion 
As we take stock of where Bank of America stands today, we can see the tangible results of hard work as we’ve simplified, strengthened and transformed our company. We have a strong foundation, we have a strategy focused on the customers we serve, and all the capabilities we possess have come together as an engine for responsible growth that is producing stronger financial results and momentum. 
All of this is made possible by more than 200,000 teammates who come to work every day to serve clients and improve our communities. Together, we will continue to take the company forward and deliver more value to those we serve and to our shareholders. 
Thank you for your continued investment in Bank of America. 

"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2016,"Our strong performance allowed us to return
$6.6 billion in capital to shareholders through a higher dividend, and by repurchasing common shares. The latter helped offset significant shareholder dilution that occurred during the financial crisis, which I discuss in more detail below. These results reflect years of work to simplify the company, rebuild and strengthen the balance sheet, and focus on serving our core customers. 
In a dynamic operating environment characterized by unexpected events around the world, we saw the benefits of remaining nimble, adapting to change
in the near term, while adhering to our long-term strategy to support our customers and clients and deliver for our shareholders. 
Through our responsible growth strategy, we
grew revenue, reduced expenses, managed risks
and continued to invest in our workforce and our capabilities. We also made steady progress relative to our long-term financial goals (return on tangible common equity of 12 percent and a return on assets of 1 percent). Our return on tangible common equity increased to 9.5 percent, while our return on assets improved to 0.82 percent. The efficiency ratio improved from 70 percent to 66 percent. Tangible book value per share, which measures the value we are creating for you, increased 9 percent in 2016
to $16.95. In 2017, we will continue to drive this company further toward our goals. 
We drove these results in part through operational excellence, working hard to manage expenses and reinvest in our capabilities. We reduced expenses by $3 billion last year, and while we have more work to do, expenses are down $22 billion, or nearly 
30 percent, from their peak of $77 billion in 2011. 
It’s important to note that we did this while growing the business. This created the operating leverage we need to invest for the future. We also accomplished this in a slow-growth U.S. and global economy. 
However, as U.S. interest rates begin to rise, I am encouraged by what this signifies: an improving
U.S. economy marked by low unemployment and increasing consumer and business confidence. It’s our job to nurture this growth and help drive the real economy in the U.S. and around the world. 
Committed to Capital Returns 
I want to focus on what our results mean for long- term shareholder value, but a little background
is necessary. In 2006, we earned the most in our history ($21 billion). We had 4.6 billion shares outstanding, meaning our diluted earnings per share was $4.58. We also paid a common stock dividend of $2.12 per share, or 46 percent of our earnings. Now, compare this to our 2016 results: earnings were $18 billion, but because we had more than twice as many shares outstanding, our EPS was $1.50 per diluted share, and our common stock dividend was $0.25 per share, or 17 percent of earnings. 
The biggest difference between the two periods
is the increase in common shares and a reduction in the dividend. Both were necessary to stabilize the company after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and now that our company is stronger, we are focused on reducing the dilution and increasing the dividend. 
Our shares outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, peaked at 11.6 billion. We issued more than
7 billion common shares during the crisis. We funded acquisitions, strengthened our balance sheet to meet higher capital requirements, and repaid the government’s TARP investment within 13 months. We are working the share count down; at year end, we were at 11 billion shares. The market value of our company remains strong. As I write this letter, our market capitalization on a fully diluted basis is at an all-time high of more than $280 billion. 
We are also focused on increasing the dividend. Last June, we increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 50 percent, made possible by all the work we’ve done to simplify the company, strengthen the balance sheet and rebuild capital. 
What are the lessons we learned from this? 
First, we must grow organically. Acquisitions are not part of our strategy so we don’t have to issue shares. 
Second, our businesses generate more than sufficient capital to fund their growth. We have shed non-core businesses and we have everything we need to serve our clients, so we can focus on building stronger relationships with them and optimizing returns. 
Third, we need to continue to reduce the number of shares outstanding. This is essential if we want our stock price to exceed the record highs we have achieved in our market capitalization and in our tangible book value per share. And, because our stock is trading at a price that is close to our book value, repurchasing shares now creates long-term value for remaining shareholders when we buy from the selling shareholders at this level. 
Finally, by staying focused on these things, and executing our strategy of responsible growth, we can deliver the returns that you expect from us and continue to return excess capital to you through dividends and common stock repurchases. 
Responsible Growth Is Working 
We will remain on the path that led us to near-record earnings in 2016. Responsible growth means remaining steadfast in delivering on our purpose to help our customers and clients live their financial lives by connecting them to all of our capabilities. 
This strategy has four tenets:
• Grow and win in the market, no excuses.
• Grow with our customer-focused strategy. • Grow within our Risk Framework.
• Grow in a sustainable manner. 
To put it more simply: Not every dollar is a good dollar, unless it comes from activities that satisfy a customer need and fit our risk parameters. We are here to serve our customers and clients and to nurture those relationships and drive growth with the leading capabilities we have across our company. Ours is a relationship business, and in this report, you will read about the relationships 
4 
we’ve built with several client companies and how we’ve helped them achieve their financial goals. 
Advancing the Goals of People, Companies, and Institutional Investors 
I’ll begin with the people we serve. We serve 46 million households, and every week, we interact with customers more than 130 million times. In the time it takes you to read this letter, we will have had more than 100,000 contacts with customers. 
Last year, our Consumer and Wealth Management segments grew deposits by $57 billion, or 7 percent, and increased loans by $29 billion, or 8 percent. We originated $79 billion in residential mortgages, up 13 percent, helping more than 260,000 families buy or refinance a home. 
We continue to see strong enrollment in our preferred rewards program, up more than 40 percent from 2015, and we’re seeing
a 99 percent retention rate in this program. We have more than 33 million online customers, and nearly 22 million mobile banking users. You can learn more about how we are redefining the 
retail financial services experience in the comments from Dean Athanasia and Thong Nguyen, the co-heads of our Consumer Banking business, on pages 10–11. 
In Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust, we have two of the best brands in the wealth management business, as well as the No. 1 market position across assets, deposits and loans. As Merrill Lynch Private Wealth Advisor Raj Sharma explains on page 10, these businesses continue to integrate the broad capabilities of our company to meet client needs. 
Turning to the companies we serve, our Global Banking business works with virtually every one of the S&P 500 firms. In addition to a range of lending and other solutions, we have one of the world’s top-tier investment banks, ranked No. 3 globally in investment banking fees last year. We also are one of the largest lenders to mid-sized companies and to small businesses. As you will see from the stories of our great clients Cisco, WeWork, and Yoobi
in this report, we bring the broadest array of capabilities to our clients—cash management, trade financing, lending in local currencies, and more—to support businesses that are driving the real economy here in the U.S. and around the world. 
Finally, through our Global Markets business, we serve many of the world’s largest institutional investors, who are managing savings and investments through pension and retirement funds. This is a balanced business, narrower in its scope of activities than before the financial crisis, and focused on clients needing to raise capital and investors seeking the best opportunities to put their capital to work. 
Because of our balanced approach, Global Markets can weather market volatility and make money in a wide range of economic scenarios. Our sales and trading business was profitable on
all but three days last year, despite the volatility caused by macroeconomic events, including the United Kingdom vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. elections. 
A differentiator for us is our Global Research team. For the
sixth year in a row, our team was ranked No. 1 in the world by Institutional Investor magazine. Our research capabilities help drive our entire company, providing valuable insights to our markets business, corporate banking, and our wealth management clients. 
Managing Risk Well Is Central to Everything We Do 
In addition to keeping a clear focus on customers and clients,
our responsible growth strategy includes growing within a clear Risk Framework so that we can maintain our balanced, stable and financially strong platform. This means understanding the risk and reward in everything we do and empowering our teammates to share their opinions and ideas so we make better decisions. 
In the last quarter of 2016, we had the lowest charge-off ratio in our company’s history. For all of 2016, we grew core loan balances by 6 percent, yet charge-offs declined by 12 percent, which demonstrates our focus on growing the right way. In this report, Chief Risk Officer Geoff Greener discusses how we continue to strengthen our risk management so that every employee understands his or her role. 
Ensuring Our Growth Is Sustainable 
The final tenet of responsible growth is that we must grow
in a sustainable manner. That means we must adhere to rigorous standards of corporate governance; we must invest in our communities; and we must strive to be the best place to work by helping our 200,000 teammates achieve their goals and aspirations. 
Our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices are cen- tral to growing in a sustainable manner. A special ESG supplement enclosed in our Annual Report mailing this year provides additional details. There is also an extended discussion of our ESG practices in the proxy statement. Let me highlight a few key elements. 
We are committed to best practices in corporate governance, including a strong, independent Board of Directors and other measures. The Board oversees our responsible growth strategy to deliver long-term value for you, our shareholders. Also, the Board has empowered a lead independent director whose duties and responsibilities meet or exceed corporate best practices. You can learn more about how the Board discharges its responsibilities in the Q&A with Lead Independent Director Jack Bovender in this report, and in the 2017 proxy statement. We also view the nearly $200 million in philanthropic investments we make in communi- ties around the world, and the nearly 2 million volunteer hours our teammates commit to the causes they care about, as critical to creating the conditions for long-term, sustainable growth. 
Also critical to fostering sustainable growth is the way we invest in our workforce and create an environment where they can thrive. As of early 2017, we’ve increased our minimum wage so that all employ- ees earn more than $15 an hour. We will continue to adjust that, as we have regularly for several years now. In 2016, we also increased our fully paid parental leave from 12 to 16 weeks for all new parents. We create sustainable results through our Simplify and Improve (SIM) program, as well. Driven by thousands of ideas generated by our own teammates, SIM is our ongoing process of simplifying our 
company, eliminating or streamlining our internal and external pro- cesses, and reducing costs so we can reinvest in future growth. 
It’s the hard work of our team that makes everything we are sharing with you on these pages possible. And, it’s our duty to create an environment that reflects and honors the diversity they represent, promotes inclusiveness and the sharing of different viewpoints, and provides benefits and career development opportunities so they can continue to grow and thrive. 
Helping to Drive the Economy 
To continue the strong performance we saw in 2016, we remain focused on executing our responsible growth strategy. There
will be external impacts from changes in the markets, driven by political and economic factors that we cannot predict. We may see changes to banking laws, or to how regulations are implemented, in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate. Reasonable regulation is important for the safety and soundness of our financial system, and we support a review by policymakers and elected officials to ensure they strike the right balance to drive responsible economic growth. 
As always, we must be agile and adaptive, but what will not change are the principles upon which we run our company. In both the near term and for the long term, given the current regulatory environment and because of the way we rebuilt our balance sheet and how we are executing our responsible growth strategy, we 
will have excess capital to put to work driving the economy. We are lending, and we will continue returning capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. There is a discussion
in some quarters about perceived trade-offs between those important objectives, but we can do both while growing the company. We will continue investing in our business, our people, and our communities because we understand that when our customers, communities and employees succeed, we all succeed. 
Thank you for investing in Bank of America. 
"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2017,"Dear shareholders, 
We have committed to you that Bank of America will stay true to our course of responsible growth, and our 2017 financial results reflect that in every dimension. We grew revenue by 4 percent to $87 billion, and we increased earnings per share (EPS) by 5 percent to $1.56. Adjusting for the one-time charge from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), revenue was up 5 percent to $88 billion, EPS increased 23 percent to $1.83. 
I will discuss in further detail below the overall impact of the Tax Act and how we view the anticipated long-term benefits. 
Responsible growth also delivered for you, our shareholders. In 2017, we returned $15.9 billion in capital through common dividends and net share repurchases—nearly 90 percent of net income—up from $6.6 billion in 2016. Total shareholder return was 35.7 percent for 2017 and, as you can see in the chart on page 32, we outperformed major benchmarks. Our market valuation continues to grow, increasing by $82 billion in 2017 and standing near $330 billion as I write this. 
Our financial metrics also improved. Adjusted for the impact of the tax legislation mentioned earlier, return on tangible common equity grew 150 basis points to 11 percent, well above our estimated cost of capital of 9 percent, and our return on assets rose 12 basis points to 0.93 percent. Our efficiency ratio further improved to 63 percent. Tangible book value per share, which measures the value we are creating for you, hit $16.96 at the end of 2017. In 2018, we expect continued improvement on all of these metrics. 
I am proud of the countless ways our 209,000 teammates delivered in 2017, but what I want to emphasize for you is that we grew the right way—we drove responsible growth. We stuck with our approach and didn’t reach beyond our customer and risk frameworks for short-term 
gains. And we continued to invest in our teammates, our communities, and improving our company through operational excellence, so our growth would be sustainable. 
WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO RETURNING CAPITAL 
Before I highlight the results from our customer and client businesses, I want to touch on a point
I discussed in some detail in last year’s letter. As I outlined last year, the number of shares outstand- ing, on a fully diluted basis, peaked at 11.6 billion, driven by the more than 7 billion common shares we issued for acquisitions and shares we issued to stabilize the company during the Great Recession. 
We will continue to bring the share count down as we focus on returning excess capital to you. At the end of 2017, we reduced our fully diluted 
shares to 10.5 billion shares—a decline of more than 1 billion shares from the peak. Continuing on that path is a priority for us, and we plan to proceed with share buybacks and dividend increases based on our continued progress as measured through the annual Federal Reserve Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. 
Returning capital to shareholders does not prevent us from making loans as some suggest. We simply have more capital than we need to meet today’s requirements, and we can grow without using more for the foreseeable future. We have plenty
of capital to serve our customers and clients’ needs. 
DRIVING ECONOMIC GROWTH BY SERVING CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS 
Now, I’d like to highlight how we delivered for our three groups of customers: people, companies, and institutional investors. 
In 2017, our Consumer Banking business, which serves one in two U.S. households and millions of small business clients, earned $8.2 billion in after-tax net income on revenue of $35 billion, up 14 percent and 9 percent, respectively, from the prior year. Our growth was broad-based; deposits grew by $54 billion, or 9 percent, to $653 billion, and we grew loans by $20 billion, or 8 percent, to $266 billion. And, even though rising interest rates tempered demand for mortgage refinancing, we originated $68 billion in mortgages in 2017. 
After years of investment, Bank of America is the digital banking leader, with 35 million digital customers, including 25 million active mobile banking users. In 2017, our mobile banking app became the first to be certified by J.D. Power. Importantly, these customers logged in to our mobile app more than 1.3 billion times in 2017. 
We process millions of transactions daily for our customers and clients. One area of significant growth is person-to-person (P2P) payments. We are a leader in payments via Zelle. While some 60 financial institutions are in the Zelle network, a third of all trans- actions in 2017 were conducted by Bank of America customers. Our P2P transactions more than doubled in 2017. The Zelle capability is integrated into Bank of America’s mobile app and allows our customers to make payments easily and securely, and even split payments to different recipients. The rapid adoption of Zelle enhances the customer experience and also helps us reduce the costs and risks associated with paper checks and cash transactions. 
Let me take a moment to explain why digital technology is so important to our future. 
For years, we have focused on redefining retail banking and improving the customer experience, both in our financial centers and through our digital platforms. We call this approach “high-touch, high-tech,” because it describes how we are following customer behavior to combine improvements in our 4,500 financial centers and new digital capabilities to enhance the overall customer experience however customers choose to engage with us. In addition to advances in our digital and mobile capabilities, which have resulted in digital sales comprising 30 percent of total sales, we are investing to refresh those centers and ATMs, and we are opening new financial centers in areas where we are serving customers and clients but have no retail presence, or too few centers. 
In the map on page 5, you can see the markets where we have begun adding financial centers, and where we will be doing so in the near future. Last year, we also added
more than 800 small business bankers, mortgage specialists, financial advisors, and other experts in our financial centers. Even with these investments, and with customer satisfaction levels at or near all-time highs, the efficiency ratio in our Consumer busi- ness—which measures what it costs to generate a dollar in revenue—improved by more than 4 percentage points in 2017 to 52 percent. 
Turning to our Global Wealth and Investment Management business, we serve afflu- ent and wealthy investor clients through the two leading brands in wealth management: Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust. This business delivered $3 billion in after-tax net income
on $19 billion in revenue in 2017, generating a 27 percent pretax margin. These results reflect years of investment and attention to serving the needs of our clients. 
In 2017, we saw assets under management (AUM) flows of nearly $100 billion as clients continued to trust us to manage their investments. It’s also worth noting that, in the fourth quarter of 2017, loans to clients in this business grew by $11 billion, or 7 percent, over the fourth quarter of 2016, marking the 31st consecutive quarter of loan growth. The value of the integrated capabilities we offer our clients continues to deliver returns for our shareholders. By enhancing the client experience, and bringing to bear all that our enterprise has to offer to help clients achieve their goals, we’re deepening relation- ships and gaining new ones. 
Our Global Banking business serves clients from medium-sized businesses to the largest companies in the world. Global Banking set several records in 2017, including revenue of $20 billion and after-tax net income of $7 billion. Full-year earnings were up 21 percent on strong operating leverage, as revenue rose 8 percent, while expenses rose only 1 percent. That is the kind of operating leverage our operational excellence can deliver. 
We are investing in this business as well, including technology to improve the client experience and hiring additional bankers. Over the past few years, we have added more than 400 bankers to our Global Banking team in markets across the United States as we continued to deepen local relationships with our commercial clients. This investment paid off for us in many ways in 2017. For example, overall investment banking fees rose 15 percent in 2017 to $6 billion. We were gratified to see a 30 percent growth in fees from middle-market investment banking. 
Global Markets serves our corporate clients and the largest institutional investors in the world. We saw solid, stable performance despite a challenging low volatility trading environment. This business generated $16 billion in revenue and $3.3 billion in after-tax net income. 
Let me share a few observations about how we operate this business. We serve clients around the world who want to raise capital and hedge risks. When markets are volatile and clients are trying to manage their business, they turn to us for help. When markets are stable and there is less client activity or volatility, our revenues may be lower, as we saw in 2017. 
We have positioned this business to deliver steady and sustainable returns in either sce- nario, while taking less risk. Over the years, our performance bears that out. In 2017, total sales and trading revenue, excluding debit valuation adjustments, was $13.2 billion, down 3 percent from the prior year. However, across the past five years and with all of the vol- atility in markets and trading activities during that period, Global Markets has delivered sales and trading revenue within a range of $12.9 billion and $13.6 billion. This relative sta- bility reflects our leadership positions across multiple products and our ability to maintain the appropriate business mix during market shifts. Reflecting that stability and solid risk management, Global Markets made money every single trading day in 2017. Over the last five years, we made money in Global Markets on 98 percent of trading days. 
RESPONSIBLE GROWTH THAT IS SUSTAINABLE 
Looking at our 2017 business results, you can see that we remained true to our responsible growth strategy: We grew by focusing on serving our customers and clients and managing risk well. 
We also are focused on achieving growth that is sustainable. Sustainability has three key compo- nents: Being the best place to work for our team, sharing our success, and operational excellence. To share success, we focus on our environ- mental, social, and governance (ESG) activities; responsible corporate gov- ernance practices; our $125 billion environmental initiative; our philan- thropy; and many other activities. 
Our ESG work includes the many ways we share our success by driving growth in the communities we serve. In 2017, we provided $4.5 billion in loans, tax credit equity investments and other real estate development solutions through Community Development Banking. We financed affordable housing, charter schools, health care and economic devel- opment across the United States, including 12,000 affordable housing units, nearly 5,000 of which went 
to seniors, military veterans and the formerly homeless. We deployed capital in many other ways to strengthen our communities, including $200 million in philanthropic giving. Also, our teammates spent 2 million hours supporting and volunteering with local organizations
and chapters. It gives me great pride to see what the teams are doing in all our markets. 
You can read more about how we are supporting communities throughout this report, including the four-page feature, beginning on page 16. 
Sustainability has an element of opera- tional excellence, continuing to improve our company and reinvesting those savings into future capabilities. Through prior initiatives, including our “New BAC” work in 2011 and our ongoing Simplify and Improve (SIM) program, we have simplified our company and made it easier for our teammates to serve customers and clients. We have unlocked savings that we have invested back into the company to innovate and improve our capabilities; an example of this is the addition of specialists in 
our financial centers, and more commercial and corporate bankers to serve local markets, which I discussed earlier. 
As we have continued to invest in oper- ational excellence, we have reduced the amount we spend each year by $26 billion since 2011. In 2016, we set a target of approximately $53 billion in annualized expenses for 2018, which we have reached. At the same time, our customer satisfac- tion scores are at pre-crisis levels, and improving. 
INVESTING IN OUR TEAM TO BE A GREAT PLACE TO WORK 
Another component of being sustainable is our commitment to be a great place to work. In 2017, we demonstrated that commitment in several ways. 
At the beginning of 2017, we reached
the $15 per hour starting compensation level after years of regular increases for U.S. teammates. I’m pleased to see that other companies have followed suit more recently, influenced by the passage of the 
Tax Act in the United States. We will continue to review and adjust our start- ing wage as part of our commitment to fair and equitable compensation for all of our teammates. 
Please look for additional discussion in this report from Sheri Bronstein, Global Human Resources executive, about our compensation and benefits, including career development and learning, and other initiatives to help our teammates see Bank of America as a great place to work. Sheri’s note also describes our industry-leading work on health care and wellness for our team. 
SHARING THE BENEFITS OF U.S. TAX REFORM 
Earlier, I mentioned that there was a one-time charge to our 2017 earnings from the Tax Act. However, there are many benefits from tax reform that I want to discuss. These benefits impact how we will invest in the future and deliver returns to you. 
The backdrop for this discussion is the solid economic growth our experts expect in 2018. As I write this letter, our economists expect about
2.7 percent growth in the U.S. economy, with the unemployment rate hovering at 4 percent or perhaps even lower. The driver continues to be the consumer, and so far in 2018, we see healthy consumer activity, with Bank of America credit and debit card spending up strongly so far this year. Our business clients are showing confidence in a more stable and predictable regulatory environment than in recent years. 
When I think about the impact of the Tax Act, it starts with the broader benefits to the U.S. economy. By lowering the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, and by creating a territorial tax system where corporate earnings are taxed at the rate of the jurisdiction in which they are earned, the Tax Act allows companies to make business decisions less dependent on the tax considerations necessitated by the prior imbalance in rates between the United States and the rest of the world. This levels the playing field for U.S. companies and impacts their decisions. 
In discussions with clients who are CEOs of companies headquartered abroad, I’ve been struck by a common theme. The United States is an attractive market for them, with solid consumer demand, highly skilled workers, stable rule of law, plentiful and predictable energy availability, and other factors. Even so, prior to the Tax Act reforms, these clients had no choice but to base investment decisions on the tax effects of different rates around the world. With the U.S. corporate rate better aligned with that of other countries, these CEOs now are considering how to invest in manufacturing and production in the U.S., where the final demand for their products remains so strong because the U.S. consumer economy is so healthy. 
We’re seeing other economic benefits from tax reform as well. Hundreds
of U.S. companies have provided bonuses, wage increases, and increased matches to retirement savings plans to millions of American workers. At Bank of America, more than 90 percent of employees have received a one- time payment as a direct result of U.S. tax reform, impacting about 180,000 teammates in the U.S. and overseas. In addition, we will continue to invest in our company in a balanced way that focuses on improving our connection with customers, while increasing our competitiveness and sustainability.
We are expanding our financial center presence, as I discussed earlier. We are investing in new technology and innovation across all our businesses. 
All these investments create jobs, too. We will look to these and other areas as we continue to grow and the benefits of tax reform play out. As these benefits are realized, it is also important that we retain our long-term focus on addressing the federal debt and ensuring the U.S. remains a fiscally strong, competitive global leader. 
COMMITTED TO STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Let me conclude by discussing how the man- agement team and the Board of Directors work together to advance your investment
in Bank of America. Effective corporate gov- ernance is a tenet for sustaining responsible growth. You are represented by a strong independent Board. Our Lead Independent Director, Jack Bovender, and the other directors meet regularly with management, regulators, and shareholders to review how we are implementing responsible growth and executing our strategy of serving three groups of clients with our integrated financial services capabilities. 
Throughout the year, the Board meets with management to oversee risk management and governance, and carry out other important duties directly and through Board commit- tees that have strong, experienced chairs and members. In addition, the management team and the Board meet to review in detail ongoing results and issues needing deeper discussion. The Board and committees also give regular input to us about topics of interest which require additional conversation. In late fall, we hold an extended session over several days to review the three-year strategic plan and make adjustments based on the operating environ- ment, markets, and other opportunities. See Jack’s note for his discussion about the Board’s role in strategic planning. 
We are proud of the work our directors have done to increase diversity on our Board; we are one of only five companies in the S&P 100 to have five or more female board members. Our director recruiting process focuses on diversity of talent and perspective to ensure invigorating discourse among Board members and management. In 2017, we were pleased that Dr. Maria Zuber, the vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joined our Board. Dr. Zuber brings diverse 
perspectives in several areas, including technology and risk management. In the short time she has been with us, we have already benefited from her unique talents and experience. 
I encourage you to read more about our corporate governance activities in our 2018 Proxy Statement. 
LIVING OUR PURPOSE 
In 2017, we saw responsible growth at work for shareholders, customers and clients, the commu- nities we serve, and our teammates. We discuss this in greater detail in the following pages, where you’ll see many examples of how we are living our purpose: to help make financial lives better through the power of every connection. 
Thank you for your support and your investment in Bank of America. I look forward to another strong year for our company. 
"
Bank of America,BAC,Financials,2018,"Dear shareholders, 
I am pleased to report to you that by adhering to Responsible Growth, the 200,000-strong team at Bank of America produced record earnings in 2018 of $28.1 billion, or $2.61 per share. We did this by living our purpose, which is to
help make our clients’ financial lives better through the power of every connection we can make — both for them and with them. Even as we continue to provide capital to our customers and clients, invest heavily in our company, and deploy capital to address some of the world’s toughest priorities, we were able to return nearly $26 billion in capital to our shareholders, including more than $5 billion in dividends and more than $20 billion in share repurchases. We continue to make progress to undo the dilution from the shares we issued due to the economic crisis of 2008-2009 and subsequent regulatory changes. Our capital, liquidity and capa- city to serve clients are at record levels, and we have reduced the total number of fully diluted shares outstanding to below 10 billion. Over a three-year period, total shareholder return increased by more than 50 percent, outpacing the S&P 500 
and exceeding the average of our U.S. large cap peers by more than three times. 
Our culture of careful expense management has resulted
in a $30 billion reduction in our expense base since 2010. We achieved this even as we generated greater customer activity and revenue, addressed industrywide inflation
and cost challenges, and invested consistently. Positive oper- ating leverage—meaning the change in revenue outpacing the change in expenses—has resulted in an efficiency ratio of 58.5 percent for 2018, transforming Bank of America 
into one of the most efficient firms in our industry. 
Backdrop for 2019 
The U.S. economy remains resilient and is growing. We are proud of our Bank of America Research team, which has been ranked as the best in the world for six of the last eight years. As I write this letter in late February 2019, those experts see the U.S. GDP growing 2.2 percent this year, and the world economy growing 3.4 percent. The U.S. consumer is solid: We observed 9 percent growth in 2018 over 2017 in our U.S. customer spending and money movement through Bank of America channels. Business and consumer confidence also remain solid. We see good opportunities ahead as we deepen our relationships, and add new ones, in each of our businesses. 
Driving Responsible Growth 
Our commitment to Responsible Growth is resolute. In previous letters, we have discussed this framework. Responsible Growth has four tenets: We have to grow—no excuses. We have to grow by delivering more for our customers and clients. We have to grow by managing risk well. And, our growth must be sustainable. Sustainable means 
we have to share our success with our communities, we have to be a great place to work for our teammates, and we have to drive operational excellence. This creates the ability to reinvest the savings back into our team, our capabilities, our client experience, and our communities and shareholders. 
I’ll review our company’s performance in 2018 by discussing each of these tenets of Responsible Growth in more detail. By following them, we have kept credit costs at decade-lows and have driven positive operating leverage each consecu- tive quarter for four years running. For the year, we were 
the world’s third most valuable financial services company (as measured by market capitalization) and among the world’s top 10 most profitable companies. Our fourth-quarter 2018 earnings were the most among all U.S. global banks. 
External recognition 
Being one of the most profitable and efficient banks makes it possible for us to invest in award-winning capa- bilities, people and products to serve our customers and clients well. In 2018, we received top recognition as a company, including being named “World’s Best Bank” by Euromoney, an authoritative industry publication. We
also were recognized for our employment practices and commitment to being a great place to work, our customer service, our mobile and digital capabilities, and for other products and services in every major category. In February 2019, we were ranked as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” by Fortune magazine and the global research and consulting firm Great Place to Work®. Bank of America also was recognized as the only financial services company on Fortune’s inaugural “Best Big Companies to Work For” list, which comprises seven companies with more than 100,000 U.S.-based employees. 
What would you like the power to do? 
Listening to how customers, our employees and our share- holders answer the question “What would you like the power to do?” is how we learn what matters most to them. By asking, we start a conversation centered on our commitment to serve by bringing our capabilities to help clients be successful. 
We ask this question of our customers, in the communities we serve, and of our employees. Responsible Growth guides us in living our purpose to help make financial lives better, and to achieve strong operating results the right way. The three-year company strategy that our board of directors reviews and approves each fall is based on continuing to adhere to this approach. 
What are we asking our clients with our straightforward question? It’s your financial life; it’s your decision. We will bring capabilities that are second to none to help you be successful. 
We will connect our capabilities for clients as no other finan- cial services company can. Simply put: We are here to serve. 
In 2018, we refined our company’s brand and logo to better reflect our work and progress over many years. Over time, these will continue to evolve to better visualize the way we run our company today. We’ll continue to serve by deepening our relationships, helping each individual, each business and each investor through the power of every connection we can help them make. That is our purpose, and it is how we want everyone—employees, the communities we serve, clients and investors—to see us. 
Grow. No excuses. 
The first tenet of Responsible Growth is that we have to grow, no excuses. As you can see on page 4, each of our businesses grew, thereby contributing to our record earnings in 2018. 
Over the last four years, deposits have grown 4 percent
and loans across all our business segments have grown
6 percent on average. For 2018, deposit and loan growth within our business segments exceeded the net U.S. GDP rate. That is our core growth goal: to grow somewhat faster than the economy. Throughout 2018, our client base expanded and our market positions continued to improve in most of our businesses. 
Rising interest rates helped us deliver earnings growth, but we don’t depend on them. Our growth in client deposits funds our loan growth across all of our businesses and enables us to continue to grow net interest income, even if further interest rate rises fail to materialize. 
Our eight lines of business grew as a result of deepening client relationships and developing new relationships. 
Growing by focusing on the customer 
We are pleased to serve more than one in three U.S. house- holds and more than 9 million business-owner clients. Our 
Consumer Banking business held $684 billion in average deposits during 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 5 percent. Average loans in that business grew by 7 percent. We have grown consumer checking balances for 40 consec- utive quarters, producing an additional $200 billion in
core checking deposits in our consumer business alone.
In addition, average small business loans in Consumer Banking have grown 13 percent over the last three years. 
Through 2018, we also continued to see rapid growth in our digital and mobile channels due to decades of investment. In 2018, our customers registered nearly 6 billion consumer banking app logins, allowing us to maintain regular connec- tivity with them, and provide unparalleled convenience. We have nearly 37 million digital banking users; nearly 
27 million are active mobile banking customers. We now process more deposit transactions through mobile devices than in our financial centers. And 25 percent of our consumer sales, including credit cards and auto loans, were completed through a digital channel in 2018. 
While we are seeing digital and mobile growth, we are investing heavily in our facilities and in the teammates who serve there, as well. We have retooled many of our ATMs, our financial centers, and our technology in the branches and call centers. And we have invested in skills for our teammates to have more opportunity in our consumer businesses. 
These efforts have led to our strongest customer scores
in our history. Our ability to deepen customer and client rela- tionships is driven in part by the investments we are making to provide the best client care in the industry. For example, overall, our company was certified or recognized as having industry-leading capabilities six times by J.D. Power in 2018. Specifically, J.D. Power recognized our Digital Mortgage Experience and Home Loan Navigator for making the home- buying experience simpler than ever, and identified Bank
of America as a top performer in several areas. We are the first financial services company to be both mobile app- 
and online banking-certified by J.D. Power for providing “An Outstanding Customer Experience.” Our auto finance, digital, mobile and credit card banking capabilities all were recognized as best-in-class, as were our small business offerings. 
We saw similar growth in our Global Wealth and Investment Management business, where net new household growth was up four times from 2017, and overall client balances exceeded $2.6 trillion. We have added digital capabilities, more advisors and new products. 
Our Global Banking business continues to do a great job serving up to the largest multinational companies. We also are deepening relationships with those clients, and adding new clients. As a result of investments we have made in rela- tionship bankers, we have seen a 28 percent and 32 percent increase in net new relationships, respectively, in Business Banking serving smaller companies, and Global Commercial Banking serving middle-market companies. This is accom- panied by solid deposit growth in Global Banking overall, up 
9 percent at the end of 2018. Our teams earned top awards for providing the best client care in the industry, including Euromoney naming us the best bank in North America for small- and medium-sized enterprises. We received further recognition as the top Transaction Services bank in North America and best brand for cash management. 
Our customer-centered growth extends into our institu- tional investor segment. Through our investments in our Global Markets business, and increased balance sheet commitment to our clients, we have seen an expansion in our prime brokerage business. Over the last several years, we have invested heavily in new systems and expanded products and electronic trading for investor clients. This contributed to record revenues in our equities business and solid fixed income business performance. 
Growing within our Risk Framework 
Another core tenet of Responsible Growth is that we grow within our Risk Framework, and we had solid results in 2018. Total net charge-offs remained at decade-lows, while the net charge-off ratio declined 3 basis points to 41 basis points. All key asset quality metrics are solid. We are committed to being in a strong position to support clients throughout economic cycles. We have also managed market risk well during the turbulent markets in 2018, and our market risk indicators remain low. Through operational excellence we have also kept operational risk in check. 
Delivering sustainable Responsible Growth 
As I mentioned earlier, we ensure Responsible Growth is sustainable. This requires relentless progress across three dimensions: sharing our success with our communities; striving to be a great place to work for our employees; and driving operational excellence. We continued to make progress in each area in the past year. 
Sharing success with the communities we serve 
There are many ways we share our success. Our teammates volunteered 2 million hours supporting local organiza- tions in 2018, and we introduced enhancements to our employee giving and matching gift programs. For 2019, we are increasing total annual philanthropic giving across the company to $250 million from $200 million. Since 2010, 
we have extended nearly $2 billion in philanthropic giving across the markets we serve in the U.S. and abroad. 
Also in 2018, we provided $4.7 billion in loans, tax credit equity investments and real estate development solutions through our Community Development Banking business. We financed affordable housing for seniors, veterans and the formerly homeless, charter schools and economic develop- ment. Through our Capital Deployment Group, we have been developing innovative financing approaches to address global challenges outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including affordable housing, clean water and sanitation, education, health care and renewable energy. 
In recognition of the attention we pay to addressing these important priorities, I’m pleased that Bank of America was named the top global bank on Fortune magazine’s 2018 “Change the World” list. Fortune recognized our work mobi- lizing and deploying capital to address global challenges through our core business strategy. 
We know if we continue to align our work to serve shareholder interests and address the priorities of our communities at the same time, the progress can be sustain- able. I’ll discuss that in further detail below, and you can find an extended review of our work in these areas later
in this report, including a letter from Vice Chairman
Anne Finucane on page 22. 
Being a great place to work 
Another tenet of sustainability is ensuring we remain
a great place to work for our teammates; the record employee satisfaction scores in our 2018 annual employee survey demonstrate this commitment. Our teammates especially value how we provide for employee health and wellness. Between current U.S.-based employees and their families, and retirees, we are responsible for providing comprehensive health and wellness benefits to nearly 400,000 people. For the ninth consecutive year, we have held the cost of this benefit flat for the lowest-compensated employees, even as we continue to improve the coverage. For all employees, we have managed to keep increases below national averages. 
We also continue to make regular adjustments to starting- level compensation at our company. We have been a leader in establishing an internal minimum rate of pay for our U.S. hourly paid employees and have made regular increases over many years. Two years ago, we raised our minimum wage to $15 per hour, and our minimum wage is higher today. Our average rate for all U.S. hourly paid employees is significantly above this level. 
Our work in this area also includes employee development and opportunities for growth. We foster our client-centric culture through strategic workforce planning, anticipating the future of work and creating a culture of lifelong learning. In 2018, nearly 40,000 of our Consumer and Small Business employees completed a learning curriculum, giving them more skills for broader success. We hired more than 27,000 new teammates to the company last year (including 3,500 plus from colleges and universities); we helped more than 17,000 employees find new roles in the bank; and 
86 percent of eligible managers voluntarily participated in manager development courses to improve their skills. The implications are global; we also moved more than 5,000 jobs from non-U.S. markets to the U.S. over the last four years. 
Another area of focus has been sharing the benefits of
the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we have extended two special compensation awards, impacting approximately 90 percent (in 2017) and 95 percent (in 2018) of our team- mates globally. These awards included cash bonuses and stock, totaling more than $1 billion, and were in addition to the compensation these teammates otherwise received. 
Please look for more details in this report, and in our proxy statement, about all we do to be a great place to work, including a letter from Chief Human Resources Officer Sheri Bronstein on page 30. 
Driving operational excellence 
We also ensure that Responsible Growth is sustainable though our focus on operational excellence—continuous improvement in our internal and external processes to make it easier for our employees to work with each other and to serve clients and customers. By pursuing operational excel- lence, we are becoming more efficient, so we can continue to invest while providing you good returns. This makes all the other progress that I’ve discussed possible. 
Focusing on operational excellence allows us to continue to invest in our capabilities and in our team, even as we maintain expense discipline. While we face the same 
inflation and cost challenges all employers do (e.g., benefit increases, wage increases, real estate cost increases, more investment), we managed through them. We achieved our 2018 expense target of approximately $53 billion. We set that goal in mid-2016, when our annual expense run rate was $57 billion. Managing expenses well has contributed to four straight years of positive operative leverage and allowed us to grow pretax earnings at 18 percent in 2018 — all while investing in the company. 
I have mentioned some of the areas in which we are investing: adding relationship managers for our Global Banking clients, continuing to improve on our leading digital and mobile capabilities for all client segments and for our teammates, investing in health and wellness benefits for employees, our philanthropy increase, and the shared success bonuses we paid to 95 percent of our teammates in 2018. 
Since 2010, we have invested roughly $25 billion in new technology initiatives. This includes reworking effectively all of our major systems and adding innovative capabilities, while also building an internal cloud and software architec- ture for maximum efficiency and speed to market. 
Technology investments are directed at innovation across our company. Perhaps that is most apparent in the invest- ments we continue to make in our industry-leading online consumer platform and state-of-the-art branch network. EricaTM is one example. Our virtual banking assistant that combines interactive communications and artificial intelli- gence (AI) to learn and anticipate client needs is unique in the industry. Since we introduced Erica in spring 2018, more than 5 million customers have used the capability and the adoption rate is growing fast. 
Another innovation in which we’ve invested is ZelleTM, our peer-to-peer transfer capability enabled by our mobile app. Bank of America, along with other large banks, developed Zelle and we have extended full access to the capability to
a growing network of participating financial institutions. Customers of virtually any bank of any size can now send money to one another through the safety of their bank account in real time. Zelle transactions by our clients are growing over 100 percent a year, and we had nearly 5 million users at the end of 2018. And we’re just getting started. 
Another investment we’ve made is in our digital auto shopping experience, enabling customers to search, select a car, and get underwritten in real time. Customers can use our mobile app to search online for a car with access to thousands of dealers’ inventories, with over 1 million cars available. We have seen a seven-fold jump in financing applications in this area since launch in May 2017. 
Our investments in digital and mobile preferences for the customer have resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores and more deposits, while allowing us to reduce our branch count by more than 1,300 since 2012. 
And we continue to invest in improving our customer branch experience. Our 4,300 current centers are places where 
underwriting systems. For wealth management and invest- ment clients, we have automated investing tools, enhanced document scanning and client texting. 
Across our company, upgraded, integrated systems allow faster execution for customers with our enhanced reporting, robotics and automation. The application of advanced technology, coupled with our focus on client relationship management, creates a competitive advantage. And our universal, enter- prisewide platform increases our efficiency and helps us better serve clients and customers. All this, combined with our global reach, creates a tremendous capability for you. 
Remember, all this investment is driven by operational excellence — creating efficiency and investment in the future. The investments made in 2018 were extensive but we were able to reduce expenses through operational excel- lence. For 2019 and 2020, we expect expenses to remain flat even while we are making these investments. That makes our growth sustainable so we won’t have to pull back in times of slower economic growth. 
Committed to strong governance 
Please read the letter from Jack Bovender, our lead inde- pendent director, for a description of how the board of directors supports and oversees our strategy. Jack and our directors continue their practice of systematic investor engagement. In 2018, we met with shareholders holding more than 30 percent of our shares. Jack discusses this 
in further detail in his letter on the next page. 
We were pleased to welcome back to the board last year
Dr. Clayton S. Rose, who served as a director of our company from 2013 until 2015. Clayton was named president of Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine in 2015. He was able to rejoin our board last year and offers terrific perspective. We benefit from his insight on a range of issues. 
Operating at scale to address
important societal priorities
Earlier, I referenced challenges related to affordable housing, clean water, education, health care, renewable energy, energy efficiency and other critical areas outlined in the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The way I think of this is that, in effect, we asked the world through the efforts of the United Nations, “What would you like the power to do?” And the world spoke. Society would like to see timely progress in addressing these priorities. 
The issues are, of course, a concern to policymakers and elected officials at every level of government. But they are also a concern to our teammates, our customers and clients, the communities we serve, and our shareholders. 
At Bank of America, we realize there is a significant gap between the capital that must be applied to these global challenges and the amount that is currently being spent. Credible estimates of what is needed to address the U.N. SDGs is about $6 trillion per year; the current annual funding gap is as much as half that. 
Government alone can’t solve these challenges. The U.S. government, with the largest economy in the world, will spend more than $4 trillion this year. But almost two-thirds of those total expenditures are committed to non-discretionary needs: funding the social safety net, servicing U.S. debt and other commitments. The discretionary elements of the budget include national security, education, health care and other priorities. The same is true for other governments and econ- omies around the world. The government budgets are fully committed, and in many cases in difficult shape, so counting on governments to spend more is not a likely solution. 
Charitable giving alone also cannot fill the need. Annual giving from individuals, foundations, and corporations is spread across many worthy causes and, even in the aggregate, falls short. The U.S. is the largest philanthropic giver in the world as a percentage of GDP. Total giving to charitable organiza- tions overall in the world was around $800 billion in 2017 and $410 billion in the U.S., primarily from individuals. Assets by foundations in the world are estimated at about $1.5 trillion; nearly half of that is held by foundations in the U.S. at $890 billion. Again, even if we spent all that money in a single year, it would be insufficient to close the gap. 
We operate in nearly 300 cities, towns, and communities, consolidated into 92 distinct markets in the United States, and in three dozen countries around the world. We are
part of the fabric of those communities, where our 200,000 teammates live, work, and raise their families. 
Public companies that employ and invest at the scale that
we and others do are well-positioned to address income inequality, clean energy, health care, and affordable housing through thought leadership, investment, innovation, mobili- zation of capital and in other ways. Private-sector leadership is necessary because solutions involving capitalism are inher- ently sustainable, and the returns will bring continued and increasing investment. 
But, as the great student of business and author Jim Collins has said, we have to embrace “the genius of the AND.” We have to do our part to achieve strong and timely progress on the sustainable development goals AND we have to deliver 
strong returns to you, our shareholders, as we do so. This enables us to keep addressing these important priorities. We are doing this, and we are committed to doing more. 
How does Bank of America do this? 
First, we continue to align our expense base and our balance sheet to find every business opportunity to provide good returns and to make progress toward our goals. We do this by financing new energy sources, by financing affordable housing, and by financing other types of development. These financing opportunities provide a return for investors while making progress on the goals. 
Second, we bring thought leadership to the discussion. Our Research team has demonstrated that companies adhering to sound environment, social, and governance (ESG) practices will avoid serious issues. In fact, their research shows that investors could have avoided almost all of the bankruptcies of the last several years by avoiding companies that do not have good metrics on ESG. Increasingly, investors are looking for that kind of adherence in making investment decisions. This is driving more private-sector investment capital from institutional investors toward companies that are addressing 
these priorities. We also see this in our wealth manage-
ment businesses, where we are meeting client demands
to construct portfolios focused on companies that meet standards consistent with progress toward the sustainable development goals. The practice is growing. By harnessing private capital in this manner, the alignment we create can help fill the gap left by limitations in government and phil- anthropic spending by bringing more resources, capital, and expense to the task. In addition, we can be a catalyst for others to act. Our expertise, credibility, and ability to assess the opportunities can help others who have the desire but may lack the expertise to deploy capital. 
Third, we contribute in the ways we manage our own activities. We are more than halfway through our 10-year, $125 billion Environmental Business Initiative, supporting clients and others who are helping create a sustainable energy future. We also focus on our own sustainable facilities management and improved energy efficiency. For instance, we have set a goal to be carbon neutral by the end of 2020. 
We also run your company to provide great opportunities for teammates. We hire from a diverse range of locations and 
800,000 customers come each day to talk with a relation- ship or product specialist for the financial advice, products and services they need. 
In 2016, we announced our plans to renovate our financial centers and upgrade our ATMs nationwide to better serve our clients, expand our consumer and small business services into new markets, and grow our presence in existing markets. I provided an update last year, including our intention to expand our financial center presence in nine new markets to offer retail banking, lending, small business and investment services. Today, we cover more than 80 percent of the U.S. population with our retail branch footprint. With the sched- uled investments, we will cover more than 90 percent. 
We continued to execute this plan in 2018. We expanded our presence in 25 markets, including our newest — Denver, Minneapolis, and Indianapolis. We also entered the Pittsburgh market in 2018, and will be opening our first financial center in Salt Lake City in early 2019. In addition to opening 81 new financial centers last year, we completed renovations on 567 others. We are redesigning more than 2,500 financial centers by 2021 to make it easier for clients to access our banking and investing professionals for advice on their life priorities and financial goals. Adding financial centers also helps drive local employment, as we have added teammates across the new centers. 
Look for a more detailed discussion of our high-tech, high-touch capabilities with Dean Athanasia, president of Consumer and Small Business, on page 15 of this report. 
While our investments may be most apparent in the Consumer and Small Business segment, we are investing and innovating to better serve all of our clients. We have extended our mobile consumer experience into
our commercial banking digital platform, with capabili- ties that enable treasurers of companies, both large and small, to transact with the same mobile convenience. This innovation benefits the clients whom we assist with markets-related services and activities, such as electronic trading, algorithms, analytical capabilities, systems and data management, and counterparty risk management and backgrounds, and provide opportunities for teammates to pursue their own path and excel. That kind of opportunity for success allows a teammate to join us, for instance, from a low- or moderate- income neighborhood (as did more than
30 percent of our Consumer and Small Business external hires last year) and move into future openings throughout our company based on their own merit and desire. 
Fourth, our own ESG work makes a direct impact. The direct investments we make, the volunteer efforts of our teammates, our philanthropic works—all of this helps address the challenges. While our own ESG work through giving and volunteerism cannot solve the challenges as we have relayed, we are proud of what our teammates directly do to help make progress on these priorities. 
Let me give some examples of the different types of activities set forth above: 
Bank of America committed more than $50 billion last year in lending, investing and philanthropy to deploy capital toward the SDGs. In fall 2018, we created
a special $60 million Blended Finance Catalyst Pool to encourage more compa- nies to participate in addressing those priorities. Our blended finance initiative combines different sources of capital for a targeted objective, in order to accom- modate different risk tolerances and rates of return. As this approach expands over time, we can create the capacity to mobilize vast amounts of capital and achieve the scale necessary to fundamentally address global challenges driven by the force of private-sector capital returns. 
In one of the first commitments of our catalyst pool, we joined with two other financial services companies in our headquarter city of Charlotte, North Carolina, to extend more than $70 million to fund low-income housing developments. Most of that amount will be low-interest loans to private developers building income-restricted housing. 
We believe it is not only possible, but it is the desired outcome for Bank of America as a public company to simultaneously serve our clients, deliver for
our shareholders AND address these local, national, and global social priorities. Delivering on both aspects of the “AND” is the way to ensure that we can continue to channel the capital from others and from our company that is needed to fund societal needs. We all have to provide great returns, while delivering on the goals. 
Our teammates are called upon in every community where they live and work to lead efforts that promote economic and social development, and I am proud of how they step in to help. We welcome the continued interest of elected officials in these efforts and engage them across the cities, towns and communities we serve. Our commitment is a core element of Respon"
"ible Gr""",,,,
Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2000,"It is with a great deal of pride and plea- sure that I take this opportunity to tell you about the tremendous success our company achieved in the year 2000. 
First, our financial performance was superb, setting a new standard in the history of Chevron. Operationally, our performance was much improved, 
as we set several records for safety, reliability and production. We continued to build increased organizational capability in the key drivers of business success. And we announced plans to merge with Texaco to build a stronger company for the long term. 
The most historic achievement of 2000 was our net income of $5.2 billion, by far the highest in the company’s 121-year his- tory. That performance benefited from sustained high prices for crude oil and natural gas, combined with strong refining mar- gins, particularly in the United States. Underlying these results, however, was solid operating performance. For example, we increased our oil and gas production 3 percent from the year before, thereby taking advantage of high prices. 
Improved reliability at our refineries resulted in higher pro- duction of value-added products, improving our profits while meeting our customers’ needs when supplies were tight. In every operation, employees focused on improving safety and reliability, while at the same time continuing their focus on reducing costs. For example, improved processes for global procurement of goods and services saved more than $250 million during 2000 in oper- ating expenses and capital expenditures. 
The result of strong industry conditions and improved oper- ating performance was a return on capital employed of 22 per- cent, excluding special items, an achievement that ranked No.1 among our industry peers worldwide. 
While these were important accomplishments during 2000, we also took several steps to strengthen the company for the long term by: 
•	replacing more than 150 percent of the oil and gas we produced in 2000 through new discoveries, acquisitions and other additions – the eighth consecutive year the com- pany has added more reserves than it has produced; 
•	reducing our debt ratio to 24 percent, the lowest since our 1984 merger with Gulf; 
•	implementing a $6 billion capital and exploratory spend- ing plan for 2001, focused on our strategic priority to profitably grow our upstream (exploration and production) business; 
•	repurchasing $1.4 billion of common shares through a stock buyback program; 
•	strengthening our chemicals business by forming a world- class joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Company. 
Last year, we set two challenging goals for the five-year pe- riod from 2000 through 2004 – to be No.1 in total stockholder return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) relative to our peers and to achieve a minimum of 12 percent return on capital employed while continuing to grow the company. 
We said that achieving our goals would require superior performance in four key areas – operational excellence, cost reduc- tion, capital stewardship and profitable growth – and that build- ing organizational capability in each would be critical to achieving our financial goals. We call these priorities “4 plus 1.” I’d like
to update you on our progress, which has been very good to date. 
In 2000 and 2001, we are focusing initially on building world-class organizational capability in two of those areas – operational excellence and capital stewardship. 
We’ve already achieved demonstrable progress in operational excellence, which entails safe, reliable, efficient and environmen- tally sound performance companywide. For example, in the up- stream, our oil production operations at the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan have attained 12 million hours without a lost-time incident while also achieving new production records. In the downstream (refining and marketing), our North American refin- eries have had their best safety performance ever. These and other accomplishments are detailed elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
Despite our progress, it is essential that we continue to im- prove in safety, reliability, efficiency and environmental performance. We are building our capability through better work processes, enhanced training and certification, more rapid sharing of lessons learned, and increased focus on recognition and accountability. 
The other area for enhanced organizational capability is capi- tal stewardship, wisely investing our money – a key element for a company our size with a capital and exploratory budget of $6 bil- lion. We’ve been seeing improvements in capital efficiency as our decision and execution processes are more widely deployed and lessons learned are shared across the organization. 
We are increasing our organizational skills by providing project teams with improved decision-making tools and by con- tinuing a rigorous analysis of completed projects so that lessons learned can be incorporated into the decisions and execution of future projects. For example, in the international upstream, these techniques have been applied in areas ranging from the North Sea and Angola to Australia and Canada – and they have led to important progress in shortening the time from discovery to first oil production; in the design, construction and start-up of pro- duction facilities; and in overall project cost. 
You can be proud of Chevron’s talented work force and the progress employees have made in these areas, as well as their aspi- rations to be world-class in each. 
As I write this letter in February, we’re making excellent progress in our proposed merger with Texaco. 
ChevronTexaco Corporation will have: 
•	top-tier upstream positions, with reserves of 11.2 billion 
barrels of oil equivalent; 
•	production of 2.7 million barrels per day and excellent 
exploration opportunities; 
•	an integrated, worldwide refining and marketing business; 
•	a global chemicals business and significant growth plat- 
forms in natural gas and power; 
•	industry-leading skills in technology innovation. 
The merger will bring together two leading energy compa- nies to form a global enterprise that, working from $78 billion in assets, is highly competitive across all energy sectors, is pro- jected to achieve at least $1.2 billion in annual cost savings and is well positioned for growth. 
In short, everything we’ve learned since the merger announce- ment in October has reinforced a positive outlook for the pro- posed new company. That’s especially true in one very important way: As the two companies begin to work together to make the merger a success, we’re already seeing evidence of a shared vision and teamwork that are at the heart of any successful venture. And we share common values, including protecting the environment, partnering with the communities where we operate, and promot- ing diversity and opportunity in our work force. 
Our strong base business, our progress in developing a top- notch organization and our proposed merger with Texaco position us to prosper in a world where energy, in all its forms, is central to economic and social progress. 
Energy: vital to economic growth 
Concerns about global oil prices and availability, as well as regional natural gas and electricity supply and prices, have been very much in the news. Events of the past year have heightened the public’s awareness of how much our well-being depends on sufficient supplies of affordable energy, efficiently utilized. 
Energy is a key input to a healthy economy that is increas- ingly global, interdependent and dynamic – with enormous potential for improving the lives of people everywhere. 
The United States has a special responsibility to support energy progress. As the largest economy in the world, inextrica- bly linked to the global economy, our nation should take a lead- ership role in developing a long-term strategy to ensure that energy supplies are sufficient to support growth. 
We at Chevron are committed to doing our part to responsi- bly develop energy supplies and services. When we complete our proposed merger with Texaco, the new ChevronTexaco Corpora- tion will be even better positioned to fulfill that role. We will have the assets, financial strength and people to make a difference. 
Chevron will be a vital partner in creating the energy that fuels progress. By doing so, we will serve our customers, the com- munities in which we operate and our stockholders. 
I’m very positive about the outlook for our company and very proud of the commitment and performance of the many thousands of Chevron people who have contributed to our success. 


"
Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2001,"Last October’s creation of ChevronTexaco Corporation, on time and as planned, was a major achievement that we’re proud of. The tragic events of September 11, however, overshadowed the merger and tempered our sense of celebration. The terrorist attacks were a reminder – a terrible one – of how interconnected the world has become. 
This interdependence can and should be a force for positive change – all the more reason for those of us in the global energy industry to work with renewed intensity. When we do a good job of providing communities around the world with the energy they need for economic growth and an improved quality of life, we also create value for our stockholders. The intent of uniting Chevron and Texaco is to better equip us to do that job. 
We can already see an interlocking of strengths in the rapid integration of our busi- nesses and increased scope of our operations. We expect to be realizing $1.8 billion in annual synergies by the second quarter 2003. And we’re raising our sights higher still. 
Now active in more than 180 countries and doing business on a much larger scale, we intend to be a leader and innovator wherever we operate. The true measure of success, however, is not whether we have grown bigger but whether we have become better and how that translates into improved results. We are confident that we can achieve these results. 
Staying focused 
Even as the nuts and bolts of the merger were being fitted, some important achieve- ments to further strengthen the company were being realized. 
_	We replaced 127 percent of the oil and gas we produced in 2001 – through discov- eries, acquisitions and other additions. That marked the ninth consecutive year the company has added more reserves than it has produced. 
_	We successfully started up a number of oil and gas operations. Typhoon began operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Hamaca oil field in Venezuela is off to a good start, as are North Nemba (right) and a new phase of Kuito, both off- shore Angola. In addition, the Malampaya gas project in the Philippines began production. Collectively, these projects will contribute an average of more than 80,000 net oil-equivalent barrels a day in 2002. 
_	Many of our historically strong oil-producing regions continued to perform exceptionally well. North Sea production averaged more than 240,000 barrels of net oil-equivalent a day, and the shelf area of the Gulf of Mexico averaged more than 360,000 barrels per day. 
_	We successfully began operations of the Caspian Pipeline connecting the huge Tengiz oil field to the Russian port city of Novorossiysk. Earlier in the year, we increased to 50 percent our interest in Tengizchevroil, our joint venture with the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
_	U.S. refining and marketing had outstanding earnings in 2001, reflecting improved margins, higher refinery utilization, and improved product yield and reliability. 
_	We have begun implementing a $9.4 billion capital and exploratory program for 2002. This is lower than the combined companies’ 2001 expenditures and represents a focus on high-impact, long-term exploration and production growth projects. 
_	The sale of Texaco’s interests in the U.S. refining and marketing joint ventures Equilon and Motiva was completed in February 2002, with the company realizing $2.2 billion in cash. 

Our 2001 operating earnings were a solid $6.8 billion. One-time merger costs and spe- cial items reduced net income to $3.3 billion. Special charges, coupled with weak mar- ket fundamentals at year-end, led to a disappointing fourth quarter. There’s no reason, however, for a single quarter’s weak results to cloud our view going forward. As with any temporary downturn, we are staying focused on executing our plans to create value for our stockholders. 
Our main business objective is to be No.1 among our peers in total stockholder return for the period 2000 through 2004. We were No.1 for the two-year period 2000 through 2001, and we’re moving aggressively to retain that position. 
Vision and values 
During the merger planning process, one of the early tasks of the new leadership team was to agree on a vision. Our consensus was to aim high: to be the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. 
We then developed a document, built on our vision, called The ChevronTexaco Way.
It is a statement of who we are and what we believe. It includes our performance goals, our ambitions and how we plan to conduct business. The ChevronTexaco Way empha- sizes not only financial and operating results, but our commitment to achieving them with integrity, accountability, and open and honest communications. 
The first pillar of our vision is people. The ChevronTexaco work force is truly global
and diverse, and that is an enormous strength. Together, we have one of the best teams in t he business – not just because of our collective skills, but because we place a pre- mium on values. Every day, in communities around the world, we demonstrate that what counts is not just whether we get results, but how we get them. 
The first companywide communication effort following the merger was about The ChevronTexaco Way and the importance of our shared values. By early 2002, in hun- dreds of meetings around the world, we had brought together virtually all employees to discuss and understand them. 
It has been thrilling to see what happens when you unite people with different busi- ness, cultural and geographic backgrounds: the surfacing of new ideas, the sharing of best practices and fresh perspectives, a vitality even greater than I had imagined. We are creating a new culture from the very best of Chevron, Texaco and Caltex. 
The second pillar of our vision is partnership. Simply put, we strive to be the partner
of choice. The people of ChevronTexaco have an unrivaled reputation for establishing productive partnerships with governments, other companies and communities. We have a proven ability to build lasting business relationships that reach deep into the communities where we work. 
A commitment to partnership is embedded deeply in our culture, dating back some
70 years. It’s exemplified in the earliest oil discoveries in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, in the creation of Caltex and, more recently, in our successful developments in Kazakh- stan and the greater Caspian region. 
The third pillar of our vision is performance. Sustained, world-class performance is a requirement to create superior value for our stockholders. We call this ambition “4+1.” We believe that ChevronTexaco must be world-class in four key areas: 
_	operational excellence through safe, reliable, efficient and environmentally sound operations; 
_	cost reduction by lowering unit costs through innovation and technology; 
_	capital stewardship by investing in the best project opportunities and executing 
them successfully (safer, faster, at lower cost); 
_	profitable growth through leadership in developing new business opportunities in both existing and new markets. 

Success in these four key areas will be achieved by building world-class organizational capability (the “plus 1”). During the merger process, we continued our focus on two key areas of 4+1: building organizational capability in operational excellence and capital stewardship. Hundreds of leaders have been and are being trained in the key elements of both. 
And that effort is paying off. Last year was our best ever for safety. We also achieved world-class ranking in a benchmark study of the efficiency of our U.S. refining system’s capital spending. And our energy efficiency has improved steadily: We now use 20 per- cent less energy per unit of output than we did a decade ago. 
Building capability is the key to sustained performance improvement; 4+1 is our road map to get there. 
Prepared for the future 
Sufficient energy supplies, delivered in an environmentally sound manner, will always be critical to economic growth and prosperity around the world. We are committed to providing that energy and, with our increased scale and scope, are better able to fill that important role. Regardless of industry conditions, I believe we have the strategic focus and the opportunities to be the top performer in the business. My belief rests on our talented and dedicated work force and their disciplined approach to managing assets, building a strong portfolio and expanding partnerships. 
I’m excited about our future and grateful for the tremendous work of all ChevronTexaco employees around the world. Their commitment, effort and enthusiasm make it possible for our new company to move forward on a solid footing. I’m confident that, working together, we will deliver superior sustained performance and meet the high expectations of our customers, the communities in which we operate and you, our stockholders.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2002,"ChevronTexaco ended its first year following the merger with many notable achievements but with a clear challenge to improve the company’s financial performance. 
Net income for 2002 was down more than 65 percent compared with the previous year. Likewise, the value of our company’s stock – as with that of others in the energy industry and the broader market – experienced a sharp downturn. 
We are not satisfied with these results, and we are working aggressively to achieve substantial and sustainable improvement in the performance of all our businesses. 
As we improve, we are building on a solid foundation, including a strong balance sheet and excellent investment opportunities that the merger, completed in late 2001, provided. Today, we have the size, scope and financial capabilities to create greater value for our stockholders. 
The merger also has enabled us to deliver major cost savings. By the end of the first quarter of 2003, the company will have achieved an annual synergy capture rate of $2.2 billion – far higher than the $1.2 billion we had estimated at the outset. 
STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS 
Our most immediate challenge is to improve the returns on our invested capital. Our strategies to accomplish this are focused on improving the performance of our existing assets, developing new assets that can deliver superior returns and exiting those assets that do not offer the long-term potential to create value for you, our stockholders. 
In the upstream business, we have leading posi- tions in some of the most promising regions of the world, including Eurasia, West Africa, Latin America, Australia and the U.S. deep- water Gulf of Mexico. We have a portfolio of major projects that will come onstream during the next five years, contributing significantly to production and reserves. We also intend to build a profitable global natural gas business, based on our large developed and undevel- oped gas positions in North America, Africa and Australia. 
In downstream operations, we are focusing on improving the performance of our refining and marketing businesses by capitalizing on our larger scale to lower costs and competi- tively leveraging our enhanced market and supply positions. 
Throughout our worldwide operations, we continue to focus on building organizational capability in two areas that are critical to our success – capital stewardship and operational excellence. In capital stewardship, we have 
been working to improve decision quality and project execution, and we are seeing measur- able progress. For example, at $8.5 billion, our 2003 capital and exploratory budget is 17 per- cent lower than the combined budget of the pre-merger companies, yet it fully satisfies our strategic priorities. 
We also are making strides in operational excel- lence, which means running our businesses safely, reliably and efficiently. 2002 was the safest year ever for employees and contractors, a notable achievement that occurred during 
a period of major transition. At the same time, our worldwide refinery utilization rate increased to 91 percent, and we have set targets for increased reliability in all our businesses. 
If you take only one message from this annual report, it should be that ChevronTexaco is indeed “up to the challenge” of improving its financial performance. By aggressively imple- menting our strategies, we intend to deliver strong results and overcome the challenges that negatively affected our performance in 2002. 
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW 
Weak global economies, restrained demand for petroleum products and lower production all took a toll on 2002 earnings. For the year, ChevronTexaco reported net income of $1.1 bil- lion, compared with $3.3 billion in 2001. 
The company’s financial results were hurt by $3.3 billion of charges from special items. About $2.3 billion of these charges were related to our 26 percent ownership of Dynegy Inc., an energy trading company that saw a dramatic decline in its market value due to the near col- lapse of the energy merchant sector. 
Exploration and production income of $4.6 bil- lion was about 6 percent higher than in 2001, reflecting lower asset write-downs, which were offset partially by a decline in oil-equivalent production and weaker U.S. natural gas prices. 
Refining, marketing and transportation posted a loss of nearly $400 million in 2002, compared with income of $1.8 billion the previous year. The poor 2002 results reflected weak margins 
for refined products, which early in the year fell to their lowest levels in more than a decade. 
In chemicals, the combined income of Chevron Oronite, which produces additives for fuels and lubricants, and our 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC was $86 mil- lion, compared with a $128 million loss the previous year. Although results improved, the commodity chemicals industry continues to be affected by weak demand and excess manu- facturing capacity. 
A YEAR OF PROGRESS AND POSITIVE CHANGE 
Despite many challenges, 2002 was a year of progress and positive change. Perhaps the most important achievement was the success- ful integration of the operations, organizations and people of Chevron and Texaco. Through- out our global enterprise, we came together as a unified company with shared values and a common vision. 
We also marked several other milestones during the year: 
•	Our exploration program benefited from the best technology, processes and practices of the pre-merger companies. Some of our most notable successes were achieved in the deep waters of West Africa and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including the Usan and Aparo dis- coveries offshore Nigeria, the Gabela and Negage discoveries offshore Angola, and 
the Tahiti and Great White discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico. 
•	For the 10th consecutive year, we added more oil-equivalent proved reserves than we pro- duced. Through discoveries, acquisitions and other additions, we replaced 114 percent of our 2002 production. 
•	We added significant amounts of proved reserves to our natural gas resource base and made progress on several major projects. For example, ChevronTexaco and five other par- ticipants in Australia’s North West Shelf Venture signed a conditional 25-year contract with the People’s Republic of China to supply up to 
3 million metric tons a year of liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) for the proposed Guangdong LNG project in southern China. 
• In the Caspian region, we moved forward to improve both our production and trans- portation systems. Our Tengizchevroil (TCO) partnership increased production for the ninth consecutive year. Also, in the second half of the year, TCO was able to transport all its crude oil through the more cost-effective Caspian Pipeline Consortium’s 935-mile (1,505-kilo- meter) pipeline to Novorossiysk, a Russian port on the Black Sea. In 2003, we expect to com- plete a second pipeline, which will link our 20 percent-owned Karachaganak Field to the Caspian pipeline. 
• The company’s annual dividend payment increased for the 15th consecutive year, reflect- ing our commitment to provide a superior return on our stockholders’ investment. 
UP TO THE CHALLENGE 
I am proud of the progress we made in our first year as ChevronTexaco. As we look to the future, we are facing the uncertainty of 
a struggling global economy. Yet, there are extraordinary opportunities for a company with our capabilities. 
ChevronTexaco is a major player in the global energy industry. And we are focused on our most important financial objective – to be No. 1 among our largest global competitors in total stockholder return for the period 2000 
through 2004. 
We have an active, independent Board of Directors that brings a wealth of experience to this important role – including expertise in government, education, industrial manu- facturing, consumer products and high technology. The integrity, knowledge and perspectives of our Board are invaluable
to ChevronTexaco as we make decisions that will enable us to achieve our ambitious goals. 
Our company values, too, are essential as we pursue our objectives. In everything we do, we are guided by our commitment to conduct our business in a responsible and ethical manner. We respect the law, support universal human rights, protect the environment and 
benefit the communities in which we operate. By holding firm to our values, we are moving toward our vision of being the global energy company most admired for its people, partner- ship and performance. 
It is no accident that people are listed first in our vision statement. Our diverse global work force is the most important factor in our 
success, and I applaud the 53,000 employees
of ChevronTexaco for their contributions. It
is through their work that the company is wel- comed around the world and has become a partner of choice in some of the most impor- tant projects in the energy industry. And it is through the work of ChevronTexaco people that we will prove we are up to the challenge of delivering the performance our stockholders expect of us and we expect of ourselves. 
"
Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2003,"Last year, I wrote of the challenge ChevronTexaco faced to improve its financial performance. I am pleased to report that we are succeeding. Not only was 2003 one of our best years ever, but we also built a solid foundation that should enable us to deliver sustained, strong performance into the future and continue to achieve our long-stated goal to be No. 1 in total stockholder return among our peer group. 
In 2003, net income was $7.2 billion, resulting in a 15.7 percent annual return on capital employed. Our strong cash flow enabled us to reduce debt $3.7 billion, ending the year with a total debt to total debt-plus-equity ratio of 25.8 percent. For the 16th consecutive year, we increased our annual dividend payment. Our financial performance was reflected in our total stockholder return of 35.2 percent in 2003. Since 2000, we have led our largest three com- petitors in total stockholder return. 
Other significant achievements included: 
•	continuing successes in exploration, with major new discoveries in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria; 
•	replacing more than 100 percent of production for the 11th consecutive year; 
•	achieving significant progress in major upstream projects in Angola, Canada, Chad, Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Venezuela; 
•	establishing a global natural gas business and achieving milestones in the commercialization of our vast Australian 
and West African gas resources; 
•	significantly improving performance in refining and marketing. 
OUR STRATEGIES – STEPPING UP THE PACE Our global upstream strategy is to grow profitability in our core areas and build new legacy positions. We are well positioned to do both. Our crude oil and natural gas production is located in large basins around the globe where we have existing infrastructure and are typically one of the top three producers. We have a queue of projects that will add to production throughout the decade and beyond. We hold exploratory acreage in some of the most promising regions of the world, and we are confident we can build on an already successful exploratory program. In 2003, we established a business development group responsible for identifying and developing new, large-scale resource opportunities throughout the world. 
Our global natural gas strategy is to commercialize our large equity resource base by targeting the rapidly growing North American and Asian markets. In the Atlantic Basin, we are pursuing several liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects that would supply the first offshore LNG regasification terminal in the United States. In the Pacific Basin, we are expanding our successful LNG business in Australia to supply markets in North America and Asia. We also are moving forward on a gas-to-liquids project in Nigeria. 
Our global downstream strategy is to improve future returns by focusing on areas of market and supply strength. Our core areas of operation include the U.S. West Coast, U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Asia and Latin America. In 2003, we initiated a major restructuring of our global downstream operations. We are committed to achieving before-tax profit improvements of $500 million by the end of 2005 through cost reductions, efficiency improvements and the standardization of key work processes. 
DELIVERING TOP PERFORMANCE While we are proud of the value we have created, we recognize that the confi- dence of stockholders rests in their expectation of future performance, not in past accomplishments. 
To deliver the performance you expect, we will continue to focus on operational excellence and capital stewardship. Operational excellence means safe, reliable and environmentally sound execution. 2003 was our safest year ever. Reliability metrics improved in many areas, as did environmental performance. Capital stewardship means making better-quality expenditure decisions and executing projects well. We have made considerable progress in both areas, resulting in improved capital allocation and efficiency over the past three years. 
The successes we enjoyed in 2003 came from the contributions of the talented men and women of ChevronTexaco. They embraced the challenge and delivered results – and did so the right way, by acting with integrity and high ethical standards. 
Many of our employees work in some of the world’s most challenging regions. This year, our company was honored to receive the U.S. Department of State’s 2003 Award for Corporate Excellence. The award recognized the sustained efforts of our employees in Nigeria to contribute to a higher quality of life in that country. 
125 YEARS OF PROGRESS As we look ahead, we see many opportunities to create ever-higher value for our stock- holders, and we are well positioned to compete for those opportunities. We have a strong balance sheet, a portfolio of excellent assets, leading-edge technology, and talented and committed people. 
In 2004, we will mark the 125th anniversary of the incorporation of the Pacific Coast Oil Company, the oldest pred- ecessor company of ChevronTexaco. For 125 years, we have produced reliable, affordable energy and have taken pride in knowing that the energy we produce is a building block for economic development and helps improve the standard of living around the world. This anniversary causes us to reflect upon our past accomplishments and successes, but it also reminds us of our responsibility to build for the next 125 years. 
"
Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2004,"In 2004, our company delivered the strongest financial performance in its 125-year history. Net income was $13.3 billion. We outperformed our peers in return on capital employed, a key meas- ure of overall company performance. We strengthened our balance sheet, reducing our debt level by $1.3 billion and ending the year with cash and marketable securities of $10.7 billion. Most sig- nificant, we achieved a total stockholder return for the year of 25.5 percent and accomplished our five-year goal to be a leader among our three largest peers in this measure, posting an annualized return of 7.4 percent for 2000 through 2004. This was 9.7 percentage points higher than Standard & Poor’s 500 return over the same five-year period. 
We increased our annual dividend payments for the 17th consecutive year and returned value to stockholders through the launch of a common stock buyback program of up to $5 billion by 2007. At the end of 2004, we had repurchased shares in the open market totaling more than $2 billion. 
We accomplished all of this while having our safest year ever – a core value at ChevronTexaco. 
RIGHT STRATEGIES 
Our performance was driven by executing well against the right strategies at the right time. In upstream, our strategic focus is on growing profitability in core areas and building new legacy positions. Our natural gas strategy targets the commercialization of our significant international resource base for delivery to North American and Asian markets. In downstream, our strategic priority is to enhance returns by focusing on areas of market and supply strength. 
Oil demand has been stronger than predicted, and spare capacity has been reduced. With almost 75 percent of our production in crude oil, we are well positioned to benefit from higher prices. At the same time, refining margins have been particularly strong in Asia and the U.S. West Coast and Sun Belt, where the company has a majority of its refining capacity. 
STRONG FOCUS, EXECUTION, GROWTH 
While the industry benefited from high commodity prices this past year, ChevronTexaco’s per- formance was enhanced by strong execution against its strategic objectives. Specific achievements included strong exploration results, with potentially significant new crude oil and natural gas dis- coveries in North America, Europe, Australia, Africa and Latin America. We also continued our portfolio rationalization through the sale of nonstrategic production assets at a time when we could take advantage of high market prices. In 2004, our downstream operations were aligned functionally across the globe. This resulted in operating and efficiency gains and produced sig- nificant earnings improvements. We also made solid progress toward commercializing our equity natural gas resource base, most notably by securing long-term regasification capacity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and obtaining key permits for a planned Baja California, Mexico, liquefied natural gas import terminal. 
We continued to focus on integrating our operations across the enterprise to capture efficiencies and create new value. For example, we modified our Pembroke Refinery in the United Kingdom to process market-disadvantaged equity crude oil from our Chad operations in Africa into high-quality gasoline blendstocks for North America. We have combined separate groups to create a single organi- zation to manage technology for upstream and downstream. This approach, which is unique in the industry, allows us to optimize technology solutions across the enterprise, from the reservoir to the retail pump. 
Looking forward, our growth opportunities are excellent. We are aggressively managing pro- duction decline rates in mature fields, adding exploration acreage in key areas and building a world-class portfolio of capital projects – Benguela Belize-Lobito Tomboco in Angola, Agbami in Nigeria, Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico and the Tengizchevroil expansion in Kazakhstan. All of these projects are scheduled to come online over the next four years, contributing to our oil-equivalent production goal of 3 million barrels a day by 2008. 
A NEW EQUATION 
We are at a strategic inflection point in our industry. The convergence of growing demand, chal- lenging resource locations such as the deep water and oil sands, a need for greater diversity of energy supplies, a complex geopolitical environment, and a shifting competitive landscape have created a fundamentally new energy equation. 
ChevronTexaco is strongly positioned to succeed in this new environment. We have robust strate- gies that have been tested under a variety of market conditions. We are committed to achieving and maintaining world-class levels of operating and capital discipline. We are leveraging technol- ogy to create operating efficiencies in the near term and develop promising new energy sources for the long term. We are continuing to build on our efforts to be the partner of choice in strategic energy regions of the world. 
A strong reflection of our commitment to partnership occurred in 2004 when our Board of Directors held a meeting in Angola to review our business operations, witness our commu- nity engagement projects and visit with the country’s leadership. It was one of the first times
a Board from a major multinational company has met in sub-Saharan Africa, and it was an affirmation of our continuing commitment to this continent. 
Even with sound strategies and a strong balance sheet, the critical factor for success is having the right people in the right positions doing the right things. ChevronTexaco’s people per- formed superbly in 2004, and we are continuing to enhance the capabilities and commitment of our global work force. We have a strong management team with a proven track record and a dedicated, experienced Board. We look forward to the opportunities we face in the coming
year to increase competitive returns and stockholder value and to deliver the energy
needed to fuel economic development and growth around the world.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2005,"2005 was a year of unprecedented accomplishment and challenge for 
our company. 
We reported record earnings and completed the acquisi- tion and integration of Unocal. We made major new discoveries of crude oil and natural gas and took sig- nificant steps to expand our global natural gas business. Although our employees and facilities sustained damage from back-to-back hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf Coast, we are recovering with remarkable resilience and efficiency. 
Our financial performance reflects the capital discipline that is necessary to create sustained value and growth. Net income in 2005 was $14.1 billion on sales and other operating revenues of $194 billion – representing record levels in both categories. Return on capital employed for the year was a strong 21.9 percent. We increased our divi- dend in 2005 for the 18th consecutive year, completed the purchase of $5 billion of the company’s shares in the open market under a program started in 2004 and initiated a new program to acquire up to an additional $5 billion of shares over a period of up to three years. A critical mea- sure of our performance, total stockholder return (TSR), was 11.3 percent for 2005. From 2001 through 2005, TSR averaged 9.7 percent, among the highest of our larger peer companies. 
MAINTAINING MOMENTUM We executed strongly against our key business strategies in 2005, enhancing our foundation for current and future growth. The suc- cessful integration of Unocal’s operations strengthened our competitive profile in key markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, where we are in the top tier of natural gas producers. Unocal’s world-class assets in Asia, the Cas- pian and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are a superb strategic fit with Chevron’s portfolio and capabilities. In addition, Unocal provided us with a deep source of talent and lead- ing-edge technology, particularly with the drill bit, that we are integrating throughout our enterprise. 
We enhanced our position in the deep water with dis- coveries at Big Foot and Knotty Head in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and at Manatee offshore Trinidad and Tobago, among others. Our combination of experience and applied technology resulted in a total of 31 successful exploration wells in 2005 and an exploration success rate of 58 percent, one of the best in the industry. 
We reached key milestones in our queue of major capital projects, most notably the Benguela Belize-Lobito Tomboco deepwater project in Angola, which is the first of our “Big 5” projects to begin production. We began construction of production facilities for the Tahiti (U.S.) and Agbami (Nigeria) deepwater projects, as well as the Escravos gas-to-liquids plant in Nigeria. Our global gas business reached key agreements with Japanese utility companies for future sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Gorgon project in Australia into Japan, the world’s largest LNG market. 
Refining and marketing operations benefited from strong margins in Asian and U.S. markets, and we moved forward with expansion plans at our largest U.S. refin- eries. In Asia, we approved a major upgrade of the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea, the world’s fourth-largest refin- ery, to enable heavy oil processing. 
Our planned capital and exploratory spending pro- gram for 2006 is $14.8 billion, a 34 percent increase over 2005. This level of investment is aligned with our strong queue of growth projects and our commitment to bring new energy supplies to market. 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE The operating environ- ment for the energy industry continues to be challenging. With a sustained increase in global demand, tight supplies and a dynamic geopolitical situation, we continue to believe our industry is dealing with a fundamentally new energy equation. To some extent, risk in our industry has shifted from below ground – where Chevron has proved extremely effective at finding and producing hydrocarbons – to above ground, where challenges include access to resources, barriers to the free flow of capital investment to produce those resources and the economic develop- ment of infrastructure needed to connect energy supplies to markets. 
In this environment, the competitive advantage will go to companies that demonstrate sustained performance and operating excellence, apply new technology in ways that 
drive results, and create partnerships that enable the effi- cient execution of complex cross-border projects. These are all core capabilities of Chevron. 
HUMAN ENERGY: THE HEART OF CHEVRON Our success in 2005 was defined by a number of factors – robust strategies, consistent execution, a safety record that is among the best in our business, innovative technol- ogy and strong commodity prices. But the fundamental contributor to our success is the people of Chevron. Their dedication, resourcefulness and sheer ingenuity were on display throughout the year and were dramatically high- lighted in our response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Whether it was Chevron employees helping each other, assisting the community or working to restore energy supplies to the marketplace as quickly as they did, their actions were truly heroic. 
It is our people who develop our strategies, build our partnerships, create new technology, ensure that we oper- ate safely and ethically, and manage the great risks that are part of our business. It is this “human energy” that this year’s Annual Report celebrates. It is at the heart of Chevron. And it will continue to drive our mission to deliver safe, clean and reliable energy to fuel economic growth and human progress. 
Thank you for your continued support.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2006,"2006 was an exceptional year for our company. We continued to deliver value to our stockholders and to make strategic investments that will drive sustained, superior performance over the long term. We reported record net income of $17.1 billion on sales and other operating revenues of approximately $205 billion. For the year, total stockholder return was 33.8 percent, which was more than double the rate of return delivered by the S&P 500. Return on capital employed was a strong 22.6 percent. We continued to return cash to stockholders through our stock buyback program, purchasing $5 billion worth of shares in the open market, and we increased our annual dividend for the 19th year in a row. We are committed to exercising the capital discipline necessary to balance current returns with investments for future profi table growth. DELIVERING RESULTS :: We completed the successful integration of Unocal after acquiring the company in 2005 and reached a number of milestones for our major capital projects, including fi rst production at fi elds in Angola, Azerbaijan, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom. Overall, we increased year-over-year production volumes by nearly 6 percent. Our exploration program in 2006 was outstanding, refl ecting the discipline and effi ciency of our processes. We announced a number of discoveries, most notably in Australia, Nigeria and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We achieved our fi fth successful year of exploration results and added more than 1 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil and gas resources.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we completed the Jack well test, which set more than a half-dozen world records for pressure, depth and duration in the deep water. Jack clearly demonstrates the power of advanced technology to discover signifi cant new energy resources. Chevron is one of the largest leaseholders in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and is competitively positioned to benefi t as the long-term potential of this frontier area for crude oil and natural gas exploration plays out. In Australia, where we hold the leading natural gas resource position, signifi cant steps were made toward securing environmental regulatory approvals necessary for the development of the Greater Gorgon Area natural gas project. We also delivered the fi rst commissioning cargo of Australian liquefi ed natural gas to China aboard the Chevron-operated Northwest Swan vessel. Our global refi ning operations delivered record earnings in 2006, due in part to high reliability and utilization. We completed a major expansion at our Mississippi refi nery that increased gasoline production capacity by approximately 10 percent, and we acquired an interest in a large new export refi nery under construction in India, enhancing our presence in the fast-growing Asia-Pacifi c region. We set a new safety record in 2006, our fi fth consecutive year of improvement. However, we will never be satisfi ed until we reduce the number of safety-related incidents to zero. CHEVRON’S ENERGY PORTFOLIO :: We expect global demand for energy to continue growing. At the same time, increased competition for resources and heightened geopolitical risks are challenging customary supply growth options. In this kind of environment, energy portfolio diversifi cation is an increasingly important means for supplying consumers around the globe with affordable, reliable energy. Our current asset and investment portfolio is diverse. We have a strong queue of capital projects in progress, and our capital and exploratory budget for 2007 of $19.6 billion refl ects the concentrated development phases of many of these key projects. Our investments are focused on creating new legacy positions in key conventional energy basins, expanding our assets and capabilities in unconventional resources, and investing in emerging sources of energy such as gas-to-liquids and biofuels. This portfolio, with investments balanced by location, by energy source and by time to fi rst production, offers a strong foundation for sustained growth in even the most challenging of environments. HUMAN ENERGY :: At the center of our energy portfolio are the men and women of Chevron, our “human energy.” They run our operations safely, reliably and effi ciently, in even the toughest conditions. They develop technology that improves our operations today and creates new business opportunities for tomorrow. They ensure we contribute to a better quality of life in every community where we operate. The people of Chevron have a pioneering and ingenious spirit that enables the company to continue expanding the boundaries of energy. They understand the importance of energy to global economic growth and human progress, and they are committed to securing the energy the world needs in innovative and value-creating ways. I am proud to be part of the team.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2007,"To Our Stockholders 2007 was a year of significant achievement for our company. We reported record earnings, led our peer group in total stockholder return and advanced our robust queue of major capital projects, which are creating a strong foundation for long-term growth. Most important, the people of Chevron performed superbly, demonstrating the values and ingenuity that distinguish our company. Net income of $18.7 billion represented a fourth consecutive year of record earnings. Capital and exploratory expenditures for the year were $20 billion, and return on capital employed was 23.1 percent. We increased the annual dividend for the 20th consecutive year and achieved a total stockholder return of 30.5 percent, approximately 25 percentage points higher than the return delivered by the S&P 500. We continued to return cash to our stockholders through stock buyback programs, purchasing $7 billion of our common shares during 2007. In September, we initiated a new program to acquire up to $15 billion of our common shares over a period of up to three years. We are committed to the capital discipline necessary to create sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. Achieving Milestones In the upstream, we executed our strategy of managing our base business profitably while advancing new projects for future growth and returns. Our base business, which is our daily crude oil and natural gas production activities around the world, generates the cash to fund our long-term growth. We manage these assets with a strong focus on world-class reservoir management, improved recovery rates and continual innovation. Nowhere is this more evident than in California’s San Joaquin Valley, where the Kern River Field celebrated its 2 billionth barrel of production in late 2007. Kern River began production in 1899 and through the consistent application of innovative technology continues to be a world-class asset. Our exploration program, which is centered on high-impact prospects in key basins, had a highly successful year. We posted a 41 percent success rate, adding approximately 1 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil and natural gas resources. Major capital projects in the upstream reached several milestones. The Agbami floating production, storage and offloading vessel was completed and was positioned in the deep water off Nigeria in early 2008. In 2007, the Bibiyana gas field in Bangladesh began production, and we launched commercial production from the 110-megawatt Darajat III geothermal plant in Indonesia. Chevron’s track record as a successful partner helped us achieve a 10-year extension for producing natural gas in the Gulf of Thailand, which will help realize our goal of increasing production from this area to more than 1 billion cubic feet per day. Our expertise in producing sour gas at the Tengizchevroil project in Kazakhstan was a key factor in our selection as a partner by the China National Petroleum Corporation for the development of the Chuandongbei natural gas area in central China. Our global downstream operations continue to focus on increasing refinery flexibility, improving reliability and creating new business opportunities. We completed projects to increase the flexibility and capacity of two major refineries — in El Segundo, California, and at our 50 percent-owned Yeosu refinery complex in South Korea. The downstream business also enhanced its focus on profitable growth through the divestiture of several nonstrategic assets. Our 2007 safety performance showed significant improvement, but we will never be satisfied until we have reduced the number of safety-related incidents to zero. We are absolutely committed to achieving this goal. Enhancing Technology and Capability In the current business environment, companies with superior ability to source and deploy technology will build a sustainable competitive advantage
Our technology strategies are centered on delivering superior performance in our core businesses and establishing leading positions in emerging and transformational technologies. To that end, we opened two new Global Technology Centers — in Aberdeen, Scotland, and Perth, Australia — to expand our research and development capability. In addition, we created a number of strategic alliances with universities to conduct advanced research into new energy sources and processes. To build upon our organizational capability, in 2007 we restructured the upstream business into four operating companies — North America; AsiaPacific; Africa and Latin America; and Eurasia, Europe and Middle East. This new structure will strengthen our focus on long-term growth, enhance business partnerships, and drive more efficiency, standardization and collaboration across the organization. Human Energy and Ingenuity In 2007, we launched a new global advertising campaign, “The Power of Human Energy.” It focuses on the realities of energy today — the challenge of meeting rising demand as the global economy expands, together with the imperative to manage the impact of energy consumption on the environment. These are huge challenges. But as the campaign makes clear, human ingenuity will discover solutions as it has throughout history. The people of Chevron are working every day to apply the kind of ingenuity that will create responsible, practical and sustainable solutions to these challenges. Thank you for investing in our company. We look forward to another year of achievement as we continue to create value for our stockholders while working to meet the world’s growing demand for safe, reliable energy.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2008,"To Our Stockholders 
2008 was a momentous year for Chevron. We reported our fifth consecutive year of record earnings. We had exceptional success finding new sources of crude oil and natural gas. We started up five major capital projects, with more to follow. And as economic challenges gripped the world’s attention in the second half of the year, Chevron people addressed those challenges and focused on the long term — helping to ensure safe, diversified supplies of energy for decades to come. 
Net income of $23.9 billion rep- resented a 28.1 percent increase
over the previous year. Capital and exploratory expenditures for 2008 were $22.8 billion, and return on capital employed was 26.6 percent. For the 21st consecutive year, we increased our annual dividend payout. We continued to return cash to our stockholders through stock buyback programs, purchasing $8 billion of our common shares during 2008. In total stockholder return, we outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 19 percentage points. While our total stockholder return was negative 18.4 percent, our results stood out compared with the market and most peers, underscoring our strength and discipline. 
Our strategies focus on delivering value over time: In 2008, we advanced our queue of 40 major capital projects, each with a net Chevron share of investment exceed- ing $1 billion. We added 1.3 billion barrels of oil-equivalent proved 
reserves, replacing 146 percent of oil-equivalent production this year. We also significantly improved our operating reliability at our eight company-operated refineries. 
The people of Chevron managed these achievements while accom- plishing one more: 2008 was our safest year ever. We earned one of the best safety records in our indus- try, making our global operations four times safer than five years ago. 
Delivering Energy Now 
In the upstream, we brought proj- ects onstream that are as large as they are long-term. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we began production at our deepwater Blind Faith Field. In Kazakhstan, Tengizchevroil completed major expansion projects that nearly doubled production capacity from the giant Tengiz Field. In Indonesia, an expansion of our Duri Field 
started production. In Australia, our fifth liquefied natural gas proc- essing unit came onstream. And in Nigeria, our Agbami deepwater field celebrated first oil. 
The ability to efficiently produce over decades depends as much on strong partnerships as on operational and technical skills. In 2008, we extended our agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for 30 years to operate the Kingdom’s 50 percent crude 
oil and natural gas interests in the Partitioned Neutral Zone between the Kingdom and the State of Kuwait. 
To increase flexibility in refining the world’s full range of crude oils, we upgraded key refineries in 2008. Refineries in California, Mississippi and at our 50 percent-owned Yeosu Refinery in South Korea now trans- form lower-cost, heavier crude oils into premium-value products. These major upgrades also included facilities to improve long-term reliability. 
Running efficient, reliable operations also means anticipating the forces of nature. Last summer, Hurricanes Dolly, Gustav and Ike forced evacuations of our Gulf of Mexico operations three times. Securing and starting up opera- tions is complex; our people did it, maintaining perfect safety. They also provided needed fuel to emergency responders and the public. They are 
a dedicated team. 
Developing Energy for the Future 
Looking ahead, we’re investing for the future. Our plans focus on increas- ing reserves, boosting crude oil and natural gas production, and improving reliability and efficiency. 
In exploration, we’re focused on large and aggregated energy resources in key basins of the world. Discoveries eventually become long-term energy producers, and this year, three will begin production. Frade, offshore Brazil, is forecasted to start up in the first half of the year. The Gulf of 
Mexico’s Tahiti Field and Angola’s off- shore Tombua-Landana development should reach first oil in the second half of 2009. In the downstream, we plan to launch four new refinery proj- ects to further improve reliability and refining flexibility. 
Meeting the Energy Challenge 
These are just some of our efforts at 
Delivering Energy Now — Developing Energy for the Future, the theme of this Annual Report. 
As economies around the world search for solid ground, certain outcomes are inevitable: Worldwide demand for energy will rise over
the long term. Population growth, industrialization, urbanization and the developing world’s demand for rising living standards all but ensure that. 
Energy is not a luxury — it’s the foundation for economic growth. By investing in the future, we’re creating value not only for our stakeholders, 
but also we’re building economic prosperity around the globe. 
While times are challenging, the peo- ple of Chevron have their eyes fixed on the horizon. That’s where growth will take hold. And when it does, the world will need all the energy it can get. Human energy and ingenuity will deliver it — two resources the people of Chevron have in abundant supply. 
Thank you for investing in our company.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2009,"ToOur Stockholders 
Since Chevron was founded more than 130 years ago, crude oil, natural gas and other sources of energy have produced an unprecedented rise in living standards for billions of people. Over that time, our company has built an enduring legacy of industry leadership and value for investors while producing the energy that makes our quality of life possible. 
As your Chairman, I’m committed to building on that legacy. It’s
an honor to lead Chevron into a future where energy will continue to be a foundation for global economic growth. 
A company’s strategies — and the abilities, values and focus of its people — are tested in tough times. In 2009, the people of Chevron delivered strong results in the face of a global economic downturn and difficult industry conditions. 
We brought major capital projects online or to capacity and achieved industry- leading production growth. We made major new discoveries of crude oil
and natural gas and continued to grow our natural gas business. Employees aggressively managed costs, resulting in about a 15 percent decrease in operating expenses over 2008. And we accomplished all this while recording fewer workplace injuries than ever before. 
Our financial performance for 2009 contributed to a strong balance sheet and returns for investors. Total stockholder return — a critical measure of our performance — was No. 1 among our top competitors over the past five years. We increased our annual dividend in 2009 for the 22nd consecutive year. Net income in 2009 was $10.5 billion on sales and other operating revenues of $167 billion, reflecting lower prices from 2008 for crude oil and natural gas and lower sales margins and prices for refined products. Return on capital employed for the year was 10.6 percent. 
We advanced our upstream growth strategy by bringing world-class deepwater projects online, including Tahiti in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Tombua-Landana offshore Angola and Frade offshore Brazil. Our Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan and Agbami ramp-ups in Nigeria added significant production volumes. We also achieved impressive results managing our producing crude oil and natural gas assets to limit natural field declines. 
In 2009, we made strong progress toward our goal to build a high-impact, global natural gas business. Construction of the Escravos gas-to-liquids and Angola liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants continued. Offshore Western Australia, we gave the go-ahead for the massive Gorgon LNG project and achieved important commercial milestones for the Wheatstone LNG development. 
We added 1.1 billion barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing 112 percent of net oil-equivalent production in 2009. And we continue to build for our future: Our exploration expertise and applied technology resulted in a drilling success rate of 57 percent, one of the best in the industry. 
The economic environment was challenging for refining and marketing in 2009. To manage our refining and marketing businesses in this environment, we
are aggressively controlling costs. Our downstream and chemical businesses continued their strong focus on reliability and safety. Refineries continued to run at industry-leading levels of utilization. Restructuring in our lubricants and Oronite fuel additives businesses generated improved earnings. 
In 2009, we progressed our renewable energy strategy, which is focused on enhancing our geothermal energy business — the largest in the world — while building our energy efficiency business and developing nonfood biofuels. 
Chevron’s performance and growth are intrinsically linked with the communities where we operate. Our projects generate thousands of jobs and support for businesses big and small around the world. Our community engagement programs are strategic investments in the future of our communities, focusing on health, education and sustainable socioeconomic development. 
Chevron enters 2010 from a position of financial and operational strength, with solid potential for growth. Our $21.6 billion capital and exploratory budget for 2010 reflects our industry-leading queue of major capital projects that support future growth. Much of our 2010 spending will focus on large multiyear projects aligned with our upstream growth strategies, on improving our operating efficiency and reliability, and on aligning our downstream businesses with the strongest market opportunities. 
Chevron’s core strengths — starting with the talent, dedication and values
of our employees worldwide — position us to achieve growth while helping meet long-term global demand for energy. The values of The Chevron Way
— getting results the right way — guide us every day. We operate with the highest standards of integrity and respect for human rights. We are deeply committed to safe and efficient operations and to conducting our business in an environmentally sound manner. We build strong partnerships to produce energy and support communities. 
Chevron’s future holds great promise. We have world-class assets, strong market positions and an industry-leading queue of projects and opportunities. We have robust long-term strategies and a proven ability to deliver results. We have unassailable ethics and a culture that attracts and develops the best talent. Chevron’s vision remains constant: to be the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. 
Our world grows more complex every day. We face increased challenges — geopolitical, environmental, regulatory and technical. But Chevron employees have risen to challenges for more than 130 years — with dedication, ingenuity and hard work. And I’m confident we will continue to do so. 
"
Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2010,"2010 was an outstanding year for Chevron. Once again
our people delivered strong results in a challenging environment. We made significant advances in our queue
of major capital projects, exceeded our goals for production growth, restructured our downstream business to enhance competitive performance and maintained our long-term leadership in total stockholder return. 
The company’s performance was grounded in a strong safety culture, which resulted in our safest year ever. The Macondo incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico underscored that safe operations are fundamental to our ability to operate. Following Macondo, we led the industry in working with regulators to enhance operating standards in the Gulf. We remain vigilant about safety, reliability and environmental stewardship wherever we operate. 
Our financial performance in 2010 contributed to a very strong balance sheet and competitive returns for investors. Net income in 2010 was $19 billion on sales and other operating revenues of $198 billion. We increased our annual dividend in 2010 for the 23rd consecutive year, initiated a stock repurchase program and maintained leadership in two key measures of financial perform- ance. Return on capital employed was 17.4 percent — a direct outcome of disciplined capital investment — and the company led our major competitors 
in total stockholder return over the past five years. 
Our upstream business continues to deliver major capital projects from our industry-leading queue. Tahiti, our world-class deepwater project in the Gulf
of Mexico, marked the first full year of production, and we continued ramp-ups of several new projects, including Frade in Brazil, Tombua-Landana in Angola and our Tengizchevroil joint venture in Kazakhstan. In 2010, total net oil- equivalent production in our upstream business increased 2 percent over 2009, after increasing 7 percent the previous year. We continued to build for future growth by sanctioning development of four large deepwater projects — Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot and Tahiti 2 in the Gulf of Mexico, and Papa-Terra in Brazil. 
We also continued building a high-impact natural gas business, most notably in Australia with two world-class liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone. Construction of the Gorgon facility on Barrow Island progressed toward 2014 startup while Wheatstone engineering work continued. A majority of our equity natural gas resources in both Gorgon and Wheatstone has been 
Commited under long-term LNG sales contracts. Almost half of our natural gas portfolio is located in the Asia-Pacific region, positioning us as a long-term supplier to growing Asian markets. 
Our exploration and business develop- ment programs created significant growth opportunities in 2010. We added new resource opportunities in China, Liberia, the Black Sea, eastern Europe and Canada. In addition, we acquired Atlas Energy in February 2011 to develop shale gas reserves in the prolific U.S. Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, bringing our total acreage additions since late 2009 to 14 million acres. 
In our downstream business, we responded to challenging market conditions by restructuring to achieve sustained improvement in competitive performance. We concluded sales of nonstrategic assets and implemented
a leaner, more focused and lower-cost downstream organization. We started
up projects at our refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, our affiliate refinery in South Korea, and at a chemicals facility in Qatar. 
Chevron enters 2011 with a $26 billion capital and exploratory budget — a 19 percent increase over 2010 levels and a reflection of our financial strength and unparalleled growth opportunities. Our spending will focus largely on executing upstream crude oil and natural gas exploration and production projects worldwide. Downstream spending will focus on increasing refinery flexibility, product yields and energy efficiency. 
At Chevron, technology is directly linked to creating value for our stockholders. Some key focus areas 
include our i-field TM 
program, which applies information technology to 
TM 
improve production from mature fields; enhanced heavy oil recovery through advanced steamflood and thermal management; and implementation 
of our next-generation reservoir simulation technology. 
Technological innovation underpins
our renewable energy strategy. We
are investing in research projects
with industry and university partners
to explore promising pathways for renewables that may have the potential to be developed profitably at commercial scale. Our energy efficiency business, Chevron Energy Solutions, continues 
to apply advanced solar and other energy-saving technologies to lower costs for institutional customers. We also are exploring growth opportunities to develop new geothermal prospects in Indonesia and the Philippines. 
In addition to operating capabilities,
our success going forward is tied to
the partnerships we build with our host communities. We focus our community partnerships and investments in three areas — health, education and economic development. We believe these areas are among the most promising avenues for creating mutual benefits for communities and our company. In 2010, we deployed approximately $180 million in community investments worldwide. Notable among our partnerships in 2010 was the 
launch of the Niger Delta Partnership Initiative, an innovative and multipartner approach to support sustained economic development and conflict resolution in the Niger Delta region. These types of 
social investments reflect our belief that our success as a business is tied directly to the economic vitality and health of the communities where we operate. 
In 2010, we enhanced our core busi- ness strategies with three enterprise strategies: People, Execution and Growth. We are focused on recruiting and developing the best people in the business, flawlessly executing our projects and developing opportunities that will create long-term growth for the company. Above all else, the men and women of Chevron will continue to be guided by our company’s values — getting results the right way — and our vision 
to be the company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. 
I am confident that as we continue
to produce the energy required for economic growth and human progress, our enduring values and proven strategies will continue to benefit
our stockholders, our employees, our business partners and our communities. 
Thank you for investing in Chevron.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2011,"To Our Stockholders 
Chevron delivered outstanding financial and operating results in 2011. Even during turbulent economic times, we achieved record earnings, advanced our industry-leading queue of major capital projects to sustain long-term production growth and largely completed the global restructuring of our downstream business. And Chevron once again delivered superior returns for our stockholders. 2011 was a record year for our financial performance. Net income was $26.9 billion on sales and other operating revenues of $244.4 billion, 
and we delivered a strongly competi- tive 21.6 percent return on capital employed. We raised our dividend twice in 2011, marking the 24th consecutive year of increases. 
We generated a total stockholder return of 20.3 percent, leading our peer group in 2011 and over the past five- and 10-year periods. 
Our financial performance reflected outstanding operating results. In the upstream, we ranked No. 1 in earnings per barrel relative to our 
peers. We began initial production of the Platong II natural gas project in Thailand. The Angola liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and Usan deepwater development offshore Nigeria are expected to begin production in 2012. Big Foot and Jack/St. Malo in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are on schedule to come online in 2014. We also advanced 
our two world-class LNG projects in Western Australia. Gorgon achieved key construction milestones and is on track for a 2014 startup, and we broke ground on Wheatstone, with a planned startup in 2016. 
We expanded our strategic position in natural gas in North America and Europe. Notably in 2011, we closed our acquisition of Atlas Energy in the northeastern United States, drilled our first shale gas wells in Poland and Canada, and completed an agreement to assess shale opportunities in southern China. 
We continued to build on our explo- ration success in 2011. The success rate of our exploration wells was nearly 70 percent, exceeding our 10-year average, which is among the best in our peer group. We added crude oil and natural gas resources through discoveries in six countries and added 1.7 billion barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing 171 percent of production in 2011. 
In our global downstream and chemicals business, we ranked No. 1 in earnings per barrel in 2011, reflecting a strategic focus on reshaping our global portfolio to improve efficiency, enhance market focus and grow returns. We also ranked No. 1 in refinery utilization for the third straight biennial Solomon Associates refinery benchmark study. We advanced work on our Pascagoula Base Oil Plant that, when completed in 2013, will make us the world’s leading supplier 
of premium base oil. We also made progress on the expansion of our Oronite additives plant in Singapore. 
Underpinning our operations is a focus on developing new technologies that create business value and competitive advantage. We advanced a breakthrough dual-gradient drilling technology to improve access to deepwater assets and elevate deepwater drilling safety and environmental standards that is 
on track for initial deployment on the 
Big Foot project in 2012. In the Partitioned Zone, between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, we progressed a pilot project to enhance production of heavy oil through industry-leading steamflood technology, building on our success in Indonesia and the San Joaquin Valley in California. We continue to pursue a variety of next-generation technologies with partners that include businesses, universities and national laboratories. 
Over the past decade, we’ve gone
from trailing the industry in safety
to becoming one of its leaders as a result of our broader commitment to operational excellence — the safety
of our people, the reliability of our operations and environmental stewardship. To achieve our goal of zero incidents, we have deployed systems and processes that helped drive down injury rates to industry- leading levels. We take pride in what we’ve achieved, but we expect continual improvement in how we manage risk. Even with this emphasis, we are not incident-free. We rigorously investigate all incidents to strengthen our ability to recognize and reduce risk and achieve what we strive for — doing things the right way every time. I am committed to meeting our world-class standards in safety and operational excellence, and I know that the men and women of Chevron join me in that commitment. 
Meeting the world’s long-term demand for energy requires significant invest- ments. We move into 2012 with a $32.7 billion capital and exploratory budget. This reflects our confidence in an unparalleled project queue and is supported by our strong financial position and operational performance. 
Also important to our future are
the investments we make in the communities where we operate. Our business generates immense value
by creating jobs and supporting local business development. We also make strategic social investments focused on building stronger communities through partnerships in the areas of health, education and economic development. One of our larger social investments in 2011 was a $20 million commitment to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Angola, Nigeria and South Africa. All told, we deployed nearly 
$1 billion in worldwide community investments over the past six years. I encourage you to read more about these investments in our companion publication, the 2011 Corporate Responsibility Report. 
Affordable energy underpins economies and generates progress and prosperity. The people of Chevron remain focused on finding and producing affordable energy safely, reliably and efficiently. This is a responsibility that our company takes seriously. We are committed to growing our business, contributing to global economic expansion, building stronger communities and creating enduring value for our stockholders.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2012,"To Our Stockholders 
For Chevron, 2012 was another year of delivering strong results. Even as global economic challenges persisted, we continued building the foundation for sustained growth in our upstream and downstream businesses. And we produced excellent returns for our stockholders. 
Our strong financial performance was reflected in net income of $26.2 billion on sales and other operating revenues of $231 billion. We achieved a competitive 18.7 percent return on capital employed. We increased our dividend payout to stockholders for the 25th consecutive year, marking an 
average dividend increase of 1 1 percent compounded since 2004 — compared with the average 3 percent of S&P
100 companies over that same period. Our total stockholder returns of 6.5 percent and 16.3 percent over the past five- and 10-year periods, respectively, continue to lead our peer group. 
Our major businesses generated strong operating results. In the upstream,
we ranked No. 1 in earnings per barrel relative to our peers for the third straight year. In 2012, we advanced four deepwater major capital projects through startup: Usan, Caesar/Tonga, Agbami 2 and Tahiti 2 — with Tahiti setting several industry records for water injection in deepwater production. Over the next five years, we anticipate 16 project startups with a Chevron share of investment greater than 
$1 billion each. Among them are two
of our three new liquefied natural gas projects: Angola and Gorgon, offshore Western Australia; our deepwater projects Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot and Tubular Bells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; and the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids Project in Nigeria. 
Exploration successes continued in 2012 with discoveries in seven countries. That includes Australia’s Carnarvon Basin, bringing total discoveries there to 19 since mid- 2009 and positioning our Gorgon
and Wheatstone projects for potential future expansions. Exploration success was nearly 74 percent, exceeding our 10-year average of 54 percent. We added 1.1 billion barrels of net oil- equivalent proved reserves, replacing 112 percent of production in 2012. 
The global restructuring of our downstream and chemicals business has delivered greater value from a more focused footprint. In 2012, we ranked No. 2 in earnings per barrel relative to our peer group. Construction of a lubricants facility at our Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery is progressing toward completion by year-end 2013 and is expected to make Chevron the world’s largest producer of premium base oil. We are on track to capture $1 billion in annual refinery profit improvements, compared with 2008, through measures including improved product yields and energy efficiency. 
Our 2013 capital and exploratory budget of $36.7 billion, combined with our strong financial position, supports our long-term growth strategy. This record level of capital spending reflects our unmatched project queue, as well as confidence
in our competitive advantages and organizational capability. It keeps us on target to reach our production goal of 3.3 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day by 2017, an increase of more than 20 percent from 2010 levels. 
To continually improve our operations, we develop technologies that advance our business and create new value. These include technologies in areas such as seismic imaging, deepwater operations and hydrocarbons from shale that enable us to access new resources while also ensuring safe and responsible production. At the Marcellus Shale operations in western Pennsylvania, water recycling technology has reduced our fresh water consumption. To further reduce our operating footprint, temporary modular tanks are being tested for onsite water storage. At our St. Malo well, a series of field trials points to the promise of a new system designed to boost well completion efficiency, thus reducing rig time, costs and operational risk. 
Fundamental to everything we do
is a constant focus on achieving increasingly higher levels of safety, operational and environmental performance. Our efforts are guided by our Operational Excellence 
Management System, which aligns with international standards for safety and environmental performance. In 2012, we continued to be an industry leader in personal safety, as measured by injuries requiring time away from work. We also delivered our lowest spill volumes in a decade. But we are not incident-free. Our strong safety culture and our focused efforts in improving process safety will help
us continually progress toward our goal of incident-free operations. 
We apply the same type of commit- ment to our social performance, contributing to the creation of stronger communities wherever we operate. 
We work toward building sustainable economies by employing people
from our host communities, training workers to world-class standards, building capacity and supporting small business. In 2012, we bought $60 billion in goods and services around the globe, providing a meaningful stimulus for local economies. And in the past seven years, we invested more than $1 billion worldwide in programs focused on economic development, health and education. You can find more detail about our social investments in our companion publication, the 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report. 
Our commitment above all is to safely develop the affordable energy vital
to economic growth. In fulfilling that commitment, we are mindful of our unique responsibility as an ambassador for a system of values — The Chevron Way — that promotes responsible and ethical behavior in all we do. We have the right people with the right skills, an unparalleled project portfolio, proven strategies and a culture committed to being the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership 
and performance. We are strongly positioned to create enduring value for the communities where we operate and for those who place their trust in us — our stockholders.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2013,"To Our Stockholders 
Chevron delivered solid financial and operating results in 2013 while advancing our industry-leading queue of major capital projects. Our sound financial performance was reflected in net income of $21.4 billion on sales and other operating revenues of $220 billion. We achieved a competitive 13.5 percent return on capital employed. And for the 26th consecutive year, we increased our annual dividend payout to stockholders. Our total stockholder returns of just under 15 percent over the past five- and 10-year periods continue to lead our peer group. 
Throughout 2013 our major businesses generated strong operating results. In the upstream, we ranked No. 1 in earnings per barrel relative to our peers for the fourth continuous
year. We began production at the Angola liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and achieved first oil from the Papa-Terra project offshore Brazil. In 2013 we also advanced our two world-class LNG projects in Western Australia. Construction at Gorgon
is approximately 75 percent complete, and construction at Wheatstone is approximately 25 percent complete. Over the next four years we anticipate 15 project startups with a Chevron investment of more than $1 billion each, including two key deepwater projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico — Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot, which are expected to come online in 2014 and 2015, respectively. 
We continued to add resources to our portfolio through both exploration and targeted acquisitions in 2013. The success rate of our exploration wells was nearly 59 percent, and we added crude oil and natural gas resources through discoveries in 10 countries. We grew our portfolio of opportunities with a new operating interest in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, new acreage in the Bight Basin offshore South Australia, and finalized agreements to pursue unconventional resources in Argentina as well as assume full operatorship of the Kitimat LNG plant and Pacific Trail Pipeline in Canada. We also successfully completed the first phase of our Duvernay Shale program in Canada. We added approximately 800 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing almost 85 percent of production in 2013. The company’s three-year average reserve replacement ratio is 123 percent of net oil-equivalent production. 
In downstream and chemicals,
we continued to benefit from the investments we have made in
our refining system and from our competitive position in additives, petrochemicals and lubricants. In 2013 we ranked No.2 in earnings
per barrel relative to our peer group. And we neared completion on the construction of our Pascagoula Base Oil Plant, which will position us as the world’s leading supplier of premium base oil when it starts up in 2014.
We also reached final investment decision on Chevron Phillips Chemical Company’s (CPChem) U.S. Gulf Coast ethylene cracker and derivatives unit. These projects allow CPChem to take advantage of the growth in U.S. shale gas and associated ethane. 
Delivering results the right way is a responsibility that our company takes seriously. Our Operational Excellence Management System guides us as we seek to achieve increasingly higher levels of safety, operational and environmental performance. This focus helped us deliver our lowest number on record of serious process safety-related loss-of-containment events and liquid spills. In 2013 we continued to be a leader in personal safety as measured by injuries requiring time away from work. 
Despite statistically strong safety performance, we are not yet incident- free. In 2013 we undertook extensive actions to enhance process safety to prevent serious incidents. Chevron is deeply committed to our goal of zero incidents and achieving world-class performance in all measures of safety. 
Meeting the world’s long-term
demand for energy requires significant investment. We enter 2014 with a capital and exploratory budget of $39.8 billion. This reflects the company’s confidence in our unparalleled queue of projects that will help us deliver valuable growth. Chevron’s capital investments enable us to grow our production while continuing to deliver industry-leading 
performance. We anticipate that
2014 will be the peak year for spending on our Australian LNG projects as we move them closer to first production. Overall, our long-term production growth outlook is compelling, and we are investing today in projects that
will deliver production, cash flow and earnings growth to the end of the decade. 
Chevron’s business success is deeply linked to society’s progress. We partner with governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to build beneficial and enduring relationships, manage the impacts of our operations, 
and invest in programs to create measurable and lasting value. Our business and social investments boost local economies by creating jobs, improving livelihoods and supporting local businesses. Beyond direct business investment and taxes, over the past eight years we contributed almost $1.5 billion to local communities through social investments that foster economic growth, with a significant focus on health, education and economic development programs. You can find more information in our 2013 Corporate Responsibility Report. 
The men and women of Chevron
are committed to our vision of being the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership
and performance. We remain
focused on finding and producing the affordable, reliable energy that drives global economic growth and human prosperity. And due to our unparalleled project portfolio and proven business strategies, I am confident that we are strongly positioned to contribute to these aspirations, as well as create enduring value for our stockholders. 
"
Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2014,"To Our Stockholders 
For Chevron 2014 was a
year of moving forward our strong queue of projects. Even as we experienced a
50 percent drop in the price of oil in the second half of the year, we maintained our focus on providing affordable and reliable energy, safely and responsibly, to the benefit
of our stakeholders. 
Financially we had a solid year
as reflected in our net income of
$19.2 billion on sales and other operating revenues of $200.5 billion. We achieved a 10.9 percent return on capital employed. 2014 represented the 27th consecutive year of annual dividend payout increases, underlining that our commitment to the dividend is our highest financial priority. In 2014 we launched our three-year $10 billion divestment program, obtaining $5.7 billion in asset sales during the first year. Finally, although market returns were challenged in 2014 our annualized total stockholder returns of 1 1.5 and
1 1.4 percent over the past five- and 10-year periods, respectively, continued to lead our peer group. 
In the upstream we ranked No. 1 in earnings per barrel relative to our peers for the fifth straight year. We
are targeting production of 3.1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2017, a 20 percent increase from 2014, which is a larger growth rate than that projected for our large competitors. 
In early December Jack/St. Malo, one of our deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico projects, delivered first oil on time and within budget. In 2015 we’ll 
Also see additional production from ramp-ups at Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bibiyana expansion in Bangladesh and our Escravos gas-to- liquids facility in Nigeria, all of which started up in 2014. We also expect the startup in 2015 of our Gorgon liquefied natural gas project offshore Western Australia, and we will ramp up production from our Permian Basin assets in the United States. 
In exploration we’re positioning ourselves for growth. We had a successful year in 2014, including two significant Gulf of Mexico discoveries in the deep water — Guadalupe and Anchor — as well as promising discoveries in Australia, Canada and the Permian Basin. 
In downstream and chemicals we ranked No. 1 in earnings per barrel relative to our peers. We are benefiting from improved reliability and targeted growth efforts. We made reliability investments at several refineries, including in El Segundo, California, and Salt Lake City, Utah. We started up the Pascagoula, Mississippi, base oil facility this year, making Chevron the world’s largest premium base 
oil producer. Oronite completed a major expansion in Singapore, which, when combined with earlier growth initiatives, doubled the plant’s original additives production capacity. Chevron Phillips Chemical, our joint venture, started up a new 1-hexene plant in Texas, where it also broke ground
on a new ethane cracker and two polyethylene facilities. 
We enter 2015 with the financial strength to meet the challenges of a volatile crude oil price environment. We have significant efforts underway to manage to a lower cost structure and capital spend rate. We announced a 2015 capital and exploratory budget of $35 billion. The 2015 budget is 13 percent lower than total investments for 2014, reflecting our focus on being more selective with our investments in the current lower-price environment. 
We remain committed to delivering world-class safety, operational and environmental performance in our businesses. In 2014 we delivered our best overall year in personal safety, as measured by recordable injuries and injuries requiring time away taxes, we will continue strategic social investments. Over the past nine years we have contributed approximately $1.7 billion in social investments, with a special focus on three core areas — health, education and economic development — to develop skilled workers, improve access to health care, and boost local and regional economies. More details about these investments are available in the 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report. 
As always, The Chevron Way provides a roadmap for how we conduct our business, setting our vision to be
the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. It establishes 
the values by which we deliver our results, including acting with integrity, promoting diversity, and protecting people and the environment. By following The Chevron Way we will continue to create enduring value for the communities where we operate and for our stockholders. 
The progress we made this past year is due to the hard work and determination of our workforce. All of us at Chevron are committed to excellence in everything we do. The end result is 
the strong performance we delivered in 2014. 

from work, and in process safety
as measured by loss of containment incidents. We also had record lows
in our process fires, petroleum spill volume and motor vehicle crash rate. In the last decade our Days Away From Work Rate has declined by
83 percent, our Total Recordable Incident Rate has improved by 55 percent, and our Motor Vehicle Crash Rate has declined by 50 percent. 
We are just as determined to maintain our strong social performance, recognizing that healthy businesses require healthy communities. We 
will continue to invest in projects
and local goods and services, create jobs, and generate revenues for the communities in which we work. Beyon 
"
Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2015,"Low commodity prices made 2015 a challenging year for Chevron and the entire oil and natural gas industry, reducing earnings across the sector. 
Our full-year 2015 net income was $4.6 billion, down from $19.2 billion in 2014. Our sales and other operating revenue were
$129.9 billion, down from $200.5 billion 
in 2014. We achieved a 2.5 percent return on capital employed versus the 10.9 percent achieved in 2014. 
In light of difficult market conditions, we took significant actions to reduce costs and improve net cash flow. We reduced capital and operating expenses by $9 billion through renegotiating contracts with vendors and suppliers, streamlining organizations to reduce our employee and contractor work- force, deferring and canceling projects not economic at low prices, and selling $6 billion in nonstrategic and other assets. 
We had a number of notable accomplish- ments during 2015. Our Upstream business, which is responsible for exploration and production, increased worldwide net oil-equivalent production by 2 percent, to 2.6 million barrels per day. We started up the Lianzi Field, located in a unitized offshore zone between the Republic of Congo and Angola; Moho Nord, our deepwater devel- opment offshore the Republic of Congo; Agbami 3, off the coast of the central 
Niger Delta region; and Chuandongbei,
our natural gas field in southwest China, which initiated production in early 2016.
In addition we ramped up Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Also significant progress was achieved on our major capital projects, including Gorgon, our largest Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, and Wheatstone LNG as they move toward start-up in 2016 and mid-2017, respectively. 
We added approximately 1 billion barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2015. These additions equate to approximately 107 percent of net oil-equivalent production for the year. Significant reserves were added from the Permian Basin in the United States and the Wheatstone Project in Australia. In our exploration program, we success- fully drilled an appraisal well of our Anchor discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 
Our Downstream and Chemicals business, which is responsible for our refining, marketing and chemical manufacturing, had an outstanding year. This business 
maintained reliable operations, benefited from lower feedstock costs and realized efficiencies gained by the reshaping of our portfolio in recent years. 
2015 was one of our best years in overall health, environment and safety performance and our best year ever in preventing significant incidents. Our Days Away From Work Rate and Motor Vehicle Crash Rate set new record lows, and our Total Recordable Incident Rate and petroleum spill volume matched last year’s record lows. 
We also continued our support of the communities in which we work. This past year we advanced our strategic programs and partnerships, with more than $233 million in global social 
investments. We focused these invest- ments in three core areas — health, education and economic development — to improve access to health care, develop skilled workers, and boost local and regional economies. These social invest- ments complement our investments in projects and local goods and services, creating jobs and generating revenues for the communities where we operate. More details are available in the 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report. 
I am proud to note that 2015 marked the 28th consecutive year that we increased the annual per-share dividend payout. Our top financial priority remains 
maintaining and growing the dividend as the pattern of earnings, cash flow and balance sheet strength permits. Our year-end debt ratio was a comfort- able 20.2 percent. 
Looking ahead, we announced a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $26.6 billion, which is 22 percent lower than our expenditures for 2015 and 
34 percent lower than 2014. This capital budget will enable us to complete and ramp up projects under construction, fund high-return, short-cycle invest- ments, preserve options for viable long-cycle projects, and ensure safe, reliable operations. 
The focus of the enterprise in 2016 will remain on our five key priorities — safely 
starting up projects under construction and realizing the cash flow from them, lowering capital spending, reducing operating expenses, completing our divestment program for assets that have greater value to others than to 
us, and doing all this while continuing to operate safely and reliably. 
Our company’s products provide the energy that is critical for economic progress. We are well positioned to meet growing demand in a safe and responsible manner. 
In all we do, we are guided by The Chevron Way. This roadmap underpins the character of our company and establishes the values by which we deliver our results. I am confident that our company and our employees have what it takes to meet the challenges of the current business environment and achieve our vision of being the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. 
Thank you for your confidence and your investment in Chevron.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2016,"Low commodity prices in 2016 reduced earnings across the industry and reinforced the need for structural reform. With Brent averaging $44 per barrel, Chevron reported a loss of $497 million compared with earnings of $4.6 billion in 2015. It was a year of transition, and Chevron took significant actions to reduce costs and improve net cash flow to ensure our competitiveness in any operating environment. 
Our 2016 priorities were to finish projects under construction; reduce capital spending; reduce operating expenses; complete asset sales; and operate safely and reliably. We made substantial progress (see graphic, Page 4) on these priorities as we worked toward our goal of becoming cash balanced and able to pay the dividend from free cash flow in 2017. 
The actions we took included thousands of initiatives across the enterprise to prioritize investments, negotiate better rates from vendors and suppliers, and improve drilling and other efficiencies. All of these actions enabled us to increase our annual per-share dividend payout for the 29th consecutive 
year. Our total stockholder returns outpaced our major competitors by a wide margin last year. In fact, we’re No. 1 in total stockholder return relative to our peers for any cumulative holding period going back 25 years. Our year-end debt ratio was 24 percent. 
Operationally, we met a number of milestones, including startup at our Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project. Gorgon is one of the world’s largest LNG projects, and we expect it to be a significant revenue source for decades.
We also achieved startup at Alder in the U.K. North Sea. We brought on line all three trains at the Chuandongbei Project in China. We restarted the Angola LNG project. We achieved natural gas production from the Bangka Field Development Project in Indonesia. And finally, we ramped up our 
Jack/St. Malo deepwater project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Our Upstream business, responsible for exploration and production, reported worldwide net production of 2.6 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day. Production increases
were offset by asset sales, normal field declines and 
maintenance-related downtime. We added approximately 1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BBOE) of proved reserves in 2016 before asset sales. These equate to approximately 108 percent of net oil-equivalent production for the year. After asset sales, we replaced approximately 95 percent
of production. In our exploration program, we added approximately 1.4 BBOE to our resource base. 
Our Downstream and Chemicals business, which is responsible for our refining, marketing and chemical manufacturing, achieved its highest refinery utilization in more than 10 years. We also progressed a number of strategic initiatives. For example, we closed the sale of our Hawaii refining and marketing business. We sanctioned the Salt Lake refinery’s alkylation retrofit project using technology we developed to improve the efficiency and safety of this process – technology that we will license to others. We also progressed work on our $6 billion joint-venture U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which includes a world-scale ethane cracker and polyethylene units, targeted for initial production in 2017. 
Midstream and Development secured additional LNG
sales commitments for delivery from Australia, despite the challenging market environment. In addition, we made good progress toward scheduled delivery of the fifth and sixth LNG carriers in 2017, to complete the largest shipbuilding program in our history. 
Our 2016 health, environment and safety performance set or matched record lows in many of our core safety metrics. We continue to focus on eliminating high-consequence personal and process safety incidents. We also continued our social investments. In 2016, we invested $186 million 
in global partnerships and programs, complementing our investments in projects and local goods and services that created jobs and generated revenues for the communities where we operate. More details are available in the 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report. 
Going forward, we’re committed to continuing to improve free cash flow and returns by focusing on investments that are economic with lower prices and by controlling our capital program. We announced a 2017 capital and exploratory budget of $19.8 billion – 42 percent less than what we spent in 2015 and approximately 12 percent lower than 2016 capital and exploratory investments. 
In 2017, we expect Wheatstone, our next major Australian LNG project, to start up and the Mafumeira Sul project in 
Angola to achieve first oil. In Kazakhstan, our 50 percent- owned affiliate, Tengizchevroil, will be working on a project expected to increase its total production to approximately
1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day. First oil is planned for 2022. In the Permian Basin, we will continue to focus on shale and tight resource development, capitalizing on efficiencies we’ve already demonstrated in our drilling program there. 
I am optimistic about the future. Our products are responsible for the greatest advancements in living standards in recorded history. Energy demand remains strong, and we expect the need for oil and natural gas to continue to grow over the next 20-plus years as the developing world reaches for a better quality of life. 
As we work to provide the energy the world needs, we will continue to be guided by The Chevron Way (www.chevron. com/thechevronway), our roadmap for enabling human progress as the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. In 2016, we refined our business strategies to address the changing operating environment. We are focused on improving returns on all our assets. We maintained our workforce development programs and university hiring to ensure we have the talented workforce we need in order to deliver these strategies. 
I am confident Chevron will remain competitive and at
the forefront of an industry that provides the reliable and affordable energy necessary for global economic growth. Thank you for your interest and investment in the company.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2017,"The contributions of the energy industry to economic development have enabled the greatest advancements in living standards in recorded history. Over the course of nearly 140 years, Chevron has become a leader in helping improve the communities we touch – reducing energy poverty, driving economic and social development, improving health and education, delivering the benefits of modern life, and working to advance human progress for billions around the world, in developed and developing countries alike. Our leadership is a profound source of pride. We take seriously our responsibility to answer the call of those who aspire to a better today – even as we continuously innovate to solve the energy challenges of tomorrow. That is why we are anchored to, and guided by, the vision, values and strategies of The Chevron Way. We strive to operate as the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. We are committed to business and enterprise strategies that enhance our ability to deliver industry-leading results and superior stockholder value in any business environment. And most important, we are united by our purpose: enabling human progress by developing the energy that improves lives and powers the world forward.
Delivering on our purpose requires relationships built upon trust and integrity throughout the world. So just as important as what we do is how we do it, through ethical and responsible actions that support and protect our workforce, our stakeholders, the communities where we operate and the environment, while delivering lasting and sustainable value to our stockholders. This is our definition of leading the right way. The responsible way. The Chevron Way. (See pages 86 and 87.)
At the heart of Chevron are a dedicated, innovative and talented global workforce and a Board of Directors that is engaged with leadership to oversee strategic decisions and to manage the wide array of risks inherent to our business.
In 2017, the world economy grew at its quickest pace in nearly five years, providing strong support to oil and gas demand. The combination of healthy demand growth and OPEC production cuts reduced the surplus in global oil markets, and China’s actions to reduce air pollution and curb coal use supported demand in liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets. Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions throughout the world added uncertainty to markets, with ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, continued strain in the Middle East and challenging economic conditions across oil exporting economies. The U.S. Congress passed the first comprehensive tax reform legislation in decades and began work on regulatory reform, providing renewed optimism for the U.S. economy. Overall, oil and gas market conditions improved in 2017, and hydrocarbons are projected to play an important role in fueling the world economy for decades to come. Chevron’s actions to bring on line new production from the Permian Basin in the United States and from our major capital projects in Australia helped meet growing global demand in 2017 and supported our aim of being a reliable supplier of the affordable energy the world needs in order to prosper. During the downturn in commodity prices that began in 2014, we adjusted to challenging conditions, and in 2017, we delivered on our commitments to generate winning performance in any price environment. A key objective for 2017 was to become cash neutral – balance cash coming in and cash going out – in an environment of lower commodity prices. Full-year cash flow from operations was $20.5 billion, and we were cash balanced without asset sales. This momentum continues as we move into 2018.
In 2017, we improved returns by further reducing expenses and by generating increased revenues as we brought projects on line. At the same time, our capital spending continued to shift toward shorter-cycle, high-return investments in unconventional oil and gas. We continued to unlock value from our industry-leading portfolio of opportunities, including legacy positions in Australia, Kazakhstan and the Permian Basin. We captured the benefits of being an integrated energy company with strong earnings, cash flow and returns from our Downstream & Chemicals business. Our full-year 2017 net income was $9.2 billion, up $9.7 billion from a loss in 2016. Our sales and other operating revenue was $134.7 billion, up $24.5 billion from 2016. We achieved a 5.0 percent return on capital employed.
Chevron’s first financial priority is maintaining and growing the dividend when we can sustainably support the increase with cash flow and earnings. In 2017, our annual per-share dividend payout increased for the 30th consecutive year. We also strengthened our balance sheet – our year-end debt ratio was 20.7 percent, down from 24.1 percent at year-end 2016. Our performance reflected the actions we took to ensure our competitiveness in any operating environment. Our priorities were to complete and start up projects under construction, reduce capital spending and operating expenses, selectively sell assets, and operate safely and reliably. In 2017, we met those priorities. We finished construction of key major capital projects. We reduced capital spending to $18.8 billion from $22.4 billion in 2016. Since 2013, we’ve reduced our capital spending from a peak of $41.9 billion. We also lowered operating expenses by $1.1 billion from 2016. We met our 2016–2017 target for asset sales, receiving total proceeds of $8 billion. And our steadfast commitment to eliminate high-consequence incidents continued. In 2017, our Upstream business reported worldwide net production of 2.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up more than 5 percent from 2016. We added approximately 1.54 billion barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing approximately 155 percent of production. In Australia, we continued to ramp up LNG production by bringing on line Gorgon Train 3 and Wheatstone Train 1. We ramped up production at Gorgon Trains 1 and 2 and at Jack/St. Malo in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Hebron Project, our nonoperated joint venture in Canada, started production in 2017. In Kazakhstan, 
we continued construction on the Future Growth Project and Wellhead Pressure Management Project. Production from our shale and tight rock activity in the Permian Basin exceeded expectations, driven by innovations in well design, applications of new technology, continued improvement in well drilling and completions, and an increase in long-lateral well inventory through optimization of our land position. Chevron’s 2017 results reflected strong performance from our Downstream & Chemicals business. In keeping with our strategic growth plans, we entered the retail fuel market in Mexico. Our joint venture Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. reached important milestones at its major U.S. Gulf Coast expansion, helping meet increased global petrochemicals demand and supporting our growth strategy. Chevron Oronite’s Singapore plant completed its carboxylate project, which will double worldwide production capacity of this important lubricant additive. The modernization project at our Richmond Refinery, in California, met its construction milestones for the year and is on track to start up in 2018. Our Midstream organization achieved a significant milestone by delivering the first LNG cargo from Wheatstone to customers in Japan. We also completed the largest shipbuilding and fleet modernization program in recent Chevron history, taking delivery of our fifth and sixth LNG carriers. Chevron is in the business of progress – providing the energy to help local communities and economies grow and thrive. We know that our role in supplying the reliable, affordable and ever cleaner energy that the world needs is crucial, and we strive to deliver on our commitments. Each year, we invest tens of billions of dollars in jobs, goods and services in the communities around the world where we operate. Our strategic partnerships and social investments represent further important contributions to community prosperity. Over the past five years, we’ve made more than $1.1 billion in social investments globally, consistently placing Chevron in the top quartile of Fortune 100 companies in these investments.
In health, environment and safety for 2017, we maintained industry-leading personal safety rates and outperformed targets for several core metrics. To advance our focus on
eliminating high-consequence incidents and impacts, we developed and deployed tools to assure that safeguards are in place and functioning before beginning high-risk work. We recognize that climate change is a subject of growing interest for investors, stakeholders and the public. In 2017, we engaged with our stockholders to better understand their questions about climate change related to our business.
n response, we have published a new, more in-depth report that addresses our framework for incorporating climate change into our governance, risk management, strategy, and actions and investments. www.chevron.com/climate-change-resilience In our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, we highlight key environmental, social and governance issues and performance. www.chevron.com/cr As we look to the future, there is much we do not know. But a few things are certain. Populations will grow, incomes will rise and people will strive for better lives. Reliable, affordable and ever cleaner energy is essential to support this progress. The world’s population is expected to increase by 1.7 billion people by 2040, and global energy demand is projected to increase by nearly 30 percent over that period. Yet even today, more than a billion people around the world have little or no access to reliable, affordable energy and the human progress it enables. We cannot leave them behind in our pursuit of the future. Oil and natural gas are among the most reliable and affordable forms of energy available across the globe today and are forecast to be a major part of the world’s energy portfolio for the foreseeable future. The world also wants cleaner energy. We continue to make strides in reducing our environmental impact and finding ways to deliver smarter, cleaner energy production. At the same time, we continue to evaluate emerging and future sources of energy and the role they should play in Chevron’s portfolio.
For generations, Chevron has developed and deployed world-class talent across many fields of science and technology to solve some of our most complex and pressing challenges. Individuals and teams across our company are examining the questions of today and the opportunities of tomorrow, pushing boundaries to ensure we deliver on our promises to our stockholders, our partners and our global societies. It was the strength of our people and their commitment to our purpose that enabled Chevron to navigate the pressure of falling commodity prices and expanding supply during the Great Depression; discover crude oil in the desert of Saudi Arabia; help fuel the Allies to victory in World War II; become the first Western energy company to enter newly independent Kazakhstan; and apply technology and innovation to find, produce and transport resources in ever-more-challenging global environments. It is this same strength and commitment that has maintained stability amid the challenge of the recent prolonged period of lower commodity prices. Looking ahead, it is this strength and commitment upon which we will build Chevron’s success. Chevron moves into the future with optimism and purpose, confident in our leadership role in developing the energy that unlocks the potential for progress and prosperity. In doing so, we are committed to delivering industry-leading results and superior stockholder value safely, responsibly and ethically in any operating environment. Thank you for investing in Chevron.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,Energy,2018,"to our stockholders 
This year marks Chevron’s 140th anniversary — a milestone that prompts reflection on our history and admiration for the extraordinary women and men who have built a lasting company based on the belief that energy is vital to human progress. 
This purpose is even clearer now than it was in 1879.
Today, Chevron touches the lives of billions of people across the globe, delivering affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy that offers access to the necessities of modern life, drives economic and social development, and creates the promise for a better future. 
We feel proud and privileged to fulfill this responsibility, to invest in the communities where we operate, and to generate sustained value for our stockholders, customers and employees. 
Our strong performance in 2018 enabled us to deliver on all of our financial priorities — growing the dividend, funding a disciplined capital program, strengthening the balance sheet and returning surplus cash to stockholders. 
For the 31st consecutive year, Chevron increased the annual per-share dividend payout. We returned an additional
$1.75 billion of cash to stockholders through stock repurchases. In addition, we further strengthened the balance sheet, reducing our debt ratio to 18 percent. 
This performance reflects momentum across all our operating segments. 
Our Upstream business reported a highest-ever worldwide net production of more than 2.9 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up more than 7 percent from 2017 and 12 percent from 2016. Production increases were driven by Permian Basin growth, startups in the Gulf of Mexico and Australia, continued ramp-up of liquified natural gas (LNG) operations in Australia, and a high level of reliability at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. 
We added approximately 1.46 billion barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves, replacing 136 percent
of production. Our five-year reserve replacement ratio is 117 percent. 
Chevron increased development drilling in the Permian Basin, and we expect continued strong production growth in the Permian over the next several years. We also acquired new exploration acreage, including six blocks in Brazil and 31 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. Construction continued on the Future Growth Project and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Kazakhstan, including first module delivery and installation. 
In Downstream & Chemicals, we commissioned a new hydrogen plant as part of the Richmond Refinery Modernization Project. In our Oronite additives business, we broke ground on our blending and shipping project in Ningbo, China. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company commissioned its world-scale ethane cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility as part of the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. We also expanded our new retail marketing network in Mexico, with 135 stations opened as of year-end 2018. 
Our Midstream business delivered the first LNG cargo from the Gorgon project to the new LNG receiving terminal in Zhoushan, China, an important achievement that will help China meet its goal of increasing natural gas in its overall energy mix. In the Permian Basin, Chevron strategically secured pipeline capacity to maximize value in advance of our production ramp-up. 
Our Shipping organization supported the safe and successful delivery of the first modular component to the Future Growth Project in Kazakhstan — a voyage of nearly 17,000 miles. 
Chevron delivered these results in a year characterized by healthy global economic activity and heightened geopolitical tensions. Global liquids demand surpassed 100 million barrels a day for the first time ever. Commodity prices rose during the first nine months of 2018, driven by strong demand, before 
declining in the last quarter. LNG markets continued to respond to strength in Asian gas demand. The return of U.S. sanctions on Iran, volatility in the Middle East, trade tensions between China and the United States, Russia sanctions, and worsening conditions in Venezuela created further uncertainty for global energy markets. 
Although market conditions may remain volatile, our portfolio is resilient. We are focused on creating value through a disciplined capital program that prioritizes efficient, low-risk, short-cycle investments. Our Upstream portfolio is anchored by large, long-lived assets with low production decline. An efficient, high-return Downstream business complements 
our Upstream. Across all our business segments, we are accelerating the deployment of digital technologies to improve revenues, reduce costs, increase reliability and improve safety. We are making smart investments and building our company to win in any environment. 
In 2018, we also had our best year ever in health, environment and safety performance, with no fatalities of employees or contractors in any of our operations. We continue to lead the industry in personal safety performance and meet or exceed targets on all core personal safety metrics. This performance is directly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and an increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work. 
In every instance, Chevron’s performance rests on the strong foundation created by our people and our culture. The environment in which we operate is dynamic. The biggest questions of the future remain unanswered. Our work is complex and demanding. Yet for 140 years, the ingenuity 
of our people has led to new insights, new discoveries and new innovations. 
This is not a coincidence. Our culture is defined by our values, which emphasize a deep commitment to diversity and inclusion, high performance, innovation, integrity, and trust. This has been part of our DNA for decades. 
To hold ourselves to this high standard — and to ensure an effective approach to human capital management — we regularly seek employee feedback to understand where Chevron is performing well and where we can further improve. Our Board of Directors takes this input seriously — and we 
act on it. Based on feedback, we are working to Build Our Tomorrow, by putting new digital technologies in the hands of employees, promoting better, faster decision making and revamping our performance management system. 
We use social media and other platforms to create access to information, remove organizational barriers, and bridge vast geographic expanses to exchange ideas and communicate. These are just some of the ways we put The Chevron Way to work, ensuring a culture in which all voices are heard, all ideas are considered and all our people have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest. 
Actions like these are essential in today’s environment. 
But we recognize that leadership goes well beyond delivering strong financial returns and creating a compelling work experience. We must also deliver value for society. 
We provide the affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy needed to meet rising demand. By 2040, the global population is expected to reach roughly 9 billion people, and the International Energy Agency expects global energy demand to increase by nearly 30 percent. Our strengths across Upstream, Midstream and Downstream position 
us to help meet society’s growing need for energy. 
We will meet this demand in a way that respects society’s concerns about climate change and aspirations for a cleaner environment — views we share. This requires innovation. In 2018, we launched the $100 million Future Energy Fund, a venture capital fund established to invest in breakthrough technologies. Early investments include an electric vehicle charging network, novel battery technology and direct capture of carbon dioxide from the air. 
We also joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI),
a coalition of 13 global companies cooperating on constructive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Our commitment includes a $100 million contribution to OGCI’s more than $1 billion fund to invest in technologies and businesses that promise meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions. 
During my first year as chairman and CEO, I visited our operations around the world to listen to and learn from our employees. In my travels, I was often asked: “Why do you work for Chevron?” We work for our families. We work for our communities. We work to make the world a better place. And we work because we are proud of what we do. 
I am honored to serve the women and men of Chevron. I am humbled by the opportunity to help build on our company’s 140-year history and the work of generations of talented problem solvers who have turned some of the greatest challenges of our time into vast, human opportunities for advancement. I am proud, too, to represent a fundamental truth: energy enables human progress. I am committed to this truth, and I am fully confident that our people will continue to lead in the decades to come. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2000,"halliburton initiated significant changes during 2000 as we restructured the Company to profit from 
growing opportunities in the worldwide energy industry. These changes included the decision to divest the Dresser Equipment Group, and the formation of our Energy Services and Engineering and Construction groups. 
Halliburton also experienced a transition in senior management. Dick Cheney retired as our chairman in August to run for vice president of the United States, and I was elected chairman and chief executive officer in addition to my job as president. 
Dick’s tenure was marked by a period of extraordinary growth for Halliburton. In 
five years Halliburton has grown from a $5.7 billion company to its present $11.9 billion size. At the same time, we have become a more closely knit organization with a more focused and unified strategy. We’re grateful for Dick’s service and commitment to Halliburton and wish him well in his new role in public life. 
In 2000, the demand for energy services was particularly strong in the U.S., as both crude oil and natural gas prices rose substantially, and oil and gas companies increased their expenditures for exploration and production (E&P) projects. However, historically two-thirds of Halliburton’s energy services business comes from outside the U.S., and demand for energy services in international areas 
has been slower to accelerate. As exploration and development increases overseas in 2001, we are in an excellent position to continue to grow our revenues and earnings in the upstream oil and gas sector. Overall, oil and gas company E&P spending was up by more than 18 percent in 2000. Early estimates for 2001 are for additional spending growth of around 20 percent. 
The demand for Engineering & Construction (E&C) projects, however, did not mirror that for energy services. In 2000, higher prices for oil and gas had not yet translated to increased spending by our customers on E & C projects in the liquefied natural gas (LNG), refining, and petrochemical industries. This lack of market opportunities, along with a consolidating customer base and a fiercely competitive environment, contributed to my decision to restructure the E&C group. This change will help us gain operating efficiencies and provide a stronger platform for consistent profitability with improved operating margins. Current and projected strength in the energy services markets in the U.S. and overseas should be followed by increased spending in the E&C sector. We expect this to begin in late 2001 and 2002. 
Halliburton’s 2000 revenues from continuing operations were $11.9 billion. Net income for the year, including discontinued operations, was $501 million, 
and $188 million from continuing operations. Earnings per diluted share were $1.12, compared with $.99 per share for 1999. Discontinued operations are those of the Dresser Equipment Group, which is in the process of being sold. 
The Energy Services Group includes our business units providing services and products to the upstream oil and gas business. The group’s 2000 revenues were $7.9 billion, compared to $7.0 billion in 1999, while operating income more than doubled to $526 million in 2000, compared to $222 million in 1999. This dramatic improvement came from stronger demand for energy services in North America. 
The E&C group’s revenues were $4.0 billion, compared to $5.3 billion in 1999, and operating income was $14 million, compared to $203 million in 1999. This decline was a reflection of the lack of new downstream projects, and intense compe- tition for the few available opportunities. 
Our third business segment, Dresser Equipment Group, was reclassified as discontinued operations after we decided to sell the business. The group is performing well, but their lines of business do not closely fit our core business and our long-term goals and objectives. This move will bring a sharper focus on our core business activities. 
The estimated $1.1 billion net proceeds will be used for working capital and to repay debt, which will leave us in an even stronger financial position to pursue strategic acquisitions and internal invest- ment opportunities. We expect a pretax profit of about $500 million from the sale and expect it to be completed in the sec- ond quarter of 2001. Halliburton will retain a 5 percent equity stake. 
The changes in our Energy Services and E&C groups have been driven by the same strategic goals: to improve the competitive position of our product lines, to bring a new intensity and focus to our commitment to the energy industry, and to improve profitability. 
In the Energy Services Group, this means a renewed focus on optimizing the value of our individual product lines – turning their brand name capital and strong market position into higher profit margins. This will be the focus of the energy services management in 2001. 
At the same time, in order to make our E&C organization flatter and simpler, I combined all our engineering and construction operations into one company. All engineering, construction, fabrication, and project management are now part of Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR). 
The restructuring has achieved a reduction in the number of executives in the company, and a flatter, more responsive, management structure in both business segments. This organization will both strengthen our individual discrete product and service lines, and at the same time give us a more effective framework for developing integrated technology products, and for pursuing large integrated projects. 
The most significant application for integrated technologies over the next several years is in deepwater exploration and production projects. We estimate there will be about $21 billion committed annually to deepwater projects by 2004, up from $8 billion in 2000. 
Winning these projects requires project management skills, the ability to match the subsurface and surface work, to perform and integrate services during the project, and to develop new enabling technologies – all Halliburton strengths. And we’ve proven our ability to compete by winning the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the $2.5 billion Barracuda/Caratinga offshore project in Brazil. 
Our organization and our technology strategy – the focus of this annual report – are designed to position Halliburton to win large projects and continue our worldwide leadership in providing discrete energy services. I would like to thank all of our employees who are executing the business strategies which will drive future success for the Company and our shareholders. 



"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2001,"dear fellow shareholders, 
Employee motivation has a direct bearing on financial results. With
$13 billion in revenue, 2001 was a good year for Halliburton, and I’d like to thank the management team and our highly motivated workforce for their contributions that help continue to position Halliburton as one of the best, most focused and innovative service companies in the world. 
Our Energy Services Group ended 2001 with record operating income while our Engineering & Construction Group, Halliburton KBR, exceeded its revenue and margin commitments and continues to be awarded quality jobs on terms that should enhance future returns on capital. 
Within the Energy Services Group, both Landmark Graphics and Halliburton Energy Services had excellent results, despite the decline in rig activity in the United States toward the end of the year. Both businesses benefited from their strong international presence and broad suite of products and services. 
The pressures facing Halliburton’s customers are among our biggest challenges. What drives the oil and gas industry is the same today as it will always be. Our customers have to 
find and replace the oil and gas they produce every year. They have to do it from increasingly remote and hostile locations, and they have to bring it to market at a cost that’s commercially and politically acceptable. 
The future performance of Halliburton strongly depends on technology. In 2001, Halliburton spent just under $300 million on technologies aimed at our existing businesses and product lines. We plan to continue our technology spending at approximately this rate in 2002. 
In addition, we are prepared to make equity investments in technologies that are attractive in the marketplace to either expand our current portfolio or to create entirely new businesses. This type of investment is not new to our Company; Halliburton has spent almost $600 million on external technology over the 
past three years. These types of opportunities do not come along every day. Continuing this pace of external investment depends on our ability to identify and acquire new technologies that will create value to our shareholders. 
Halliburton’s technology investment will ensure that we increase production, increase reserves, decrease capital and operating costs, reduce uncertainty and improve productivity for our customers. 
The technology challenge for our industry is immense. Most of the promising reservoirs our customers pursue today are in deeper and deeper water. Today, we are drilling wells more than 25,000 feet into the earth in over 10,000 feet of water. Developing oil
and gas resources in deep water requires extraordinary technology. 
As well as investing in deepwater and data-management technologies, we’re strengthening our focus on Real Time Reservoir SolutionsSM (RTRS). This means dramatically improving the speed and quality of decisions needed to develop the reservoir. We do this by providing accurate, instant information from wells and surface-production systems. Teams observing the data use it to make timely reservoir management decisions during operations. This is changing the way our customers manage production. Geology, engineering and facilities design processes are becoming integrated. Customers will be able to manage their facilities, their maintenance, and their safety and environmental compliance from operational control centers. Specialists will be able to monitor and direct well-site operations for multiple fields from a visualization room mounted on a single platform. 
So, Halliburton is investing in the future. We will have the substantial technological prowess needed for the industry’s longer-term challenges.
For several years, the finding and development costs of the global energy industry were declining; now they’re on the rise again. Our technology is changing the business processes in well construction, well production and asset management. Within a short time, we believe our technologies will help cut well construction costs by 50 percent. 
Also of fundamental importance to our prosperity is management of the Halliburton brand. If our brand is more trusted, relied upon and stronger than the competition’s, we will generate 
superior results. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we launched a brand alignment and positioning program. This followed a comprehensive, globally researched brand identity program carried out to effectively position Halliburton for the future. Despite the emotion felt in different parts of the organization, this was an important evolution for the Company. The name “Halliburton” is synonymous with quality, trust, integrity and technology. The initiative enhances those qualities while respecting the rich heritage of our founding fathers, Erle P. Halliburton, George and Herman Brown, Solomon Dresser and Morris W. Kellogg. 
Our success in business also requires
a commitment to social citizenship, business ethics and corporate perspective. This includes having respect for the environment, concern for employee safety and welfare, and giving back to the communities in which we work. I can’t overemphasize the importance of Health, Safety & Environment (HSE)
to our Company’s operations. The health and safety of employees, and those
we work with, is vital. HSE is one of our core values, and it will never be sacrificed in the name of profits. 
Investing in the future means different things in different parts of the world. In developing countries, it may mean providing opportunities for 
training and employment or employees volunteering time to help build schools and hospitals. It certainly includes a willingness to balance the demand for short-term profits with the resources we need for success in the future. As CEO of Halliburton, I believe one of my responsibilities is to set the tone for our Company’s commitment to the right social responsibility and to help us find a way to balance these obligations with the demands of our shareholders. 
One of the most wonderful aspects of our Company, and one of our great challenges, is our diversity. With 85,000 employees, working in about 400 locations in more than 100 countries, when I walk the corridors of any Halliburton facility, I am pleased to see employees of every race, culture and religion, and hear the languages of almost every nation. I also see the pride and the connection our employees have to their country, to our Company, customers and partners. 
The terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001 touched us all in different ways. I am very proud of the way Halliburton employees around the world rallied in support of the victims. The impact of 9/11 on the corporate world has been huge in the short term, but I believe long-term prospects for the worldwide economy remain bright, 
particularly for our industry sector.
The Halliburton stock price dropped 
precipitously toward the end of the year. There were several reasons for the drop. First, there was overall uneasiness about the U.S. and global economies and the negative impact on oil and gas prices, and the tragic events of 9/11 heightened those concerns. But the main reason 
was reaction to several sizable asbestos- related jury verdicts against the Company. The lawsuits relate mainly to products manufactured by various divisions of Dresser Inc. and past operations of Brown & Root. The largest category of claims relates to Harbison-Walker, a refractory company that Dresser spun off in 1992. 
Although we’ve worked hard to explain our strategy, it’s likely that the investment community will continue to express concern about our asbestos- related activities in the face of softening fundamentals in the oilfield services industry. We take the issue very seriously and understand the concerns our shareholders have. Asbestos litigation is a U.S. national problem – many companies are affected – and the civil justice system is producing uneven and inequitable results. We believe asbestos litigation needs serious review by Congress. In the meantime, the Company has substantial insurance, we 
continue to pursue what I believe is the right litigation strategy, and we are conducting a vigorous defense of asbestos lawsuits. 
While these issues have had a negative impact on our share price in the near term, we will continue to work through this problem without losing sight of our strong global market position and our underlying corporate strategy. We will continue to invest in the people, equipment and technologies that we believe will make us successful. Our businesses are strong and healthy, and our financial disclosure is accurate and complete. 
While the global economic slowdown has hurt the demand for hydrocarbons, the fundamental nature of our industry has not changed. We are driven by supply and demand. Energy prices are cyclical, our business is cyclical, and we have to deal with the current downturn as best we can. Halliburton has a strong history of performance that helps us ride through weak periods. We continue to introduce new technologies that will give us a competitive advantage even in the face of soft demand. We’re always looking for innovative business relationships that will keep us working and keep our customers developing, in spite of short-term price fluctuations. Steering a course through price swings is one of the great 
management challenges in our business. How well we succeed is an indicator of our overall management quality. 
We can count on one thing. Our industry will always be affected by world events and economics. None of our technologies will change that, and none of them are short-term solutions. They require heavy investment, and they demand that we change the way we think and work. We must pursue the technologies that are best for our Company and our industry tomorrow, next year and for the next generation. 
By most measures, and certainly
in light of current industry conditions, we have completed an excellent year. The full year’s earnings from continuing operations exceed all prior years combined since the Dresser merger.
We are very well positioned for “through the cycle” revenues and earnings,
with almost $10 billion in backlog and industry-leading people, technology, products and services. 

"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2002,"DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS, 
In 2001, Real Time technology began transforming Halliburton into a faster, smarter, more responsive service company. This year, we took the next step and made Service Quality a Company-wide campaign. 
At Halliburton, we’ve always prided ourselves on our ability to perform under the most extreme conditions or constraints. But with the economy laboring under the strain of geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, the market- place demands even more. We believe that Service Quality, or knowing what customers expect and delivering it right the first time, will give us the edge. Companies that can consistently deliver exceptional Service Quality will win on every front – customer satisfaction, employee motivation and shareholder value. 
Throughout these pages, you’re going to see and read stories of Halliburton people achieving Service Quality beyond expectations. You’ll see them on job sites in remote and demanding places, in laboratories and manufactur- ing facilities around the world. You’ll meet teams, individuals, old hands and newcomers. And what you’re going to notice is how much pride they 
have in what they do. They are excited about where they work and how
hard they work. They’re proud of their years of experience and their loyalty to the Company. They are Halliburton. 
And it is through their efforts, and the efforts of thousands more like them, that Halliburton has achieved good financial performance in 2002 – even during a difficult environment. 
Looking back, 2001 gave rise to a new and frightening world with fear of terrorism, the war in Afghanistan, a global recession and growing geopoliti- cal instability. That atmosphere has persisted, making many companies hesitant to increase their investments because of concerns of what might happen in the future. Yet, despite all this, and the cloud of asbestos litiga- tion, 2002 was a very good year for Halliburton. While revenues were down slightly for the year, we are very pleased with our performance relative to our peers in this very difficult environment. I’d like to thank the management team and hard-working Halliburton people everywhere. 
Certainly, one of the biggest news items for Halliburton this year has been the progress we have made toward resolving our asbestos litigation problem. We still have a long way to go and may not get there, but we are working toward a resolution that we believe will result in a fair and equitable settlement with the asbestos claimants and free us to concentrate on the future. 
Overall, we had solid results from the Energy Services Group. Following a record year for the Energy Services Group in 2001, reduced drilling activity in the United States and Canada and 
increased pricing pressures in 2002 resulted in a 12 percent drop in revenues for the Energy Services Group. Yet, in spite of the decline in rig activity, Sperry-Sun had record revenues of $1 billion, and Landmark Graphics again had excellent revenues and operating income increases. 
Higher revenues on the Engineering & Construction side of the business offset the Energy Services Group’s decreased revenues. The Engineering & Construction Group’s onshore and offshore business revenues increased by 25 percent or more, while the Infrastructure business experienced a 22 percent rise. 
With large contract wins in Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria, KBR continues to perform extremely well in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. Government Services also experienced significant successes, including a site support serv- ices contract with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and a design-build contract for the new U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, Afghanistan. 
A continuing bright spot for both business groups was the international market. Halliburton’s international revenues increased in 2002 to 67 percent of total revenues from 62 percent
a year ago. Another positive was
the dispositions of non-core business assets that bolstered our liquidity. 
Last year, our message was of transformation. The transformation continues, sweeping through every part of the Company:
• There have been major organizational 
changes, as the Energy Services
Group (ESG) and Engineering & Construction Group (KBR) became two independent business units in 2002. There were many reasons for this restructuring: liquidity pressures in a more difficult global business environment; competitive pressures to have the best possible cost structure; pressure on the stock price due to asbestos litigation; and the increasingly different business drivers, business cycles and customers of the Energy Services Group and Engineering & Construction Group. But the overriding reason? Restructuring will enable both companies to strengthen their busi- nesses and go head-to-head with our most powerful competitors, many of them companies that have an emphasis on one core competency. This will, in turn, position Halliburton to achieve sustained growth and profitability. 
• There have been management changes. Edgar Ortiz, the chief executive officer of the ESG, retired Dec. 31 after a distinguished 33-year career in the industry, and Halliburton Energy Services President John Gibson succeeded him. KBR continues under the leadership of Randy Harl. Doug Foshee is now our chief operating officer, and C. Christopher Gaut has joined us as chief financial officer. 
• There have been fundamental business changes, with the Engineering & Construction Group making a bold move in deciding it will no longer pursue lump-sum engineering, procurement, installation and com- missioning (EPIC) projects for the offshore oil and gas industry until and unless the current business model improves to allow for reasonable profits at reasonable risks. 
The oil and gas industry is historically boom or bust. Since the collapse in prices in late 1998, oil prices have been even more unstable than in past decades. The tight energy supply-and-demand balance in the industry these days means that even small shifts can lead to large swings in prices. 
Clearly, we are at a point in time where we must redesign our Company for short commodity price cycles and position ourselves technologically, operationally and culturally to respond as the energy industry is evolving. That means looking beyond what will make us successful this year, and for- ward into the next 10 years. 
We’re working hard to increase our productivity so that we can accomplish more with a smaller core group. Programs that align employee perform- ance and compensation with our busi- ness objectives are an important first step. Our intense Service Quality focus will produce more efficiencies, as well as a competitive advantage. 
We’re also finding ways to work 
with our customers to improve overall efficiency. This could mean a restruc- turing of traditional relationships. Or it could mean collaborative relation- ships yielding more focused, effective products and services. At Halliburton, different times call for fresh thinking. 
Innovation is the means by which companies exploit change as an oppor- tunity for growth, and technology will continue to be a major thrust of our strategy. Over the past five years, Halliburton has invested more than
$1 billion developing game-changing technologies in almost every product line. Instead of designing products to compete head-to-head with others in the market, our aim is to create products that optimize assets, solve problems and deliver long-term value for ourselves and our customers. 
Today at the ESG, new technology accounts for more than 20 percent of our total revenues. But innovation can also be achieved by integrating existing technologies to provide new or improved offerings, and we are pursuing opportuni- ties to do this. 
At the same time, we are shifting our economic resources into areas of higher productivity and greater yields. The Energy Services Group and Engineering & Construction Group currently hold the No. 1 or No. 2 positions in most of their product lines. The Energy Services Group derives more than 75 percent of its revenue today from product service lines where it holds a No. 1 or No. 2 position. 
In the months ahead, you will see us developing strategies and investing to sustain and grow those positions in all of our product lines because that’s what will generate the profitability to sustain us, boom or bust. 
I’ve said before how important Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) is to Halliburton. Respect for the environment and for the health and safety of our employees and others that we work with is a core value, and we are a leader in this arena. HSE is really about good business practices. Take, for instance, Company-mandated driver safety initiatives. There’s a clear correlation between not wearing seat belts and 
cell phone use while driving and the quantity and severity of incidents
that impact the health and safety of our employees. Adverse incidents have a negative impact on insurance rates and worker productivity, which increase our cost of operations. A zero incidents objective is not just a good idea, it’s good business. 
Protecting the environment as we go forward in the next decades is another good business practice – management of environmental risks saves money today and demonstrates our commitment to a better environment. Halliburton is developing new technologies that will help our customers address some of their most pressing environmental needs. 
For instance, Halliburton developed the Sea Emerald Burner for well testing, which produces a 99.9 percent clean 
burn, back in 1994. It’s still considered the industry standard. But as good as it is, the result is still significant ther- mal releases that are suspected to add to global warming. Now, we’re working on technologies that will eliminate flaring altogether, such as open-hole test techniques, formation testing while drilling and under-balanced drilling methods that enable us to evaluate the reservoir in real time while drilling. 
All of these technologies are environ- mentally responsible, but none of them will be truly successful unless they are more cost-efficient and effective. It’s entirely achievable, too, as we learned from developing our new AccoladeTM drilling fluid system. Designed to conform to stricter regulatory standards in the Gulf of Mexico, Accolade dramatically increased the rate of penetration over traditional fluids while significantly reducing fluid losses from as many as 5,000 barrels to a few hundred barrels. It’s a great example of how creativity within guidelines resulted in cost and performance breakthroughs. 
As we look into the future, we can see that challenges abound in every area of our industry. Our industry’s workforce in North America and Europe is aging, and few young people are entering the ranks. But Halliburton is finding and training talented young professionals at our locations around the world. Engineers from countries like Malaysia, Angola, Russia and the Caspian Sea region are bringing fresh perspectives 
and drive. They are welcome additions to the Halliburton family. 
The next 10 years will require diligence and imagination. And despite current industry conditions, I am very encour- aged. We are transforming our internal processes. We’re improving our execution and our products. Everywhere you look, the Energy Services Group and Engineering & Construction Group are being re-energized. 
We’re evolving in our industry from having value in fixed assets to having value in intellectual capital, which makes us very rich indeed. Because Halliburton people are the finest that the industry has to offer. As I walk the hallways and visit job sites, the feeling I get from managers to field personnel is that we are entering the most exciting period in our history. They are pleased to be here at this point in time, with all its risks and opportunities, because for the companies that can think clearly and act quickly, the rewards will be great. 
I’d like to thank the people of Halliburton for their spirit, dedication and sense of adventure. I’m proud to work with you.

Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2003,"Dear Fellow Shareholders 
Halliburton was started in 1919 in the oil fields of Texas by one man with a homemade cement mixer and a borrowed pump. Today, we are a world leader in oilfield services, engineering and construction, with over 100,000 employees and operations in more than 100 countries. Throughout the course 
of our history, we have experienced great transitions and every kind of business cycle more times than we can count. We have been here this long and come this far because of our ability to adapt to change. That ability has been tested over the past few years, but as I look back on our accomplishments in 2003, I’m extremely proud and optimistic about the future. 
We have made significant progress toward resolving our asbestos liability that has consumed so much of our resources. Despite some pretty big challenges, including a sluggish U.S. economy, our Energy Services Group (ESG) and KBR, our Engineering and Construction Group, have both had a successful year, posting significantly improved revenues. 
One day, I believe, we will look back on 2003 as a watershed year when we took steps to become a leaner, tougher organization and continued to put ourselves in position to win in the years ahead. 
We reorganized the ESG into four P&L divisions addressing four core customer needs. In addition, four new regional and 10 sub-regional organizations have been established, centered around natural geographic markets and aimed at further extending the ESG’s global growth. For the first time, we have broken out the ESG’s financials by divisions and regions to provide greater transparency to the financial community, and this move is being hailed by many analysts as a model for the industry. 
In three of the ESG’s divisions – Fluids, Landmark 
and Production Optimization – the ESG maintains a leading presence. About 75 percent of its revenues are being generated from product lines where it holds a No. 1 or No. 2 market share. One of our biggest success stories of 2003 has been within the Drilling and Formation Evaluation division with a product that holds the No. 3 position in its market. In last year’s annual report, we introduced you to Geo-Pilot® point-the-bit rotary steerable technology. The product was deployed in 2001, and by 2002, our market share went from 0 percent to 9 percent. During 2003, our market share jumped to 15 percent and is still growing. We have also seen growth in our international revenues across all of our businesses. 
There has been solid progress on the engineering, construction and services side of Halliburton’s busi- ness as well. Since KBR made the decision in 2002 to no longer enter into undifferentiated offshore lump-sum, turnkey Engineering, Procurement, Installation and Commissioning (EPIC) contracts, we have continued to rebalance our portfolio 
by drawing upon KBR’s Centers of Excellence,
or core business strengths, to grow the services and program management part of the business. The strategy is already yielding significant contract wins, including the Kashagan oilfield development Project Management Contract (PMC) for offshore and onshore Kazakhstan, and the reimbursable Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) contract for a major floating production offloading and storage vessel offshore Angola. KBR was also awarded the Program Management Contract to restructure and modernize the U.K. National Health Service’s information technology systems. 
Most of the major international oil companies have targeted clean-burning natural gas as a key area of their growth strategies. KBR continues to hold a leading market position in constructing plants for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and is responsible for building 56 percent of the world’s LNG capacity over the last 30 years. As worldwide demand for LNG continues to increase, more than doubling current levels by 2010, KBR will be right there, developing new technology, building on its know-how and delivering the projects that customers need. 
KBR also has much to be proud of for the work
it is doing in support of various military troops in locations across the globe. KBR was recently awarded a contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to support military operations, federal agencies and governments throughout the U.S. Central Command’s 25-country region that extends from the Horn of Africa to Central Asia. 
As part of its competitively bid Logistics Civil Augmentation Program III (LOGCAP III) contract with the U.S. Army, KBR employees are providing 
the logistical support and infrastructure for Army bases in Iraq, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Djibouti, Jordan, the Republic of Georgia and Turkey. KBR provides everything from food, beds and mail service to laundry, sanitation and utilities. Under a separate contract for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers known as Restore Iraqi Oil (RIO), KBR, with assistance from ESG reservoir and data management experts, has restored the country’s 
oil production to pre-war levels, working with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. 
The work in southern Iraq was competitively
bid and a new contract has been awarded for two years, with three one-year optional extensions.
We will provide a range of services and support – from extinguishing oil well fires and providing environmental assessments and cleanup at oil sites, to supplying design and construction of infrastructure and technical assistance, as well as consulting 
services to the Iraqi oil companies – that will help Iraq build a sustainable future for its people. We’re assisting Iraqis in their daily lives, too, by importing and delivering massive amounts of fuel for driving, cooking and heating. 
These are tough, demanding assignments in a dangerous region. Just 72 hours after the first troops entered Iraq, KBR followed with water and meals. Our people have been under fire and some have lost their lives. To all of the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to get the job done, I give my thanks and sincerest admiration. 
What it takes to be successful in the 21st century is different than it was even a decade ago. The continuing consolidation of the super majors, the growing power of the national oil companies, cost- cutting issues and globalization are challenges that all of us face. We are no longer accountable only to local or national interests; we are a citizen of the world. 
That’s not a new concept for Halliburton. Throughout our 84-year history, we have contributed to the economic development of communities around the planet by assisting in delivering oil and gas revenues to host governments; building roads, tracks, tunnels and bridges for moving freight; and providing local employment and trade. Our commitment to real time technology has created
a new way of working that allows us to maximize limited resources – whether it’s hydrocarbon resources or human ones. 
Our commitment to Service Quality, along with Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), is elimi- nating health, safety and environmental incidents
at the job site, as well as the waste of precious resources and capital. The technologies we’ve devel- oped are helping customers develop their assets in less time for lower costs and with fewer risks. We’re participating with many of our customers and host governments to create global solutions to energy 
problems. Recently, we posted a representative to a two-year assignment with the World Bank to work on the Global Gas Flaring Reduction team and to help it develop alternatives for harmful gas flaring practices, encouraging the use of saved gas as a cheap and clean fuel for local communities. 
Since the earliest times, a long and prosperous future has been the hope of almost everyone on this planet. The secret of longevity is one of humankind’s greatest quests. Building a Sustainable Future is a process that requires everyone in the organization working together to improve efficiencies. It requires our will and the courage to adapt to an ever-changing and challenging future by understanding and responding to the needs of customers in diverse markets; by identifying and exploiting opportunities without succumbing to market volatility and risk;
by committing to continuous innovation; and by understanding that a company thrives not just by capturing markets, but by developing its people. 
I couldn’t end this message without a big thank you to our shareholders who have stayed with us and continue to believe in our Company. And most of all I want to thank our wonderful Halliburton employees. In a year of transitions, and in the face of some pretty big challenges, you have kept your heads down, worked hard and performed magnifi- cently, providing excellent customer service, strong returns and good profits. You never, ever gave up. This, more than anything, is what gives me hope for our future. Just imagine what we can accomplish together once our full power is unleashed. I am proud to work alongside you. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2004,"DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS 
For 85 years, Halliburton has weathered every sort of challenge to our Company. But I think we will remember 2004 as the year we overcame extreme adversity. Unprecedented asbestos claims, dangerous work with the armed forces in Iraq, public cynicism about large corporations, a U.S. vice president with past ties to our company – all of these issues converged in an election year as some tried to turn the proud old name Halliburton into a political symbol. 
Today, as we stand on the brink of a bright and exciting future, I am proud to report that not only has Halliburton survived some of the greatest challenges ever faced by any company, but we have emerged stronger than ever. 
Look at our financial position: our revenue and operating income increased in 2004 and our stock climbed steadily through the year. Although the charges we took to resolve our asbestos liabilities, the Barracuda-Caratinga project and other outstanding issues in KBR depressed our bottom-line financial results, our liquidity remains strong, and I believe that both the Energy Services Group (ESG) and KBR are positioned for profitability in 2005. For any who doubted the strength and integrity of our Company, I think the continuing support of our shareholders and customers speaks for itself. I want to thank you for standing behind us. 
One of our most daunting tasks this year was concluding the largest and most complex prepackaged bankruptcy that has ever been accomplished, resolving our asbestos and silica liability. I deeply appreciate the members of our team who worked to achieve a fair solution for those who were impaired by asbestos exposure – a resolution that many said would never be possible. 
The value of the settlement included a cash contribution of $2.775 billion to fund a trust for current claimants;
we also issued 59.5 million shares of Halliburton common stock for the benefit of future asbestos claimants. This has been somewhat offset by insurance collections from more than 150 insurance companies, which I view as a monumental achievement. So far, we have collected more than $1 billion from these companies, and we expect to collect about $500 million more. 
Halliburton achieved another significant milestone in 2004 when the Barracuda floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel produced first oil in December. Barracuda’s sister ship, Caratinga, also achieved first oil in February, 2005. Our $2.5 billion 
contract – which included converting two oil tankers into FPSO vessels and developing the 54-well Barracuda and Caratinga oil fields in offshore Brazil – was the largest engineering, procurement, installation and construction (EPIC) contract ever undertaken by a single contractor. Since then, we have moved away from lump sum off- shore contracts and have had good success with our new cost-reimbursable approach to this type of work. 
The political rhetoric we faced in the United States has subsided since Election Day – but not without a price. In the months leading up to the election, the false, misleading and unfair allegations about Halliburton seemed to multiply exponentially, simply because the nation’s vice president once held my job. We worked tirelessly to address these relentless accusations, to cooperate with every investigation, and to challenge and correct misinformation. 
Now that we have overcome these difficulties, it is time to look beyond – beyond asbestos, beyond Barracuda- Caratinga, beyond the politics – to the immense potential of Halliburton. In 2005, I look forward to spending my time on more constructive endeavors: growing the busi- ness and pursuing my vision for the Company’s future. 
We have a world-class leadership team in place to help us move forward. Upon the retirement of the former KBR chairman and the departure from the Company of the ESG president and CEO, I eliminated those positions to create a flatter, more streamlined reporting structure. Now the senior vice presidents of all KBR and ESG operating segments will report directly to Andrew Lane, whom I appointed chief operating officer. I am profoundly grateful for our talented, thoughtful and dedicated leadership team members who have supported me this year – Andy; Cris Gaut, our chief financial officer; and Bert Cornelison, our general counsel. 
In the coming year, we will continue to review our full portfolio, including the future of KBR. The positive value potential that KBR brings has not been reflected in Halliburton’s stock price. Therefore, we intend to separate KBR from the Company. This separation could take a number of forms, including a spin-off or split-off, an initial public offering, or the sale of KBR. 
However, I believe that, in order to maximize KBR’s value for our shareholders, it may be necessary to establish a track record of positive earnings for several quarters and to resolve government investigations 
and outstanding disputes. During that time, we will investigate our options and determine the best value, terms and structure for a transaction. We have reorgan- ized KBR into two segments, Energy & Chemicals and Government & Infrastructure, to support this effort. 
Halliburton’s most remarkable asset, now and always,
is its people. In 2004, they had to defend their honorable work while their every action was examined as if they were under a magnifying glass. Yet, even in the darkest moments, their support never wavered. I am proud of our employees. Their passionate commitment, gritty determination and unswerving faith in our Company have been my greatest source of pride and inspiration. 
As I write this letter, more than 47,000 KBR employees and contractors – the largest civilian force ever assembled – are working alongside U.S. troops in Iraq, far from their homes and their families. This is demanding, dangerous work. Sixty of our employees and subcontractors have been killed, 250 have been wounded and one is still missing. As difficult as this is to accept, it has been made even harder by those who seek to politicize the work of these brave men and women. 
One of the brightest moments we shared this year happened when we welcomed Tommy Hamill home. Tommy was kidnapped when the truck convoy he commanded was ambushed by Iraqi militants. His courage in escaping his captors not once, but twice, exemplifies the “can do” attitude of the Halliburton employees who have volunteered for these positions. This ethic traces its origins back to our founders, Erle P. Halliburton and the Brown brothers, whose legendary determination to get the job done, no matter what, made them industry icons. 
Heartened by the amazing spirit of Halliburton people, we will honor our commitment to our customer, the U.S. government, and continue supporting our troops. It’s the right thing to do. 
This year, in our television commercials, we told the public, “It’s not who we know. It’s what we know.”
The truth of this statement is evident in the many government and infrastructure contracts KBR won this year through competitive bidding – including two important construction contracts to support U.S. Navy facilities, as well as a logistics support contract with the U.K. Ministry of Defence. 
Nobody is better than KBR at what we do. Worldwide, KBR is well-positioned to benefit from increased demand for unconventional sources of gas. KBR has built a large portion of the world’s LNG capacity, and this year was part of a joint venture team that received the engineering, procurement and construction contract to build another train for Nigeria LNG Limited – the fourth this company has awarded us. KBR is also part of a joint venture selected for design work on a grassroots LNG facility 
in Western Australia. 
In addition, KBR is pioneering innovative gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology that will help the world bring its remote gas reser ves to market. KBR is par t of a joint venture that was selected to provide front end engineering and design services for Shell’s GTL project in Qatar. 
In the ESG, business is thriving. We established annual records in revenue and operating income for three of
the four ESG segments in 2004, and the total ESG group posted record revenue in the fourth quarter. I attribute this outstanding performance in revenue to our customers’ increased spending levels, and also to improved pricing as capacity tightened. Operating margins benefited from the improved pricing as well, but also from the ESG’s focus on capital discipline and improved cost structure. We expect activity in the oil and gas industry to remain robust through 2005. 
Like KBR, the ESG has also enjoyed the staunch support of its customers during this difficult year. One of our strengths is the ability to integrate our services across all product lines for an economically optimized, total reservoir solution. Petroleum Development Oman is one company that is taking advantage of this capability, with three contracts worth up to $500 million over five years 
to provide cementing, stimulation, directional drilling, logging-while-drilling and mud logging services. 
Throughout the ESG, we are building on our strengths
for the future. For instance, our Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment is unlocking the burgeoning logging- while-drilling market with its Geo-Pilot® rotary steerable technologies. In 2004, this segment won contracts for drilling and related services in Brunei, Azerbaijan, Mexico and North America, as well as in both the U.K. and Norway sectors of the North Sea. The segment also introduced its new polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) fixed cutter bit technology, representing a step-change for longer bit life and cost-effective drilling. In the roller cone bit market, our EnergyBalanced® technology, which allows us to design custom bits quickly for specific conditions encoun- tered in the field, continues to make inroads. The value of this innovation is underlined by our recent award in a patent infringement case against a competitor. 
With 95 percent of its revenue in No. 1 or No. 2 market share positions, the Production Optimization segment
is ideally positioned as operators seek to boost declining production in the world’s maturing reservoirs. We recently won two major contracts in the prime stimulation market of the U.S. Rockies. We also celebrated a three-year contract for well completions in Qatar’s giant North Gas field, awarded by Dolphin Energy Limited – Qatar. The reliability and performance of Halliburton’s Peak® large monobore downhole completion equipment is critical to the success of the high-rate gas well completions that this project requires. Other technology advancements include the new DeepReachSM coiled tubing service and DeepQuestSM stimulation service. These technologies enable operators to recover harder-to-access deepwater reserves more economically. 
Halliburton Digital and Consulting Solutions, formerly the Landmark and Other Energy Services segment,
is advancing its leadership position in software while growing its consulting practice to capture an untapped market opportunity. This year, the group signed five-year technology agreements to support both PEMEX and Statoil with a broad range of prospect generation and field development software. Another three-year agreement delivers information management services to China. 
On the technology frontier, Landmark Graphics Corporation announced the release of DecisionSpace®
Well Seismic FusionTM, a unique suite of interpretation and analysis tools to improve reservoir understanding and dramatically reduce exploration risk. Working with Silicon Graphics and Marathon Oil Company, Landmark achieved another breakthrough in the search for new oil and gas reserves with advanced interactive visualization that allows scientists to evaluate acreage rapidly using four times more seismic information than previously possible. 
The Fluids Systems segment is leveraging its strong market leadership in cementing to further improve its pricing in this robust market. In our Baroid product line, our focus in 2004 has been on rightsizing our operations in areas that have been slow to pick up, particularly the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Baroid is launching projects in Mexico and Bangladesh in alliance with National Oilwell to provide solids control and waste management services and equipment at the rig site. Similar operations are already under way in the 
United States, Venezuela and Brazil. We are very excited by this new market oppor tunity. 
Throughout both KBR and the ESG, innovative new technologies are helping customers reduce costs, improve productivity, use resources more efficiently and maximize the return on their investment. The industry recognized our innovation by honoring Halliburton with more prestigious technology awards than any other service company, including three for the DepthStar® subsur face safety valve. 
At Halliburton, we’re committed not just to our customers and shareholders, but also to all of the communities that we call home. Everywhere I travel, I see employees in red T-shirts cleaning beaches, building schools, feeding the hungry, raising money for medical research and caring for those who need our help the most. I hear about employees who have made tough decisions to handle situations ethically. I know how hard our Company works to develop eco-friendly technologies and minimize the environmental footprint we leave on our job sites. I support the priority we place on safety, which has earned us the reputation as the best in this arena. All across the Company, all around the world, I’m proud of the work we do. 
As the challenges of 2004 fade into the past and the opportunities of a new year come into focus, it is easy to see beyond the rhetoric, beyond the litigation – beyond all the other difficulties – to the promising future of this great Company. 
From my seat, I like what I see.

Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2005,"TO OUR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS: 
We, the members of the senior management team, are very proud of the results Halliburton delivered in 2005. And we are equally excited about the prospects for 2006; we anticipate continuing growth in oilfield services revenue and operating income, as well as further quality additions to KBR’s project backlog. 
Most of this report is devoted to bringing you the details of our financial performance, but there is much more to
the Halliburton story. We also want to draw your attention to what drives the numbers – the organization, the strategy, and the people. 
While strong demand for Halliburton’s services certainly played a role in our robust returns, Halliburton has also performed well relative to the competition. The fundamental drivers to our success are our investment in technology, equipment, and people. Especially people. A handful of senior managers in Houston don’t produce results like these; it takes the combined creativity and expertise of more than 100,000 Halliburton people worldwide. 
Our organization has transformed in recent years in order to be profitable at every division and to empower our people at all levels. Our 2005 success and our bright prospects for 2006 are, in large measure, the result of that transformation. 
Our company is organized into six divisions – four in the Energy Services Group (ESG) and two in KBR – each with a distinct mission and a unique business niche. 
To provide a picture of the accomplishments, challenges, and personality of each division, we have asked the division leaders to supplement this letter with their own reports. Their sections will give investors a new depth of understanding about Halliburton’s business, and it will also provide a sense of the high quality of our management team. 
Halliburton has an exceptional global presence. We have a strong oilfield services position in North America, where our customers’ spending is most concentrated. We also have a large presence outside North America, which accounted for over 40 percent of the ESG growth in revenue in 2005. Growing this international business is a strategic priority. ESG management focuses on working with customers around the world to ensure we have the appropriate infrastructure, equipment, and people to grow with their needs and to deliver superior performance worldwide. 
For the year 2005, ESG posted revenue growth of 26 percent and operating income growth of 80 percent. Our operating margins were nearly 23 percent, compared to 16 percent in 2004. 
We believe ESG’s ability to sustain growth in revenue, operating income, and margin is indicated by our customers’ plans to increase spending on exploration and development, and by their demonstrated confidence in the quality and value of our services. Continued demand growth for oilfield services should also allow for further price increases for our services in 2006. In addition, all four divisions are doing an excellent job of controlling costs in a growth market, and we are increasing our capital budget for ESG by nearly 40 percent to meet the anticipated growth in demand. 
KBR delivered four profitable quarters in 2005, posting $498 million in operating income. The Energy and Chemicals Division moved from executing the final stages of difficult legacy projects to newly awarded projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction plants and the emerging gas-to-liquids market, which we collectively refer to as gas monetization. In 2005, KBR won major gas monetization projects in Angola, Australia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Qatar, and Yemen, and we expect more awards for 2006. These projects helped the division produce operating margins in excess of 6 percent, an unprecedented figure. The Government and Infrastructure Division also posted operating income and margin gains, as our work in the Middle East received high grades from our customer, reflecting the quality of our services. 
We achieved several important goals that contributed to our strong performance. Working capital management and efficient deployment of our assets helped grow our overall return on capital employed to more than 20 percent in 2005. We had also set a goal of achieving a debt to total capitalization ratio below 35 percent by mid-2006, as we had incurred significant debt in prior years to fund our asbestos and silica settlements. We beat that deadline with a ratio of 33 percent at the end of 2005. 
Our strong cash flow will help us continue to grow through increased capital spending and acquisitions. We also recently announced our intention to directly return more cash to our shareholders, with a 20 percent increase in our quarterly dividend and through the introduction of a share repurchase program. 
There are many more individuals who deserve recognition than there is space available to mention them here. We want to emphasize the central point of this letter: We are celebrating our most successful year ever because we have been able to empower the talents, initiative, and spirit of Halliburton people from diverse backgrounds. This has been the goal of our recruiting, training, and organizational structure. 
We have invested heavily in our people, and we will continue to do so. One focus of our recruitment is nationalization – having a staff primarily from the region where they work. Our experience has shown the effectiveness of this approach in building long-term relationships with customers and communities. 
A measure of success is the way our customers relate to frontline Halliburton employees – the men and women who design the job, deliver the services, and create the value. They are the frac crew working in the Rockies, the mud logger on a platform offshore West Africa, and the people providing hot meals and clean laundry to uniformed personnel in the Middle East. 
Halliburton’s frontline representatives have always been the source of our competitive advantage because they inspire confidence and trust from the people they serve. That’s why the sight of a red truck coming over the horizon is welcomed around the world. 
And Halliburton people have been good neighbors in the hundreds of communities where we live and work. 2005
was a year of great challenges in disaster relief, and our employees met those needs with their own initiative in country after country. They volunteered their time to travel to areas in Asia affected by the tsunami so they could help people there. They also responded immediately after the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico with donations and services, and when an earthquake struck Pakistan, Halliburton employees from around the world pitched in to help provide relief. 
We strive to be good stewards of Halliburton’s brand name and the financial capital that shareholders have placed with us, and this report will show what we have done. We are grateful for the confidence that our customers and investors have placed in Halliburton, and we look forward to reporting on a successful 2006 next year.

Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2006,"Dear Fellow Shareholders: 
In 2006, we made a commitment to put our full energies into becoming the preferred energy services provider. 
In November, KBR completed the initial public offering of approximately 19 percent of its common stock.
We expect the full separation to be completed early
in 2007, enabling us to focus entirely on being a pure energy services company. 
During 2006, the Energy Services Group posted some impressive numbers. We achieved revenue of $13.0 billion – revenue growth of 28 percent year over year. Our operating income margin was more than 26 percent, and our operating income grew more than 48 percent. These numbers reflect record revenue, operating income and operating income margin in each of the divisions within the ESG: Production Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling and Formation Evaluation, and Digital and Consulting Solutions. 
Eastern Hemisphere 
Beginning in early 2006, we started moving rapidly to 
expand our already significant presence in the Eastern Hemisphere. This focus included traditional markets, such as the Middle East and the North Sea, and developing markets 
for us, such as Southeast Asia and North Africa. With a firm commitment to investments in infrastructure, capital and technology as the cornerstones of our growth, we saw exceptional results: revenue growth of 27 percent year over year. 
The Middle East is a significant growth area for Halliburton. One of our big successes last year was winning the contract to provide oilfield services to Saudi Aramco for the development of the Khurais Field. Almost all of our product service lines will be utilized in drilling and completing more than 300 wells during the term of this project. 
Pressure pumping services continue to play a key role in our Russian market. In fact, in November, we signed a contract with Rosneft-YNG for the provision of hydraulic fracturing services in Siberia’s Priobskoye Field. We also recently introduced in Russia our pinpoint stimulation technologies, which accurately place multiple stimulation treatments in horizontal and vertical wellbores. 
Another recent win in the Tyumen region of Russia is a three-year contract that will utilize products and services from our Cementing, Baroid Fluid Services, Sperry Drilling Services and Security DBS Drill Bits lines. 
Western Hemisphere 
Complementing our performance in the Eastern Hemisphere are our Western Hemisphere operations, which include Canada, the United States and Latin America. We posted revenue growth of 29 percent year over year. 
Among the new technologies we have applied to the Canadian market are Sperry’s StrataSteer® 3DTM system, which was recognized by World Oil magazine as the Best Data Visualization Package, and our patented Geo-Pilot® rotary steerable system. The StrataSteer 3D system, coupled with our real-time decision-making capabilities, gives us a decided edge in in-situ heavy oil development, a high-growth sector 
Our pinpoint stimulation services, in particular, have helped to revitalize mature fields and have proved to be a true game-changer in layered structures representative of unconventional natural gas basins in the United States. Revenue from these technologies, which include our CobraMax® and SurgiFrac® fracturing services, increased 57 percent over 2005. 
Another emerging technology is Baroid’s new diesel-based drilling fluid called IntegradeTM. It is based on our ACCOLADE® technology, which helps lower overall well construction costs by increasing penetration rates. We saw a 90-percent increase in the number of Integrade jobs performed in the fourth quarter of 2006 in deep U.S. well applications. 
Our Latin America region demonstrated the value of a diverse portfolio by posting year-over-year revenue growth.
In Argentina, innovation in data acquisition, using magnetic resonance measurements with the MRIL®-PrimeTM technology, helped clients to better identify heavy crude hydrocarbons compared with previous methods. On the other hand, conductivity- endurance SandWedge® technologies helped improve the production of wells over longer periods of time. 
Our Focus on Technology 
We’ve made considerable strides the past few years in our real-time decision-making capabilities, both in our ability to assist our clients in setting up and operating Real Time Decision Centers and in improving our own operational efficiency. Overall, our real-time jobs grew more than 400 percent from 2003 to 2006. 
Our plan for the Digital Asset – the real-time collaborative environment to model, measure and optimize reservoir performance – positions us to gain competitive advantage. This seamless transfer, management and interpretation of exploration and production data between our product service lines and our customers are integral parts of our overall growth strategy. 
We have just completed construction of a major remote operating center in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia. From this center, experienced engineers monitor and operate complex drilling and geological sensing packages deep below the earth and hundreds of miles away, helping to steer the well through the reservoir and improve the efficiency of field operations. This capability is a sign of more widespread use of remote operations centers and is an important step in enabling Sperry to achieve its goal of performing more than 25 percent of its jobs remotely by 2010. 
Our commitment to long-term strategic technology and research aimed at meeting our customers’ and the world’s future needs is evidenced by our newest global research and development center. Focusing on our Fluid Systems and Production Optimization divisions, the Pune, India, center will open in the second quarter of 2007. Another technology center, which will be anchored by products from our Drilling and Formation Evaluation division, will open soon after that in Singapore. These new centers – along with our six existing centers located in the U.K., Canada and the U.S. – will further globalize our technology platform and leverage the worldwide talent pool. 
In addition, we have a strategy in place for diversifying our manufacturing footprint in coordination with that of technology. It makes good business sense to source material and manufactured components closer to the work. In doing so, we will take advantage of both our manufacturing reach and our global supplier base. 
We had a very good year in 2006. We measure our success in a number of ways, but we know that a truly successful company not only wins in the marketplace, but it also leaves a positive imprint in the communities where we live and work. 
Our employees are to be commended for their outstanding performance, attention to safety and service quality, and dedication to the success of our company, as well as for their service to their communities and goodwill toward their neighbors. 
We are excited about our future and the many opportunities that await us the world over. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2007,"In 2007, Halliburton posted record revenue and earnings for the third consecutive year. 
Our largest source of expansion is and will continue to be in our international markets. 
Our financial performance reflects the execution of a robust growth strategy based on fundamental factors that are shaping the future. According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the industry produced roughly a trillion barrels of oil in the last century and a half. It is estimated that the world will use its second trillion barrels during the next 35 years. The next trillion barrels will be characterized by smaller, more complex reservoirs in more challenging and remote environments, and hydrocarbons will be increasingly unconventional in nature. 
We are well positioned at the forefront of these trends, which will drive our international growth and at increased levels of service intensity. Our accelerated investments in our people and infrastructure, along with a well-integrated technology strategy and portfolio, will support our global growth efforts. 
Service intensity grows with reservoir complexity. 
Increasing reservoir complexity has created a long-term trend toward greater service intensity – additional and more complex services applied to each rig drilling or well serviced – and this trend drove Halliburton’s growth in all regions in 2007. 
Internationally, where many of our most advanced technologies – including directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, completions and wireline – are leading our growth, our revenue per rig has grown by more than 30 percent in the last two years, giving us the confidence that strong international growth will continue in the future. 
The most significant development in North America is the trend toward exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbon resources such as tight gas development. This has translated to robust growth, not only for our traditional stimulation businesses but also for our directional drilling and horizontal well-completion technologies, which has resulted in a more balanced U.S. product and service portfolio. 
Infrastructure investments support our international growth strategy.
We have accelerated our investments in people, facilities and technology to take advantage of international growth opportunities. 
Building a dynamic workforce with the expertise to execute at Halliburton’s high standard of service quality is critical to our international expansion. In 2007, this workforce grew to more
than 50,000. It comprises over 100 nationalities, with the majority working in their home countries. We now have 12 training centers worldwide, integrating new workers and advancing the skills of our existing workforce, building upon their professional and technical competencies. 
A comprehensive global supply chain capable of supporting our planned growth is also a necessity. In 2007, we opened four new regional manufacturing facilities in Asia and Latin America, designed to create new regional supply chains to complement our current worldwide sourcing capability. These new centers will create a more responsive organization for our international customers while building regional supply networks that support local economies. 
We are also making our research and development efforts more geographically diverse. Last year, we opened a technology center in Pune, India – our first outside of North America and Europe. 
There, PhD-level scientists and engineers collaborate
to advance our global expertise by focusing on those technologies that will advance our production enhancement, drilling fluids and cementing product lines. 
Integrated technology strategy leads the industry. 
We are meeting the challenges of increasing reservoir recovery with new technologies that address the industry’s most important needs: reducing uncertainty in developing the reservoir, providing precise well placement and optimizing reservoir drainage for improved recovery 
rates, and creating new ways of increasing the efficiency of the development process. 
Our Completion and Production Division is continually expanding its technology portfolio, creating solutions to address the recovery of conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons. We are integrating production and completion services to produce a higher level of control and effectiveness, enhancing the production from our customers’ new and old reservoirs. Our innovative approaches in providing solutions for ultra-deepwater and complex well intervention are strengthening our completion service market position. 
Through our Drilling and Evaluation Division, we are delivering next-generation reservoir data management techniques and integrated interpretation and visualization technologies to provide our customers with enhanced exploration and development tools. Developments in 
our sampling and deep-reading imaging sensors reduce positional and geological uncertainty and help illuminate reservoirs for our customers. New drilling systems
are providing improved reliability in complex wells and high-pressure, high-temperature environments. 
Today, we produce and share digital data, communicate this data in real time, and then use it to create models for simulation and, ultimately, designing solutions. 
The future will bring new sensor technologies and capabilities that enable better, faster decisions. 
Our leadership in Real Time Operations (RTO) services is a driving force in this strategy. Engineers and geoscientists monitor and control remote well construction and production operations from centers that may be located several hundred miles from the wellsite, offering the ability to send instructions directly to downhole tools and receive real-time data streams in return. In 2007, we performed nearly 18,000 real-time jobs – double the number from 2006 – and we expect this number to expand significantly as we help transform the way the industry works. 
We are now building on the foundation of RTO expertise
to serve a wider scope of customer challenges, specifically increasing reservoir recovery. We are expanding the RTO concept into what we call the Digital AssetTM – a real-time collaborative environment to model, measure and optimize our customers’ assets. Our consulting expertise and reservoir knowledge will help customers improve the performance of their assets. 
The evolution of the Digital Asset will become a source of significant competitive advantage for us in 2008 and beyond as it transforms the ways in which we anticipate solutions to industry challenges. 
Growth strategy yields strong financial results. 
We are confident that our accelerated investments in
our people and infrastructure for international growth, and our well-integrated technology strategy, will increase service intensity over time and continue to set us apart
in the industry. 
These elements are delivering increasing financial returns and strong international growth rates. Operating income has increased 62 percent in the last two years, with 58 percent of that increase coming from international activity. Return on shareholders’ equity grew to 35 percent in 2007. 
We are well positioned to play a pivotal role in meeting the increasingly complex needs of the industry, and we look forward to that work with confidence and enthusiasm. 
Finally, we owe our success to the dedication and creativity of our employees – our faces of energy – who continue to invent new technologies, deliver outstanding service quality and contribute to the life of their communities. It starts with them – they are our greatest source of competitive advantage. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2008,"UNCOMPROMISING FOCUS 
In 2008, we achieved the highest oilfield revenues in our history as customers turned to Halliburton to help them meet their project challenges and production goals. Halliburton technologies enabled operators to develop complex reservoirs in areas such as deep water, tight gas, shale and heavy oil. As a result, both of our operating divisions experienced double-digit growth. 
The Drilling and Evaluation Division continued to expand its product portfolio, fueled by commercialization of key technologies that help customers drill more efficiently and evaluate the potential of their reservoirs more effectively. Division revenue grew 21 percent in 2008 and now represents 46 percent of Halliburton’s total revenue, performance that was led by the increased success in international markets of our suite of rotary steerable tools and measurement solutions used in directional and horizontal drilling applications. 
Leadership market positions helped Halliburton’s Completion and Production Division deliver 18 percent revenue growth year-over-year. The development of unconventional gas remained the most significant onshore growth trend in North America and, increasingly, in international markets. Furthermore, in deepwater, our customers valued Halliburton’s innovative completion and stimulation technologies for their ability to increase productivity and efficiency in these challenging environments. 
At the center of Halliburton’s growth is a focus on aggressively expanding international business while strengthening our successful North American franchise. Halliburton is bringing solutions to the most challenging projects, from the remote corners of Siberia to the deep waters off the coast of Brazil. Halliburton grew its international business 22 percent year-over-year, led by significant growth across Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. 
We continued to develop responsive supply-chain and manufacturing networks to support our growing international business. In 2008, we opened additional manufacturing centers in Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico. We also opened a new technology center in Singapore and an improved research and development laboratory in Norway. Collectively, these investments enhance our ability to respond quickly to our customers’ needs in their areas of operation. 
Halliburton increased its level of technology investment in 2008 and today leads the industry with a portfolio of more than 7,000 patents. We also strengthened our platform of technologies and services through complementary acquisitions such as WellDynamics, Pinnacle Technologies Inc., KSI and Protech Centerform. 
Our 2008 results are evidence of our uncompromising focus on delivering solid performance and innovative solutions to our global customers. For the past four years, Halliburton has posted record oilfield revenue and earnings, yet has remained disciplined in its fiscal approach. We closed 2008 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, giving us a financial platform that will allow us the flexibility to meet the challenges and opportunities of the years ahead. 
Navigating turbulent waters 
Since 1981, the oil and gas markets have experienced five unique cycles that varied in depth and duration. 2009 brings a new set of challenges as the downturn in the global economy negatively impacts the short-term outlook for the industry. The tightening of capital markets and ensuing global recession has depressed commodity prices and forced customers to constrict their capital expenditures to enable them to operate within their cash flows. This has created a more pronounced weakening in industry fundamentals than we have experienced in past cycles. 
Drawing on experience gained in previous downturns, we are responding to temper the impact of the activity decline on our financial performance by taking the following actions: 
•	Protect market position – Halliburton is committed to protecting our strong North American franchise while expanding our international position. Halliburton remains well aligned with primary integrated, national oil companies and large independent customers in key geologic basins around the globe. 
•	Maintain technology differentiation – Halliburton’s portfolio of technologies and services is uniquely positioned to drive efficiency through innovation throughout the well life cycle. We will invest in technologies that will strengthen our competitive position. 
•	Create competitive advantage – The comprehensive breadth of our portfolio enables us
to provide integrated solutions, from well planning through production, that drive technical, logistical and cost efficiencies within large projects. 
•	Reduce input costs – Nearly two-thirds of our overall costs are in the materials that support our daily business. We will leverage our supply-chain structure to improve global sourcing availability and lower supplier costs across our global network. Though headcount reductions will be made in locations experiencing significant activity declines, our goal is to minimize the number of employees affected to avoid high recruitment and training costs when industry fundamentals improve. 
These actions, along with our strong financial position, will provide Halliburton with the flexibility to help position us for the market’s eventual recovery. 
Despite the short-term obstacles, the long-term prospects for the industry are robust. For example, the International Energy Agency forecasts a 45 percent increase in energy demand by 2030 fueled by accelerated growth in China, India and the Middle East. Meanwhile, many of the world’s largest fields have passed their production peak and are in decline. Globally, decline curves for oil wells are estimated to be over 5 percent, with decline curves for gas fields in North America estimated to be over 25 percent annually. While these natural decline curves pose a significant challenge to our customers, Halliburton is well placed to provide the technology and expertise to support them in this endeavor. 
INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION 
With employees working in over 70 countries, Halliburton people continue to gain experience from working in the most challenging reservoirs and environments around the globe. Our technology focus draws on this experience and that of our customers in solving the most significant challenges in the economic exploitation of oil and gas resources. 
Reducing uncertainty and increasing precision
in complex reservoirs
Reservoirs are becoming smaller and more complex. Reducing geologic and economic uncertainty is a key priority for our customers, especially in areas such as deep water. Our modeling and interpretation expertise, coupled with new developments to improve evaluation of prospective reservoirs, will help our customers better exploit their portfolios. 
Improving net recovery factors from old and new fields 
In the average reservoir, our customers typically recover only 35 percent of oil in place. Halliburton is working to develop new technologies, including nano-scale materials, that help better illuminate the reservoir and enable improved oil recovery. 
Making the unconventional conventional 
Unconventional resources will be a crucial component of the energy mix of the future. Recent technology developments have enabled unconventional gas to take a significant role in global gas development. Halliburton’s leading solutions in data gathering, fracture mapping and completion systems assist operators in economically unlocking the value of these reservoirs. 
Reliably accessing deeply buried reservoirs 
Significant resources are located in deeply buried reservoirs, characterized by high-temperature and high-pressure regimes, which to this point have been challenging to exploit economically. In close association with our customers, we are developing important technologies that can provide the needed insight to make drilling and evaluating these hostile environments more productive. 
Integrating capabilities to drive efficiency 
Increasing efficiency is a key business driver in challenging economic environments. Building on Halliburton’s market-leading, real-time expertise, the Digital AssetTM helps us to integrate
the right technologies with the most relevant real-time data to create a customized asset solution. Digital Asset solutions
often involve the delivery of multiple products and services as
a total system solution. 
To customers looking for a step change in well performance and cost efficiency for large projects, we leverage our broad array
of services to offer an integrated solution from well planning to completion, fostering an asset-specific approach. At present, nearly 30 percent of our total revenues are generated by multi- service contracts. We believe that this percentage will grow and will be an important source of competitive advantage as customers turn to robust solutions to exploit more complex assets. 
DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE 
Today we stand on a platform of solid financial performance,
a balanced portfolio of industry-leading products and services,
and a global infrastructure. We will continue our focus on expanding our geographic footprint, bringing superior service delivery and technical expertise to our customers around the globe. 
Incorporating sustainable processes and technologies into our daily operational activities is a key priority in addressing the vital issues we face in the global communities where we work. For example,
in many parts of the world, fresh water is becoming an increasingly precious resource. In 2008, Halliburton introduced a new fluid system that can function with a wide variety of produced water, eliminating the need for fresh water. You can learn more about 
how Halliburton is dedicated to the innovations needed to bring sustainable solutions to locations around the world in our 2008 Sustainability Report published as a companion document to our Annual Report. 
While Halliburton has good insight into the supply dynamics
of the global energy industry, the timing of the recovery of the global economy and resulting demand for hydrocarbons in the short term is less clear. Regardless of this challenge, Halliburton’s strengths are evident. Halliburton has the unique ability to foster integration and innovation across our technology portfolio to deliver robust solutions that help our customers reduce costs
and improve production. 
Our leadership in technology, the breadth of our offerings, and our relentless focus on quality make us confident that customers around the world will continue to depend on Halliburton for the ingenuity and expertise to help them meet their most difficult challenges.

Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2009,"TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS: 
2009 was a year of unprecedented challenges as the global economy faced widespread recession leading to declines in energy investment. Amid this climate of economic uncertainty, Halliburton rose to the challenge and increased the strength of its global franchise. 
In response to the global recession, demand for oil and natural gas weakened, reducing global drilling activity and causing customers to change their priorities. North America experienced a shift in the resource mix. For the first time, the number of horizontal wells exceeded the number of vertical wells drilled, as operators focused on unconventional basins, such as tight natural gas and shale reservoirs. Operators have increased their production rates by leveraging “fit-for-purpose” technology to drill longer horizontal laterals and increase stimulation intensity. 
International drilling activity experienced an average 8 percent decline as the economic slowdown increased the amount of spare capacity, discouraging investment in new upstream projects. In contrast, deepwater markets were resilient due to their larger scale and long-term capital commitments. 
Globally, operators migrated from focusing on individual supplier costs toward reducing total project execution costs. To achieve this objective, customers purchased large packages of services spanning well construction and completion activities. Our broad portfolio of offerings and our ability to deliver integrated services make us uniquely qualified to meet this increased demand for comprehensive solutions. 
A DifferentiAteD StrAtegy While short-term activity declined, we continued our focus on positioning for growth and generating superior returns. We maintained our investment in capital equipment and infrastructure to strengthen our global franchise in key markets. With the increased volatility of the financial markets, we also took steps to maintain our financial flexibility by managing costs, increasing our cash reserves, and protecting our credit rating. 
In North America, we opened new service centers in unconventional basins such as the Williston, Marcellus, and Haynesville shale plays. In addition, we deployed customized technology such as shale formation evaluation tools and specialized stimulation units built to increase reliability and efficiency. 
In international markets, we continued to expand our footprint. We opened a Sperry Drilling facility in Nizhnevartovsk, Russia, that includes the first Remote Operations Center to provide real-time operations support for geosteering and drilling optimization in Western Siberia. In Libya, we opened a new state-of-the-art base camp to support our expanded product service line offerings. Additionally, in Angola, we launched the Stim Star Angola stimulation vessel, which is specialized to work in difficult sea conditions. 
executing to PlAn, Achieving reSultS We executed our strategy through several key initiatives. Most importantly, we focused on protecting and expanding our market share. While markets remained competitive, we expanded the scope of our services for many global customers. We also maintained our investment in technology and people, further ensuring the competitive strength of our future service offerings. 
We leveraged the breadth of our portfolio to offer packaged services that capitalized on our reservoir knowledge and leading technology. Using this model, we managed the integration of services from planning through execution to deliver greater efficiency and lower project costs. Through these initiatives, Halliburton has strengthened its share across all major product service lines with significant gains in testing, drill bits, and directional drilling. 
The successful execution of our strategy is reflected in our financial results. Even at the most difficult point of the year, we posted returns above the peer average, which will serve the company well as the industry comes out of the downturn. In addition, we generated positive cash flow and ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and marketable securities. 
Moving forwArD through growth As we move forward, we will continue to execute our strategy. We will leverage our balanced portfolio of industry-leading technologies to continue growing our international business and expand our presence in underserved markets. China, Iraq, and Russia will provide growth opportunities in 2010 as energy investment increases. Deepwater markets, such as Brazil and Angola, will increase the demand for complex drilling and completion solutions. Deepwater markets will remain strong, as over 30 deepwater rigs are forecasted to enter into the global market in 2010. We will also maintain our heavy investment in capital equipment and technology. Finally, we will remain financially flexible, as we continue to focus on our cash flows by managing working capital and our cost structure. 
We believe in the strength of the long-term fundamentals of our business. Our customers will continue to pursue more complex reservoirs, expecting greater efficiency and ingenuity. Our focus on developing technology to optimize well construction and completions as complementary systems will differentiate our solutions for these challenging reservoirs. 
We will continue to manage through this downturn by focusing on expanding our market position, reducing input costs, and delivering the superior execution and quality that our customers have come to expect. We will continue to push boundaries by deploying our resources where activity will be robust in the recovery, enabling us to retain the share gains we have experienced and to accelerate our growth.

Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2010,"TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS: 
When we say that outstanding performance is a part of our DNA at Halliburton, we have the results to stand behind that statement. We uniquely delivered superior growth, margins, and shareholder returns compared to our primary competitors. 
During 2010, Halliburton achieved revenue growth of 22 percent. Operating income expanded 51 percent over 2009, and the Company generated market-leading returns on capital employed of 15 percent. This performance is notable in light of the moderated recovery of the broad economy from the recent global recession. North America experienced a dramatic recovery in activity. International markets commenced a gradual ascent as large customers rationalized spending and deferred project startups. As we look toward the coming year, we anticipate that our international markets will continue to repair, led by the revival of offshore and deepwater activity. We believe the industry is on the verge of another up-cycle, and Halliburton is positioned with the right technology in the right markets to capitalize on this growth. 
Our 2010 results reflect the successful execution of our strategy to utilize our broad global capabilities to enhance our market share position. Going forward, we will focus on the world’s fastest growing oil service market segments, including unconventional reservoirs, deepwater, and mature fields. 
UNCONVENTIONAl OPPORTUNITy Led by opportunities in oil- and liquids-rich basins, North America experi- enced a resurgence of activity with a 45 percent increase in the United States land rig count. Oil and gas operators continued to explore and develop unconventional reservoirs in areas such as the Haynesville, Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Marcellus plays, leading to a 66 percent increase in horizontal drilling activity year-over-year. The U.S. domestic market experienced a structural shift away from natural gas activity and toward oil-directed activity, which increased 83 percent year-over-year. 
Halliburton has become the leader in the development of unconventional reservoirs through the provision of its innovative proprietary technologies to the market, along with improved process efficiencies and expert reservoir knowledge. A superior delivery platform is another key element of the Halliburton DNA. Our ability to execute in these complex basins provides better economics for 
our customers. 
By leveraging our reservoir knowledge, we created life-of-the-well solutions to drive down drilling and completion times and to increase operational efficiency. For example, in the Bakken play, we were the leader in developing a hybrid completion solution combining conventional methods with sliding-sleeve completion tools, resulting in our ability to complete fracture stages 40 percent faster. Delivering this kind of innovation and efficiency is what sets our solutions apart. 
Our strategy in leading the North American unconventional market is to provide the services and technologies that allow us to deliver the lowest cost per unit of production for our customers. With this in mind, we are reinventing our service delivery model for well stimulation services. We are developing technology to dramatically increase the reliability of our equipment and reduce maintenance costs. In addition, advances in modeling have united the pet- rophysical domain and field operations, making production enhancement at Halliburton a multidisciplinary applied science that only a fully integrated company can deliver. Through the use of microseismic, reservoir modeling, and a proprietary complex fracture model, we can assist our customers in delivering the most effective completions for a given well, and also predict how to increase production from an entire field. 
Unconventional resources have changed the landscape of the North American market, but going forward we see an even greater opportunity in the international unconventional markets. Only 25 percent of the world’s unconventional reserves are located in North America. The remaining 75 percent of these resources lie in international markets. China, Australia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Colombia, and Russia are emerging unconventional markets that will become new frontiers for customers looking to build on their success in North America. We are well positioned to support them in the development of their global assets. 
dEEPwATER INNOVATION During the last two years, 139 successful deepwater exploratory wells were drilled, marking a significant expansion into new basins – many in areas where there had been limited previous exploration activity, including Ghana, the Philippines, and Mozambique. As a result of these successes, capital spending on deepwater projects is forecast to grow at approximately 13 percent over the next three years, with projects expanding into relatively untapped markets such as Australia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea. 
In all regions, customers are drilling deeper and in more challenging environments, which translates into growing levels of service intensity. In the future, deepwater wells will become significantly deeper, with increased geologic complexity that requires more sophisticated and differentiated technology. 
Halliburton will play a valuable role in developing new technological innovations and best practices to help customers operate safely and efficiently in these challenging environments. This year, we commercialized several key innovations for the deepwater market. Landmark Software and Services released DecisionSpace® Desktop technology, which is the next-generation software offering geosciences-interpretation and earth-modeling capa- bilities. Developed in close collaboration with Statoil, this product streamlines upstream technology workflows and sets new standards by enabling distributed, multi-user teams to work in a common workspace, leading to more efficient and informed decision-making. Building on our leadership in deepwater completions, our latest innovation, the ESTMZTM (Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone) gravel pack system, has no equal. An extremely efficient sand-control solution for sub-salt deepwater projects, it can potentially decrease the time to complete a deepwater well by 42 days, saving customers up to $30 million in rig time. Another industry first that’s particularly relevant in high-cost deepwater environments is the GeoTap® IDS sensor, which enables customers to take fluid samples in real time during the drilling process to enhance reservoir characterization, with significant time and cost savings. 
IMPACTING THE dEClINE CURVE The oil service industry has historically focused much of its energy on the front end of the exploration and production value chain, including exploration, appraisal, and primary development, with insufficient attention paid to assisting our customers in managing production declines in older fields. We believe many older, more mature fields offer economical opportunities for redevelopment. The solution to impacting the decline curve depends on efficiency and economy. Customers will look to service providers that have the broad capabilities to deliver increased production from these fields – and that can add value to 
their asset portfolios. 
There are currently 1.5 million producing wells on the planet, with another 90,000 wells drilled every year. The average well needs to be worked over every three to five years to maintain acceptable levels of production. This creates significant opportunities for Halliburton, as many of these mature fields were devel- oped with yesterday’s technology. Today, access to a greater amount of geological, geophysical, and production data, combined with current technology, enables us to significantly improve the overall economics of these fields. State-owned and international oil companies alike are looking to use updated methodologies to reinvigorate the life of their mature fields, making this an excellent growth market for us. 
With more than 500 technical consultants across the world who have extensive expertise in geosciences and engineering, coupled with the added production expertise from the recently completed acquisition of Boots & Coots, Halliburton is the largest well-intervention company in the world, with all the required components to fully address the underserved mature fields market. 
lOOkING AHEAd Our growth in the coming years will be fueled by global opportunities to deliver services and technology to developing unconventional reservoirs, deepwater environments, and mature fields. We are placing a significant amount of focus on these three high-growth areas, and we are committed to spending $3 billion this year to invest in our business, infrastructure, and global supply chain to position us to continue to outgrow our competition. We are also committed to maintaining our North American margin leadership and compressing the international margin gap with our leading competitor. 
Halliburton has made strategic investments and aligned with the right customers in the right markets; as a result, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the expected upturn in the energy cycle. We are not resting on the laurels of our outstanding financial and operating performance of the past year. Instead, we are investing in the technologies, people, and processes that will allow us to continue to deliver superior growth, superior margins, and superior returns for our shareholders. It is in our DNA.

Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2011,"TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS: We are very proud to report that 2011 was a highly successful year for our Company. Increased demand for our services and solid execution drove record revenues of $24.8 billion and operating income of $4.7 billion. We achieved return on average capital employed of 19 percent, revenue growth of 38 percent and operating income growth of 57 percent. Our growth, margins and returns in 2011 were superior to the financial results of our primary competitors. The foundation of our successful strategy, based on leveraging three key market segments to drive superior growth, remains unchanged. We will continue to diligently pursue opportunities in unconventional plays, deepwater projects and mature fields. Leading in Unconventional Plays Our technology leadership played a significant role in unconventional fields in 2011. We introduced our new RapidSuite™ sliding sleeve system, which provides our customers with a dramatic increase in efficiency in the completion of horizontal unconventional reservoirs. We continued to deploy our CleanSuite™ technologies in 2011, a group of products and services designed to reduce the use of chemicals and water in hydraulic fracturing operations. The CleanSuite system represents our commitment to responsible energy development. In the North America unconventional market, we have made great progress in deploying elements of our “Frac of the Future” strategic initiative to improve our capital and operational efficiency, such as our ADP™ advanced dry polymer blenders and SandCastle® proppant storage systems. Additionally, we are rolling out our first series of Q10™ pumps, which have demonstrated significant reliability and maintenance advantages in field testing over our current fleet, which is already generally considered to be the best in the industry. These new technologies are also delivering improvements in our environmental performance. As the industry leader in unconventional shale plays, we performed the first shale fracture treatments in numerous countries around the globe, including Argentina, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Poland. Furthermore, customer consulting agreements have given us an opportunity to screen some 150 unconventional worldwide basins and perform over 60 detailed studies allowing us to enhance our understanding of global shale resources. Making Deepwater Advancements In 2011, we broke ground at the construction site of our new technology center at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Technology Park. This groundbreaking event represents a milestone in the Technology Collaboration Agreement signed in 2009 between Halliburton and Petrobras for the purpose of providing deepwater research and technology development in Brazil and around the world. We continued to invest in our deepwater business in 2011. Our wireline team advanced technology in deepwater, setting a new world record for hostile pressure testing and sampling operations. In addition, our Sperry Drilling product service line further solidified its leadership position in high-temperature drilling applications with its unique high-temperature motors and SOLAR™ Geo-Pilot® high-temperature rotary steerable system, which are unmatched in the industry today.
During the year, we secured key deepwater contract wins in East Africa, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, China and Brazil, as well as other markets. We opened three new field offices in East Africa, setting the foundation for future activity in this important deepwater basin. Our outstanding service quality continues to be recognized by our customers. We believe that our strengthening market position and service quality reputation will benefit us as newbuild deepwater rigs are deployed in 2012 and beyond. Maximizing Mature-Field Performance In mature fields, our new technologies are allowing our customers to improve their hydrocarbon recovery rates economically. Halliburton’s Boots & Coots product service line offers a unique new service to help clients efficiently perform stimulation and remedial operations to enhance production in very long lateral wells. This PowerReachSM service combines coiled tubing and jointed pipe to deliver gamechanging technology in extended-reach applications. Throughout 2011, we continued to build our capabilities to service mature fields, and we supported that effort with several acquisitions that enable us to broaden the scope of our mature-field offerings. The most significant of these was Multi-Chem, a premier provider of production and completion chemicals focused on production assurance throughout the life of our customers’ wells. This acquisition will enable us to deliver additional value to our customers and shareholders as we expand the global footprint of this product line. Building Relationships, Delivering Results Every day, our focus is on delivering results for our customers, and we believe that our performance was commendable in 2011. As proof of this, Halliburton was selected as one of seven world leaders out of 40 companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, winning Best in Class for Human Capital Development, Standards for Suppliers, Corporate Governance, and Customer Relationship Management. Looking forward, we continue to have a positive outlook for energy demand and related oilfield activity growth as our customers invest in their resources and optimize their development plans focused on increasingly complex projects. As such, we will continue expanding our capabilities and driving efficiency through technology and logistical improvements to enable this growth. Finally, we would like to thank our board of directors, employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders who have enabled Halliburton to reach these new heights.

"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2012,"During 2012, Halliburton continued to execute the successful strategies that have enabled us to double the size of the company
over the past three years and outgrow our competition. Increased demand for our services and solid execution drove record revenues
of $28.5 billion and operating income of $4.2 billion. In addition to industry-leading revenue growth in 2012, Halliburton delivered
return on average capital employed of 15 percent. This was the third consecutive year of superior returns relative to our primary competitors, an achievement which demands a look beneath the surface. 
industry trends benefit Halliburton 
I am optimistic about Halliburton’s ability to create sustainable value for our shareholders and customers. Strengthening world economies are driving steady growth in energy demand, and this is supporting continued investment by our customers. Much of the investment is occurring in the three market segments where Halliburton has concentrated its attention and built deep capabilities over the past several years: unconventional assets; complex deepwater environments; and an increased focus on improving the performance of mature fields. 
leading in unconventional Plays 
In North America, we continue to demonstrate leadership and are committed to delivering the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent produced from our customers’ unconventional wells. With the 2012 release of our “Frac of the Future” program, we elevated our service platform to a higher level of efficiency, providing the most effective and reliable hydraulic fracturing system available today. At the core of this program is a new hydraulic pump, 
the Q-10, which reduces our well site footprint by 20 percent and can be configured to use clean-burning natural gas as a fuel source. This year also saw a shift to downhole innovation in the domains of customized chemistry and new simulation technologies to enhance subsurface understanding. 
Internationally, 2012 was a turning point for the development of unconventional market resources. We expanded our presence in key unconventional markets such as Australia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and China, building our service footprint and establishing basin- oriented technology teams to help our customers develop their assets. As these countries seek to unlock their unconventional assets, Halliburton is using expertise and technology leadership developed in North America to the benefit of our international customers. 
Making Deepwater advances 
Over the last six years, the deepwater rig fleet has grown 40 percent, and the market has expanded beyond the scope of the traditional “golden triangle” – Gulf of Mexico, Brazil
and West Africa – into East Africa, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and other emerging deepwater markets. The growth of deepwater activity spans from exploration and appraisal to development, where we can leverage our core strengths in drilling and formation evaluation, and our leadership in deepwater completions. 
As deepwater production becomes a greater portion of our customers’ portfolios, our reputation for reliability has made us a provider of choice across the globe. We are also seeing the payoff of our recent international infrastructure investments, resulting in leading market positions in deepwater in East Africa, Malaysia and Brazil – three robust markets that accounted for 9 of the top 10 discoveries in 2012. 
Maximizing Mature Field Performance 
Mature fields, those past peak production, demonstrate production declines that are typically estimated to be in excess of 3% per year. In addition, 65% of oil reserves are typically bypassed during production. As a result, our customers place a significant emphasis on the assurance of their production and improvement in recovery rates in their mature fields. This is an area of significant focus for Halliburton, and in 2012 we made investments in the areas of specialty chemicals and artificial lift to strengthen our global capabilities. These investments, along with our Boots & Coots product line, have allowed us to more than double the
size of our mature field business over the last two years. 
We are helping our customers rediscover their reservoirs; providing technology to access bypassed zones and improving the recovery rates of their proven resources. Our global presence in all major oil-producing regions and strong portfolio of capabilities for data acquisition, well diagnosis, intervention and completion, position Halliburton for continued growth in this important arena. 
Expanding Opportunities 
Over the coming year, our business in North America stands to benefit as material cost headwinds experienced in 2012 abate. Bolstered by strengthening offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico, we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in North America. Internationally, robust deepwater activity, growing interest in unconventional resource development and expanding mature field opportunities will provide a diverse platform
for continued growth. I believe we will continue to expand our international operations, building our market share position, strengthening our margins and achieving balance in
our geographic portfolio. 
We have a sound strategy and a track record of exceptional execution. I am optimistic about our future and the expanding global opportunities for Halliburton, and we remain committed to delivering superior growth, margins and returns. We appreciate the support of our shareholders and customers as well as the exceptional contributions of our board of directors, employees and suppliers, all of whom are vital to our success. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2013,"To Our Shareholders, 
At Halliburton, we believe in setting bold goals that stretch our abilities, drive our growth and reflect the long-term prospects for our business. Over the past three years, we grew our deepwater business at double the market rate, tripled the size of our mature fields business, extended our unconventionals leadership and delivered superior returns relative 
to our major competitors. 
Halliburton’s success is rooted in a sound strategy executed by an ambitious management team and a dedicated workforce that is never satisfied with the status quo. We are driven to provide execution certainty, deliver on our commitments and find new ways to increase value for customers. Our strategic focus on deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals has served us well, and these high-growth segments will continue to fuel our growth. 
Deepwater Shows Robust Activity 
Over the past five years, 60 percent of the total volume of all hydrocarbon discoveries were made in deepwater, and licensing activity is at an all-time high. With deepwater activity expanding to all regions of the world, the market is expected to grow 11 percent annually over the next five years. 
The development segment is projected to see the strongest growth over the coming five years – 13 percent per year compared to four percent for exploration. This trend will benefit Halliburton, drawing on our number one position in completions, our integration capabilities and our reputation for execution 
certainty. By leveraging our infrastructure investments, building on our leadership in deepwater development and introducing technologies that maximize production from customer assets, we believe we can continue to outgrow the deepwater market by 25 percent over the next three years. 
Mature Fields Play a Vital Role 
On average, fields that are past their peak represent approximately 60 percent of International Oil Company (IOC) asset portfolios, and their production is estimated to be declining by more than eight percent per year. Compared to capital-intensive new development projects, mature fields can generate attractive returns for our customers and represent an important source 
of cash flow for them. 
Robust demand and a meaningful increase in service intensity has multiplied revenue opportunities for large, integrated
service providers as the market moves from the provision of discrete services to integrated solutions and ultimately to asset management arrangements. Very few service companies have the scale and the service portfolio to compete in this arena, which offers stable, long-term growth with limited capital investment. Our three-year goal is to again triple our mature fields business. 
Unconventionals Market Gains Velocity 
Over the past few years, the North American market shifted its focus from natural gas to liquids. Full-scale development of major unconventionals resource areas like the Permian Basin is now underway for many of our customers, who are striving to achieve the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent to ensure their economic success. We believe Halliburton is ahead of the curve in serving this market by providing the technologies, capabilities and expertise to help our customers meet their objectives in this challenging high velocity environment. 
We have made significant investments to ensure that we have
the correct tools and capabilities to deliver better producing wells, built faster, at lower cost and with reduced risk. With the industry’s most advanced delivery platform, we address both sides of the value equation, offering cost savings through superior efficiency plus advanced technologies and software that reduce uncertainty and improve production. We plan to extend our leadership position in North America and leverage our expertise to capture opportunities in emerging international unconventional markets. 
Delivering on Our Commitments 
We are pleased with our operational performance in these key markets. However, the ultimate measure of success for our shareholders is how well we deliver on our financial commitments to produce superior growth, margins and returns. During 2013, we grew our revenue to a new record of $29.4 billion. We maintained market leadership in North America and outgrew our primary competitors in international markets, which now represent 
48 percent of company revenue. International infrastructure investments have supported our significant growth in these markets and provide us a platform for future revenue and margin growth. 
During 2013, we demonstrated our strong commitment to delivering superior shareholder returns and reiterated our continued confidence in the strength of our business outlook. In addition to raising our dividend twice, for a total payout increase of 67 percent over our 2012 quarterly dividend rate, we repurchased approximately $4.4 billion, or 10 percent, of our outstanding common shares.
We have been, and will continue to be, relentlessly focused on delivering best-in-class returns. 
Extending the Momentum 
Through consistent execution of a proven strategy, we have built a solid foundation on which to generate future growth and the momentum to drive it forward. The established market leader in North America, we continue to expand our global footprint to address emerging growth opportunities in international markets. 
We recognize the vital role our stakeholders play in our success. We greatly appreciate the confidence our shareholders and customers continue to show in Halliburton and the exceptional contributions of our board of directors, employees and suppliers. After reading this report and discovering what drives us, we are confident that you will share our optimism and enthusiasm about the road ahead for Halliburton. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2014,"Halliburton is committed to big thinking, focused execution and outperforming our peers in any market environment. During 2014, we once again delivered industry- leading growth and returns by executing on our key strategies around unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. While 2015 is shaping up to be a challenging year, we have what it takes to outperform through the down cycle and emerge a stronger company. Our strategies have worked, they are working, and 
we intend to stay the course. 
During 2014, we produced record revenue and operating income
for the total company, as well as revenue records for our North America, Europe/Africa/CIS and Middle East/Asia Pacific regions. We also set revenue records in
both of our divisions and across
12 of our 13 product service lines. With an unwavering focus on best- in-class returns, we returned a
third of our 2014 cash flow from operations to shareholders, raising our quarterly dividend by 20 percent and repurchasing $800 million of our common stock. 
Strength Across Cycles 
The year clearly represented another peak in what has always been a cyclical industry. A decline in commodity prices late in 2014 led customers to begin reducing their capital budgets, which translates into a challenging environment for service companies. On the positive side, we have built a position of strength; we have been through these cycles before, and we know what we need to do. 
We always take a two-pronged approach. First, we will control what we can control, defend our market position, and live within our cash flow. We will size our operations to market demand and take the necessary steps to reduce input costs. Second, we look beyond the cycle, capitalize on market opportunities and continue with our strategic initiatives, which position us for even greater success in the future. 
Building on Our Advantages 
Strong customer relationships, exceptional service quality and differentiating technologies matter
in every environment. We are proud to work with many of the world’s premiere operators. In addition to holding acreage in the sweet spots
of reservoirs, they leverage technology to achieve the best economics in 
their assets and have the financial resources to work through cycles. 
We look beyond the cycle, capitalize
on market opportuni- ties and continue with our strategic initiatives, emerging as a stronger com- pany when the mar- ket comes back. 
We maintain these relationships by partnering with our customers on solutions tailored to their needs and the prevailing market conditions.
Our leadership in efficient execution reduces non-productive time and lowers the cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our customers. In an industry characterized by large, com- plex shale wells in North America, daunting technical challenges offshore and a growing base of integrated pro- jects on the international stage, we believe that superior execution and best-in-class technologies will allow us to continue outperforming our peers. 
Strong customer relationships, excep- tional service quality and differentiating technologies matter in every environment. 
We are particularly well-positioned in the North American shales where we are the clear leader in efficiency and the preferred partner for maxi- mizing the value of customer assets. Our Frac of the FutureTM delivery platform gets the job done with 
25 percent less capital deployed
and offers maintenance cost savings of up to 50 percent, while improving completion times by up to 50 percent at sites where it is employed. 
The value we have seen from the rollout of our Q10 pumps has truly exceeded our original expectations and created a strong competitive advantage for Halliburton. We continue investing to accelerate the retirement of older, higher-cost fleets as a way to extend our leadership position. Frac of the Future currently represents about 30 percent of our North American fleet, and that number is expected to be closer 
to 50 percent by the end of 2015. 
Big Future 
We look forward to completing our acquisition of Baker Hughes to create a stronger, more diverse company with an unsurpassed depth and breadth of services. We believe this acquisition will accelerate the execution of our key strategies in unconventionals, 
deepwater and mature fields, and create a bellwether global oilfield service company. 
Further, we believe the transaction will result in a broader, more cost- effective service offering, and provide compelling value for our customers. We remain dedicated to developing the technology portfolio and inno- vations of the combined company, and delivering best-in-class solutions and service quality to our customers. 
We are excited about the benefits this transaction will create for stakeholders of both companies who play such a vital role in our success. We believe we will be very well-positioned financially, poised to accelerate growth, deliver outstanding margin improvement 
and drive shareholder returns. 
We greatly appreciate the contri- butions of our employees and Board of Directors, the confidence our cus- tomers show by looking to us as a partner in solutions, and the patience of our investors through the ups and downs of our industry. Rest assured that we will never lose our focus on delivering best-in-class returns and value for all of our stakeholders. 
The long-term fundamentals for our industry remain very strong. Global demand for oil is forecast to increase by approximately 1 million barrels per day in the coming year, and the steep decline curves from aging reservoirs are still at work. Any extended period of under investment resulting from low commodity prices will reduce production, help to restore supply- demand equilibrium, and return the industry to growth. While it is difficult 
to predict the timing of the recovery, we know that it will come. In the meantime, we are taking the neces- sary steps to maintain our financial strength through this period while also looking past the cycle at a big future for Halliburton. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2015,"In 2015, lower oil and gas prices led to substantial reductions in global upstream oil
and gas activity levels resulting in the most challenging year in decades. Halliburton’s commitment to superior execution, our broad service offerings, and our long-standing customer relationships enable us to manage through business cycles and prepare for the market’s eventual recovery. 
The downturn materialized very quickly, beginning in late 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the activity level measured by the Baker Hughes U.S. land rig count declined by 64 percent from the 2014 peak, and we experienced substantial declines in our international markets as well. As our customers’ capital spend declined, so did Halliburton’s activity and the prices paid 
for our products and services. 
But this is a market that Halliburton knows well, and we have experienced these cycles before. We have focused relentlessly on managing our costs. While this required difficult staffing decisions, we are committed to aligning our cost structure with the market, and we believe the actions and decisions taken in 2015 will enable Halliburton to emerge from this downturn prepared to deliver competitive growth and returns. 
Our playbook for a downturn is simple – we control what we can control, preserve our market position and live within our cash flow. We continued to execute our key strategies in the unconventionals, deep water and mature fields markets on a near real-time basis. We also looked beyond the cycle, investing in strategic initiatives and preparing for future recovery. 
Our international operations performed well given the global industry headwinds. Revenues were lower than in 2014, compared with an 18 percent decline in the international drilling and completion spend by our customers. However, aggressive cost control enabled the company to maintain our international margins even with downward pressure on prices. 
Halliburton traditionally has been aligned with operators that have strong balance sheets and fairway acreage in the most important oil and gas basins in North America and across the globe. We are engaged with our customers in their efforts to reduce the cost of producing each barrel of oil equivalent, and have continued to offer them products, services and technologies that are more efficient, reduce non-productive time and improve performance. 
Frac of the FutureTM is a prime example. While industry crew sizes have increased in recent years because of higher hydraulic fracturing intensity, Halliburton’s average crew size has been essentially flat. At year end, Frac of the FutureTM spreads represented 60 percent of our fleet – a more efficient, low-cost delivery platform that offers a clear competitive advantage both in challenging times and during the recovery. 
We drive this improvement by lowering costs at every step. We help operators optimize bit designs and fluid compositions, reduce drilling days, and improve surface efficiency. We also help increase estimated ultimate recoveries by collaborating with our customers to identify the best targets and utilize the right chemistry to produce more barrels. 
Halliburton is the execution company, and 2015 marked another year of improvement in safety and service quality metrics, with significant, double-digit reductions from 2014 in both areas. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we are improving our performance rates. 
In 2015, we continued to work diligently toward the closing of the pending acquisition of Baker Hughes, including the pending regulatory reviews, the divestiture proposals, and planning for integration activities. 
We have tremendous appreciation for the contributions of Halliburton’s employees and
our Board of Directors, the confidence placed in us by our customers to help them find the most efficient, cost-effective and safest means to achieve their goals, and the understanding of our investors who have persevered with us during this challenging business cycle. 
Turning the page to 2016, market visibility remains limited. Activity recovery will depend on commodity prices, which will impact our customers’ ability to invest. We will continue to strategically focus on offering services and solutions that improve our customers’ cost per produced barrel. 
The long-term fundamentals and outlook for the industry remain strong. We expect global demand for oil will continue to grow, and supply levels will contract as output from aging reservoirs decline and lower investment levels result in lower production. These fundamental trends are likely to restore the balance between supply and demand and bring a recovery in oilfield activity. 
We are focused on maintaining a strong customer portfolio, investing in more efficient technology and delivering reliable, best-in-class service quality for our customers, and we are preparing the business for growth when the industry recovery begins. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2016,"In 2016, despite a turbulent year in the oil and gas industry, Halliburton increased market share by collaborating with our customers, adapting to market changes and maintaining our superior service quality. By remaining centered on our customers’ needs, reducing structural costs and focusing on efficient use of our assets, Halliburton successfully navigated the downturn and is well-positioned for the recovery. 
Our playbook during this cycle was built on Halliburton’s strengths: We are the execution company, with the best employees, technology and service offerings to deliver on our value proposition – collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Over the course of the year, we eliminated $1 billion of structural costs and worked to live within our cash flow. This tremendous effort did not come without sacrifice, but it positions Halliburton for the global recovery. 
In North America, the oil and gas industry went through a historic cycle, punctuated by an almost 80 percent decline in the U.S. land rig count. During this downturn Halliburton gained significant market share. As a result, after the market bottomed in North America midway through the year, we were able to utilize this historically high share to drive margin improvement and return to profitability in the fourth quarter. 
As activity increases in North America, we do not expect to rely on rising service pricing alone to earn returns. We recognize that North America’s emergence as the world’s swing producer could mean that cycles may be shorter and commodity prices may be range bound – not as
low as they were during the downturn, but not as high as they were during the last up cycle.
As a result, we plan to make more effective use of our assets through greater asset velocity to increase margins. We will be leaner, avoid over-investing and remain flexible in our cost structure. 
As the recovery began to unfold in North America, we continued to experience headwinds
in our international markets. Low commodity prices stressed our customers’ capital budgets and impacted economics across the international deepwater and mature field markets, resulting in decreased activity and pricing throughout 2016. We expect to see improved activity in
mature fields – where much of the world’s oil is produced – and believe that this market will lead the international recovery in late 2017. While the deepwater market has been the most challenged during the downturn, we continue to work with our customers as we wait for this market to improve. 
Ultimately, stronger and more stable commodity prices will help free our customers from the cage of limited cash flows and enable them to increase investment. This will lead to greater utilization of our services and equipment and generate greater returns. The fundamentals of the macro market have not changed and the last few years of underinvestment means that in the coming upcycle more work will have to be put into fighting decline curves as global demand begins to once again outpace supply. 
As we move forward, our strategy remains the same. We will deliver superior growth, margins and returns by executing on our core strategies in the unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields markets. We will provide our products, services and technologies to customers in the most important oil and gas basins in North America and across the globe. We will collaborate with our customers in their efforts to maximize their asset value and remain focused on integrity, efficiency, safety and service quality. We will grow our service capability by addressing service lines one building block at a time through internal growth, investment and selective acquisitions. 
Halliburton’s 98th year in business was consequential for the company and the industry. Our employees, management and Board of Directors persevered during difficult times. As we enter our 99th year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver reliable execution and industry-leading growth, margins and returns. We appreciate the confidence placed in us by our customers as we work together to find efficient, cost-effective and safe means to achieve their goals, as well as the support of our investors who have remained with us through these challenging times. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2017,"2017 was a tale of two cycles for the oil and gas industry. North America began to recover from one of the steepest industry downturns on record while activity in the international market appeared to reach bottom. Our strong execution culture, clear strategy and customer alignment are enabling us to win the recovery in North America and
to outperform our peers internationally – delivering revenue growth, improved margins and leading returns. 
We are pleased with all that Halliburton accomplished in 2017. We effectively executed our strategy to collaborate and engineer solutions
to maximize asset value for our customers. Thanks to the exceptional performance and commitment of approximately 55,000 Halliburton employees, we outperformed our peers with industry-leading returns and generated strong cash flow. At the same time, we reduced our debt by $1.4 billion, strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. We continued to exercise capital discipline while also advancing our differentiating technologies and digital capabilities. 
In North America, we quickly responded to the recovering market, reactivating equipment and hiring personnel to meet customer demand for efficiency and increased production. Halliburton was the first service company to return to profitability in North America, a direct reflection of our leadership position, scale and technology strength. 
As the international market worked through its own downturn, we gained market share in key regions by focusing on the most active markets while maintaining a presence in other areas that will serve us well going forward. 
We look ahead to 2018 with great optimism and enthusiasm as the macro environment for oil continues to improve. Our North America customers are back to work driving what we expect to be strong growth in unconventional activity. Internationally, we believe the market has reached bottom and we are seeing the beginning of a recovery in mature fields, while deepwater remains challenged. 
Our collaborative approach and differentiating technologies enable
us to deliver the most efficient wells for our customers no matter the geography. These, along with our comprehensive service offerings and stringent cost control efforts, position us well for the continuing recovery in North America and the future recovery of the international market. An added benefit going forward is tax reform. With a lower effective tax rate, Halliburton will be on a more level playing field with our foreign competitors. 
We are more convinced than ever that Halliburton is in the right businesses and is capturing its full potential through a strategy that maximizes asset value for our customers. We are committed to remaining the leading oilfield service company delivering the best value to our customers and the best returns to our investors. And we remain focused on integrity, efficiency, safety and service quality. 
On June 1, 2017, following our vigorous management succession plan, Jeff Miller was unanimously selected by our Board of Directors to succeed Dave Lesar as chief executive officer. Mr. Lesar, having led the Company for nearly 17 years, continues to serve as executive chairman of the Board. We are grateful for his outstanding leadership and look forward to his continued contributions to the success of Halliburton. 
In closing, we want to thank our employees, our Board of Directors and shareholders for the vital role they play in the success of Halliburton. As we continue to serve our customers in this evolving market environment, we know we have the right leadership, employees and strategy in place to guide Halliburton forward into its 100th year in business. Halliburton is the execution company, and we will continue to deliver superior performance for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
"
Haliburton,HAL,Energy,2018,"As we celebrate 100 years of growth, innovation and unparalleled customer service, Halliburton remains committed to generating industry-leading returns for our shareholders, flawlessly executing for our customers and outperforming our peers. We commence our next 
100 years with a clear sense of purpose. Our industry produces affordable and reliable energy that improves the quality of life for people around the world, and reasonable projections show that oil and gas will remain an essential part of the world’s energy portfolio for many years to come. At Halliburton, our purpose is to help our customers satisfy the world’s need for oil and gas – more effectively and efficiently, safely and ethically, 
while minimizing environmental impact and generating leading returns for
our shareholders. This purpose aligns with our core values and underlies 
our strategy, value proposition and financial objectives. 
During 2018, we once again delivered superior growth and returns by capitalizing on the market rebound in North America and the emerging international recovery. We maintained our leading position in a tough, fiercely competitive market, sustained a steady pace of new technology development and improved service quality – all 
with a goal of helping our customers maximize their asset value and delivering leading returns to our shareholders. Thanks to the exceptional performance and commitment of 
over 60,000 Halliburton employees, we outperformed our peers and generated approximately $3.2 billion in operating cash flow. At the same time, we reduced our debt by 
$400 million, strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. We continued to exercise 
capital discipline, while also advancing our differentiating technologies and digital capabilities and expanding our product and service offerings. We also returned $1 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. 
As we enter 2019, our industry is going through a transformation brought on
by the shale revolution and the recent down cycle. North America is now the world’s leading oil producer, the industry is more efficient than ever before and our customers are increasingly focused on generating cash flow.

QUALCOMM,QCOM,Info Tech,2001,"2001 was a positive year for CDMA and for our Company 
Despite a slowdown in the world economy, QUALCOMM and our CDMA licensees this year entered major new markets, grew in existing markets and introduced breakthrough products including CDMA2000 1X, the Wireless Internet LaunchpadTM and the BREW platform. It was a period of slower growth for older and non-CDMA wireless technologies. 
Our business strategy is based on rapid innovation and careful investment to spur the adoption of CDMA wireless technology worldwide through clear competitive advantage. Our intellectual property portfolio is an essential ingredient in all CDMA-based network infrastructure equipment, and wireless handsets and devices. We build stockholder value by generating revenues through the licensing of our CDMA technology and providing expert assistance, by supplying “chipsets” (integrated circuits, system software and support), which incorporate ever more attractive features for early-to-market, cost-effective CDMA products and by enabling wireless software applications through the BREW platform. 
With CDMA now the chosen technology for third- generation wireless voice and Internet access, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) this year achieved record revenues and earnings. We now have over 100 CDMA licensees with more than 50 companies licensed for WCDMA and TD-SCDMA. Under the leadership of Don Schrock, QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) this year raised the competitive bar further in the development and introduction of new families of chips while maintaining growth in chip sales despite the generally down market. QCT has now shipped a cumulative total of
over 525 million chips. 
Commercially Deployed and Miles Ahead QUALCOMM intends to remain the engine for advances in
the wireless industry. With people everywhere relying more and more on mobile communications for business and personal communications including entertainment, mobile commerce, information, safety and education, we are constantly innovating to expand and improve the “user experience.” We continue to work closely with CDMA operators, supporting their priorities in a timely and predictable fashion while driving down costs to ensure them an attractive and profitable business. 
A major milestone on our journey took place this year when third-generation (3G) CDMA wireless technology became a reality. Nationwide 3G networks based on QUALCOMM’s CDMA2000 1X technology officially opened for business in South Korea, with commercial launches by multiple carriers rapidly attracting millions of subscribers. Sprint, Verizon Wireless and other carriers are rolling out nationwide CDMA2000 1X networks in the United States, launching with an exciting array of hand- sets and applications. cdmaOneTM operators worldwide are ra- pidly evolving their networks to 3G CDMA2000 1X. CDMA hand- set production is quickly shifting to CDMA2000 1X, based on pin-compatible QUALCOMM chipsets. This third generation of wireless technology is now opening the door to a vast array of features and services while unleashing the true power of wire less Internet access. 
Wireless service providers everywhere are planning
the evolution or replacement of second-generation systems by third-generation networks, either CDMA2000 1X in existing and new spectrum or WCDMA in new spectrum. We actively support both forms of CDMA but believe that CDMA2000 1X is not only first-to-market, but also the most powerful and cost-effective choice. In support of all CDMA, we have formed a global business development organization that integrates all of our international efforts. Headed by Jeff Jacobs, this organization is focused on driving worldwide market growth for CDMA. 
China Deployments Moving Ahead As part of this globalization effort, we have been particularly focused on two markets with sizable growth potential—China and India. We are assisting wireless service providers in both of these markets as they seek to deploy and optimize networks for the lowest cost. 
In July of this year, China surpassed the United States and became the world’s largest wireless market with over
120 million subscribers. The legacy cellular networks there are based on the older GSM (Global System for Mobile communica- tion) standard. However, China Unicom awarded approximately $1.5 billion in contracts and has now deployed a first phase nationwide cdmaOne network with capacity for 15 million subscribers in over 200 cities. Further, China Unicom has announced a second phase, including upgrades to CDMA2000 1X, to accommodate an additional 20 million subscribers in 2002, followed by a third phase supporting an additional 15 million subscribers by 2003. 
QUALCOMM has granted worldwide subscriber and infrastructure licenses to a number of Chinese manufacturers. Shenzhen Zhongxing Telecom Co. (ZTE) received a $120 million first phase infrastructure contract to build CDMA networks serving 1.1 million subscribers in China’s western provinces. So far, 19 Chinese firms have been approved to produce CDMA 
handsets for the network. We continue to provide extensive technical support for the network deployment and are working closely with Chinese manufacturers. 
The government of India is also dedicated to providing low-cost communications nationwide. This year, wireless local loop operators were authorized to provide limited mobility, allowing mobile services within extensive urban areas, and a number of wireless local loop licenses were awarded. CDMA
is, of course, the technology of choice. Plans are underway for CDMA base stations across most of India to be connected with fiber links, making wireless voice and data communications accessible, even in small villages. The Indian markets repre- sent future growth opportunity for our Company. As with China and other emerging markets around the world, QUALCOMM is well positioned to benefit from the growing migration to CDMA wireless technology. 
Content Delivery Made Affordable In addition to driving early global implementation of CDMA2000 1X networks and developing WCDMA, we are working to commercialize our high data rate technology solution, standardized as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO (Data Optimized). The architecture for this data- optimized technology enables very high-speed Internet access, with burst rates of up to 2.4 Mbps. Wireless communications and the Internet are two of the most important inventions of our time. Joined together and augmented by BREW applica- tions, these technologies have the power to improve our lives in new and meaningful ways. Both CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO support “always on” high data rate secure connections. The door has opened to fast and practical access to e-mail, personal information manager (PIM) functions, web browsing, 
e-commerce, position location and navigation and multimedia, with an ever-increasing menu of applications from developers worldwide to be selected by subscribers and downloaded to the phone using the BREW platform. 
Constantly Driving More Advances As detailed in the “Technology Roadmap” beginning on page 8 of this report, QUALCOMM’s CDMA chipsets embody the most advanced
3G CDMA technologies, including CDMA2000 1X, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and WCDMA modes. Under the leadership of Steve Altman, the QUALCOMM Technology Licensing business demonstrated our ability to earn royalties on all modes of CDMA by successfully negotiating over 50 licensing agreements with manufacturers of WCDMA and TD-SCDMA products. A key milestone this year was the signing of a new multi-million dollar agreement with Nokia, expanding the terms of our existing subscriber cross-licensing agreement and adding a new infrastructure equipment license. Nokia is the world’s leading handset supplier and we look forward to working with them in the effort to bring new, global 3G wireless solutions to market. 
Given the large installed base of GSM and to help the migration of GSM networks to 3G CDMA, we are committed to delivering multi-mode, multi-band chipsets supporting one or more flavors of CDMA together with GSM/GPRS. These multi-mode, multi-band chips will enable “world phones” and other wireless devices to provide truly global roaming and ubiquitous interoperability without user intervention. 
A breakthrough initiative in QCT this year was
the development of radioOneTM architecture. This innovation eliminates the need for intermediate frequency conversion, saving cost, size and power by allowing manufactures to design multi-band wireless devices with fewer parts, smaller form factors and improved talk and standby times. We plan to introduce radioOne architecture in our 3G MSM6000 family
of chipsets in 2002. 
Another revolutionary technology debut this fiscal year was our gpsOne position location solution. In response to the FCC mandate, QUALCOMM and SnapTrack have been working for several years on an Enhanced 911 (E911) solution that integrates position location capability into the chips that drive wireless handsets and devices. Called gpsOne, this tech- nology enables wireless service operators to provide police and other public safety officials the ability to locate wireless callers in emergency situations. gpsOne provides significant cost, time-to-market, and performance advantages, and has been adopted by CDMA carriers around the world. 
Motivated by the tragic events of September 11, the FCC has been asked to tighten requirements to include the ability to locate wireless callers inside large structures, including subway stations, office buildings or schools. Our technology already works wherever cellular calls can be received and/or GPS satellites viewed and generally exceeds the FCC accuracy requirement by directing emergency service workers within 10 to 30 meters of the caller. 
In 2001, gpsOne was deployed in Japan with great success and in October Sprint PCS began selling phones containing chips with this technology in the United States. Other wireless service providers are rapidly coming online. The solution is technology-agnostic and works on all types of wireless networks. To demonstrate, we conducted successful tests over GSM networks in Paris, Bonn, London and other locations this year, which included cross-border roaming. 
In April, a security company initiated gpsOne- enabled service over KDDI’s cellular system in Japan and quickly received 70,000 orders. In the first few days, the service was able to locate a little girl lost in a large park in Osaka. This promising technology has also been deployed over NTT DoCoMo’s PDC cellular network in Japan. 
Cool Data and Multimedia Applications
QUALCOMM is driving the convergence of wireless access
and data applications on several levels. At the chipset level, QUALCOMM’s Wireless Internet Launchpad suite offers many integrated capabilities for position location, multimedia, stor- age, connectivity and user interface functions. To leverage these features, our QUALCOMM Internet Services business, headed by Peggy Johnson, developed the BREW platform. QIS, which was launched this year, became part of the new QUALCOMM Wireless and Internet Group under the direction of Paul Jacobs. 
The BREW initiative provides developers with a stan- dardized platform that allows rapid development of applications that are downloadable into BREW-enabled handsets and devices. The applications they create are distributed with QUALCOMM’s assistance to the wireless service providers who can benefit by expansion and differentiation of their services. Consumers benefit by having instant access to easily downloadable applica- tions such as games, music players, “nanny cams,” real-time traffic reports, maps, chat and messaging, m-commerce and personal and Internet information. On the business-to-business side of the market, QUALCOMM subsidiary Wireless Knowledge is using the BREW platform to develop enterprise solutions such as corporate e-mail and contact management and field asset tracking. Initially a joint venture with Microsoft, Wireless Knowledge acquired Microsoft’s interest and became a QUALCOMM subsidiary in November under the leadership
of Eric Schultz. 
Carriers, Developers and Manufacturers Agree
By aligning our business units and development efforts toward a common goal, QUALCOMM achieves many important synergies. Our CDMA technology expertise improves our chipset designs. Our chipsets are powering new BREW-based wireless data 
applications. Ultimately, the growing popularity of wireless data services will fuel added demand for CDMA, and for higher-end devices that take advantage of its ever-increasing capabilities. This growth cycle is key to QUALCOMM’s continued success. 
Future growth for our Company is also fueled by investments in research, development and strategic entrepre- neurial activities. As the recognized expert in CDMA, we play
a vital role in creating new industry standards that help move the technology forward. We incorporate these standards into a range of CDMA chipsets and software. To foster the develop- ment of compelling new products and services, we invest our financial and intellectual capital into promising early stage companies and joint ventures. We also make strategic invest- ments in carriers in places like North America, Brazil, South Korea, Australia and elsewhere around the world. As part of that continuing effort to expedite deployment of CDMA, last year we formed QUALCOMM Ventures with a plan to invest up to $500 million over a four-year period. 
Through a joint venture with Technicolor, QUALCOMM is applying its technology expertise to digital motion picture delivery and playback. This year we began marketing ABSoluteTM image compression technology, a highly efficient solution developed specifically for Digital Cinema. This technology greatly reduces the amount of digital information needed to represent high-quality digital images. From the studio master to the theater’s digital projection system, the QUALCOMM Digital Media (QDM) division has developed a comprehensive solution with the potential to transform the motion picture industry. 
Under the leadership of Kim Koro, QDM together
with Technicolor Digital Cinema presented a comprehensive business and technical strategy to the industry this year, and demonstrated QUALCOMM’s compression technology at a major 
industry conference. In December, QDM’s technology gained national visibility with the first commercial rollout by Technicolor Digital Cinema of our digital cinema system featuring a digital release of the Warner Bros. Pictures’ Ocean’s Eleven movie. 
In another key business area, QDM is under contract to build initial quantities of highly secure handsets for the U.S. government. These handsets operate nationwide on CDMA cellular infrastructure, and can contribute to the homeland security initiatives. Under the leadership of Scott Becker, this Fall the QUALCOMM Wireless Systems division demonstrated a set of aviation safety solutions taking advantage of the GlobalstarTM Satellite Communications System. Using that pipeline and our onboard technology system (called MDSS), we demonstrated in flight a number of safety and security applications including live video streaming from cabin and cockpit to ground. Globalstar offers the highest data rate of any mobile satellite telephone system, and is the only satellite- based system to use QUALCOMM’s CDMA technology. 
Communicating with Drivers and Mobile Assets QUALCOMM’s Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS) supplies fleet tracking and communications services primarily to the long-haul trucking industry. High fuel prices and economic conditions have pressured the transportation industry this year. However, the division has shipped a cumulative
total of over 400,000 OmniTRACS satellite-based systems, and continued to gain acceptance of our CDMA-based terrestrial OmniExpress system. We also acquired the assets of the Eaton Corporation Trucking Information Services, which allows us to provide enhanced logistics management applications on our MVPcTM in-vehicle computer. 
As part of our vertical market strategy, we signed
a purchase agreement with Roadway Express, the largest less-than-truckload carrier in the United States, to supply our OmniExpress system. Under the leadership of Chris Wolfe, QWBS announced the formation of a wireless heavy equipment consortium and signed industry leaders to broaden the scope of the division. 
Finally this year, QWBS introduced a new BREW application called OmniOneTM, a low-cost transportation applica- tion for digital handsets that will provide trucking companies, 
affiliate fleets and subcontractors a powerful, portable commu- nications tool that enables drivers and dispatchers to receive and send load assignments, status updates and other information. 
Given the challenging business environment and global economy, we did not achieve our financial goals in 2001. However, our Company posted very solid results this year and set the stage for substantial future growth. We remain confi- dent in our overall business strategy. I’m pleased to report that despite global economic pressures, we expect to grow revenues and profits in 2002 as 2G and 3G CDMA systems are deployed around the world. 
After the implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 this fiscal year, pro forma revenues were $2.7 billion, flat from
the year ago period. However, two of our core businesses, Technology Licensing and CDMA Technologies, grew their respective pro forma revenues in fiscal 2001. Pro forma earnings per share were $0.98 in fiscal 2001, compared to $1.01 in the year ago period. QUALCOMM’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaled approximately $2.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, and we have essentially no debt. 
QUALCOMM is fully committed to an aggressive
R&D program aimed at stimulating our market and growing our business. We are continually adapting our Company to meet changes in the environment. As part of that strategy this year we created two major groups headed by Paul Jacobs and Don Schrock. We also added chief operating officer responsibil- ities to Tony Thornley, who continues to serve as the Company’s chief financial officer. I’m quite proud of our entire executive team and all the employees at QUALCOMM who are working hard to create value for stockholders by growing our business and building on our successes. 
Thank you for continuing to support QUALCOMM and its vision.

QUALCOMM,QCOM,Info Tech,2002,"TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS, 
We are pleased with the substantial progress achieved this year in each of our businesses. QUALCOMM has outperformed most communications technology companies, largely because of the strong acceptance of CDMA2000 by CDMA operators and their customers. We continue to lead the industry in the devel- opment and delivery of digital wireless solutions based on CDMA, including CDMA2000 and WCDMA, both based on the innovative technology we pioneered over a decade ago. Based on results to date for operators in South Korea, Japan, and North America, third-generation (3G) features are proving very pop- ular with customers and enterprises, resulting in an increase in average revenue per user (ARPU). 
CDMA was first envisioned as a new way to make wireless voice calls more efficient and reliable. It has rapidly evolved into a new way for people to learn, play, navigate and work. Users are finding that their always-on wireless con- nection to the Internet—supporting a growing number of applications and content —makes life safer and easier, more productive and just plain fun. QUALCOMM was first-to-market with the best high-speed wireless data solutions for enabling these new services. 
THE THIRD GENERATION IS HERE 
3G CDMA technology is now in commercial operation with 32 operators in 16 countries. New systems are being installed in countries such as India and Indonesia, and existing systems are being upgraded from second-generation cdmaOne to third-generation CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO. 
QUALCOMM HAS A HIGHLY FOCUSED BUSINESS STRATEGY THAT HAS ENABLED OUR COMPANY TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE THIS YEAR EVEN THOUGH THE TELECOM SECTOR CONTINUED TO FEEL THE IMPACT OF A STRUGGLING ECONOMY. 
A key reason for this rapid acceptance is the economic benefit that CDMA2000 provides to wireless carriers. They can upgrade their existing networks, increasing voice and data capacity, coverage and quality with moderate expen- ditures for infrastructure equipment. With chips and software supplied by QUALCOMM, the upgrade for phones and infrastructure is relatively easy and low-cost and is backwards-compatible, allowing subscribers to use both old and new phones and to roam seamlessly among CDMA networks. With our newest generation of chips and software, roaming will be extended to most second- and third-generation networks, including GSM. 
NEW NETWORKS 
QUALCOMM has a highly focused business strategy that has enabled our Company to strengthen its position in the marketplace this year even though the telecom sector continued to feel the impact of a struggling economy. Second-generation network rollouts were scaled back and subscriber growth slowed down as many operators found it difficult to raise the capital they needed to invest in new equipment for their networks. This was in stark contrast to what is happening with QUALCOMM and CDMA technology. 
The primary CDMA markets in South Korea, Japan and the Americas have per- formed very well and we saw evidence of that this year with the launch of new networks and the introduction of many new phone models and other devices based on 3G CDMA technology. We also made substantial progress this year in cementing relationships that will ensure continued growth for our Company in many key new markets including China, India, Latin America, throughout Asia, and hopefully, soon in Europe. 
As part of our ongoing effort to promote and support the spread of CDMA tech- nology, QUALCOMM’s global development team works closely with operators and equipment manufacturers throughout the world to make sure that the transition to third-generation services is fully supported and economically successful. 
NEW OPPORTUNITIES 
One way that we provide support is through working closely with operators and manufacturers on our technology roadmap including our rapidly evolving CDMA chipsets and our BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) platform. QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies achieved record sales this year as a result 
of steadily increasing demand for our industry-leading chipsets (integrated circuits and system software) which provide our customers with advanced capabilities and compelling economics. 
Our Company is privileged to employ many of the best CDMA engineers in the world today, enabling us to amass a rapidly growing patent portfolio. The QUALCOMM Technology Licensing arm of our business collects royalties and licensing fees from manufacturers who utilize our CDMA patent portfolio for the design and production of infrastructure equipment for networks, phones and other devices such as wireless modem cards and PDAs. This year we achieved a significant milestone in the licensing business when agreements were signed with both Alcatel and Siemens, signifying that QUALCOMM has now become a technology partner and often a key supplier to virtually every major manufacturer in the wireless industry. 
The CDMA technology we pioneered now accounts for approximately 20 percent of the worldwide wireless communications market, and the percentage is growing. CDMA technology has been adopted by almost all companies for third-generation networks for good reason: It provides higher quality and more efficient use of expensive spectrum for both voice and data, is cost-effective, and enables a broad range of devices and services. 
Now that the high-speed wireless “pipeline” has been enabled, QUALCOMM
is working with operators, device manufacturers and software developers worldwide to ensure an increasing flow of applications tailored to consumers’ individual needs for information, entertainment, commerce, business and security. 
Our BREW initiative provides support for software developers, device manufac- turers and wireless operators, arming them with technology tools and an end-to-end business model to bring new applications to worldwide markets, independent of network technology. This year BREW really took off, with opera- tors in South Korea, Japan and the Americas launching wireless data services, all with strong customer acceptance. We are evolving BREW to even further support manufacturers to more rapidly test and bring to market phones and devices that utilize the broad range of advanced capabilities enabled by our chips and system software. With instant messaging, music downloading, games, mobile commerce, mapping and navigation, personal information management (PIM) functions, browsers, security and a range of vertical business applications, BREW-based services have proven to increase operator revenues and customer retention rates. 
One of the more exciting examples of this was the commercial launch of navigation services via BREW-enabled phones using QUALCOMM’s gpsOne technology. Network software developed by our SnapTrack subsidiary communicates with the QUALCOMM chipsets in wireless phones to enable location-based services like personal navigation. Today there are more than five million gpsOne-enabled devices in commercial use in Asia and North America. 
Several wireless operators in the U.S. are selling gpsOne-enabled phones to meet the E-911 wireless safety obligation mandated by the federal government. Using QUALCOMM’s powerful technology, Sprint PCS and Verizon Wireless are already achieving the enhanced safety of E-911 services in many regions of the United States. QUALCOMM’s gpsOne technology has quickly become the world’s most widely deployed position location system for mobile phones. 
NEW APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES 
Other noteworthy technology breakthroughs at QUALCOMM this year included the on-time shipment of our multimedia chipset with features that support digital camera phones and streaming video and music downloads. We began sampling our MSM6xxx family of chips based on radioOne technology, which eliminates the intermediate frequency components, simplifying and reducing the cost, space, and power for phones and devices, especially those that sup- port multiple frequency bands, position location and BluetoothTM. radioOne also 
enables our next evolution of capacity enhancements using antenna diversity to achieve yet another doubling of CDMA voice capacity. 
NEW PRODUCTS AND MARKETS 
Our Company was an early innovator of wireless data applications and we have a long track record of working with industry and government on mission-critical wireless applications involving safety and security. Building on that foundation, this year our Digital Media division produced the world’s only CDMA handset that meets government security standards for ensuring the protection of top- secret communications. QUALCOMM was recently awarded a contract to support the provisioning of this secure handset in South Korea. 
As part of the Homeland Security initiative, QUALCOMM is also participating with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in an operational test to determine the effectiveness of high-tech systems in enhancing security for transportation of hazardous materials by truck. The 18-month operational test is part of a DOT program to ensure our nation’s safety against further terrorist attacks. The U.S. DOT awarded the project to Battelle Memorial Institute. QUALCOMM is a core member of the team as the technical integrator for the project, which will test capabilities such as biometric driver verification, off- route vehicle alerts, stolen vehicle alerts, cargo tampering alerts and remote vehicle disabling. 
QUALCOMM technology is helping address the need for secure wireless voice and data communications on many fronts. Our industry-leading truck tracking business now features a growing number of services and products focused on meeting the needs of customers in new transportation markets including the less-than-truckload and private fleet markets and the gigantic heavy equip- ment market. And the anti-hijacking technologies introduced and tested in Brazil are now being looked at by the U.S. Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS). 
OUR STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE 
To help speed the worldwide transition to wireless services based on 3G CDMA, we are making strategic investments and working closely with operators and manufacturers around the world. For example, we invested in a U.K.-based company called Inquam, which is using the 450 MHz frequency band to migrate networks to CDMA, supporting dispatch and other business applications. 
IN MANY RESPECTS, QUALCOMM IS ENERGIZING THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY BY PROVIDING THE ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR PROLIFERATING
NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TODAY’S HIGH- SPEED NETWORK DATA CAPABILITIES. 
Development of multimode devices that will communicate between all types of networks and allow for effective roaming between existing second-generation and third-generation networks around the world has been a major focus for us. We introduced chipsets and system software this year that will support development of 3G phones with multimode capabilities for either CDMA2000 or WCDMA/UMTS networks. 
We also introduced an alternative for GSM operators to migrate to third- generation CDMA by overlaying their existing GSM networks with CDMA2000 radio equipment while preserving their investment in systems and equipment. We named this GSM1x. We continue to explore new areas of opportunity for the future development of wireless systems and are dedicating engineers in our own organization to this task as well as investing in smaller companies who have innovative ideas that will be complementary to our capabilities in
the future. 
QUALCOMM posted GAAP revenues of $3.0 billion in fiscal 2002, a 13 percent increase over the $2.7 billion posted in fiscal 2001. GAAP reported earnings were $360 million and EPS was $0.44 in fiscal 2002 compared with a loss of $578 million (or $0.76 per share) in fiscal 2001. 
Pro forma revenues from our core operations were $2.9 billion in 2002, which was an increase of 9 percent over the year ago period. Pro forma earnings this year were $794 million or $0.98 per share, an increase of 11 percent compared to $710 million or $0.88 per share in fiscal 2001. (Pro forma results exclude 
charges related to the values of marketable equity securities and derivatives, amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets, con- solidated losses of the Vesper Companies in Brazil and other gains and losses related to strategic investments.) The increase in revenues in fiscal 2002 was primarily related to increasing demand for CDMA products across all major regions of CDMA deployment. The rate of growth in revenues and earnings accelerated in our fiscal fourth quarter and the outlook for 2003 is for good growth in both revenues and earnings. 
Beginning in fiscal 2003, QUALCOMM will no longer amortize goodwill, in accordance with new accounting standards. We intend to continue to report by existing segments—QCT, QTL, QWI and QSI. When summed, QCT, QTL, QWI, plus small amounts of other revenues and earnings, represent core operations. QSI represents strategic initiatives in the form of investments to support the growth of the core operations. 
With increasing free cash flow and a strong balance sheet, we believe that QUALCOMM is well-positioned for continuing revenue and profit growth in the future. We continue to execute on our strategy for increasing global acceptance of our technology. That means continuing our investment in R&D, particularly in places where it’s important for the growth of the market. It also means growing our sales and support staff. 
COMMITTED TO BUSINESS TRANSPARENCY 
In reporting our results to stockholders, it seems appropriate to pause for a moment and reflect on the subject of corporate governance. This topic was top-of-mind for many people this year. As a Company that takes its responsibil- ity to stockholders very seriously, we applaud any efforts aimed at increasing corporate transparency and assuring investor confidence. QUALCOMM fully supports the SEC request for the certification of financial reports and was one of the first major corporations to comply with this initiative. 
Since our founding over 17 years ago, we have been committed to managing our Company according to the highest ethical standards. We strive to provide investors with timely, accurate and helpful information within established accounting, legal and ethical guidelines. We continue to review our corporate 
governance to ensure that our Board of Directors is diverse and independent with the strength and commitment to oversee and guide our executive team to maximize shareholder value while maintaining accountability. 
QUALCOMM remains the technology leader in an expanding market. Our near-term and long-term strategies focused on innovation, internal growth with only occasional acquisitions, and customer focus continue to support our growth and profitability without major changes. In many respects, QUALCOMM is energizing the consumer electronics industry by providing the enabling technologies for proliferating new products and services that will take advantage of today’s high-speed network data capabilities. As more network deployments take place, the introduction of more devices will follow. Quite simply, this means more opportunity for QUALCOMM. We have a vision for the future and the financial strength to fund our growth. QUALCOMM enjoyed a successful year in 2002, but the best is yet to come. On behalf of all of us here at QUALCOMM, we thank you for your continued support.

QUALCOMM,QCOM,Info Tech,2003,"QUALCOMM enjoyed record revenues and earnings in fiscal 2003 as the CDMA wireless communications sector experienced excellent growth. 3G CDMA is now a proven commercial success, with over 70 million subscribers attracted by high quality voice and data and the continually growing variety of rich data applica- tions. As of September 2003, the number of subscribers of CDMA technology, including 2G and 3G, reached approximately 174 million (source: CDMA Development Group). 
We generated significant positive cash flow this year, allowing us to invest $158 million in net stock repurchases and to pay $135 million in cash dividends to stockholders. Despite a slow worldwide economy, we continued to invest in R&D to increase our leadership in all areas of wireless and to support operators worldwide in their adoption of 3G CDMA technology, whether CDMA2000
or WCDMA. 
WORKING AT ALL LEVELS OF THE WIRELESS VALUE CHAIN 
A high-speed barrier was crossed when “data optimized” networks, based
on CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, rolled out commercially in Asia in 2002 and in the Americas this year. CDMA2000 1xEV-DO delivers a peak data rate of 2.4 Megabits per second, enabling lower transmission costs and new consumer and enterprise services. Many CDMA wireless devices came to market, ranging from inexpensive starter handsets to wireless computing devices and three- dimensional color displays, feature-rich smartphones supporting position location, video and camera capabilities. 
Our BREW system has now proven its power as the only open end-to-end applications development and distribution system in wide commercial use. Hundreds of BREW application developers located around the world are taking advantage of the broad support offered to them by QUALCOMM, including software development kits and marketing support available via the Internet. 
The rich variety of their applications allowed 13 major regional operators to differentiate service offerings and increase average revenue per user (ARPU). Wireless subscribers in North America, Japan, South Korea, China, Brazil and elsewhere demonstrated their willingness to pay for these services, registering more than 70 million downloads of a multitude of data applications worldwide. 
Generating profits is key to growing our company, and we are pleased to report that QUALCOMM results were very strong this year. 
We are one of the few companies in the world now supplying multi- mode, multiband technology that integrates wireless interoperability into one full-featured chip. 
THE FIRST COMMERCIAL 3G CDMA CHIPSET SOLUTION 
QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) provides manufacturers with highly integrated and broadly segmented chips and software they need to design and produce first-to-market, compelling products that people want to buy. Central
to our business model is our commitment to develop new technology that is backwards compatible, facilitating performance upgrades while extending the return on investment for existing equipment. Older generation phones continue to work on upgraded networks and new phones work on existing networks. This year we provided samples of multimode chips to our customers that extend this capability to allow phones to work on 3G CDMA2000 or WCDMA networks while maintaining backwards compatibility to 2G GSM and 2.5G GPRS networks. 
Through the combined efforts of QCT, QUALCOMM Internet Services (QIS)
and SnapTrack, QUALCOMM is adding low cost GPS receiving capability to 3G CDMA phones and certain 2G phones, with full support for wireless E-911 and for enhanced location-based services. Developers worldwide are adding to the variety of BREW applications that exploit gpsOne capability to provide visual and spoken directions, locate services in the vicinity and find nearby friends. Since key functions of gpsOne are performed in the handset, location privacy is under the control of the user. 
QUALCOMM’s technology leadership and success in the 3G market is derived
in part from the strength of our ever-growing patent portfolio. More than 125 manufacturers have license agreements with QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) covering cdmaOne and CDMA2000 applications, and more than 50 manufacturers have licenses covering WCDMA and TD-SCDMA standards. 
MAKING WIRELESS DATA USEFUL 
The QUALCOMM Wireless Internet Group (QWI) includes QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), which offers our OmniTRACS family of products, providing wireless tracking and other services. We continue to grow this busi- ness, partly by extending our core competencies into other markets such as reliable data communications for outpatient cardiac patients, heavy industrial equipment tracking and support for the Homeland Security Initiative in the United States. 
Another key part of QWI is QIS, whose mission is to make the wireless Internet ever more useful for consumers and enterprise. In addition to its market-leading BREW offering, QIS released a significant upgrade to its world-class Eudora® e-mail software this year. It also made good progress in commercializing QChatTM, the QUALCOMM push-to-chat system that takes advantage of the BREW application development platform. 
Also part of the QWI Group, QUALCOMM Digital Media (QDM) provides CDMA and other QUALCOMM technologies to the United States government and has played a leadership role in the emerging digital cinema industry. This year, with delays in the launch of digital cinema, we shifted our strategy, selling our business interest in Technicolor Digital Cinema to Thomson, a French technology company. QDM continues to focus on developing innovative and specialized capabilities for National Defense and Homeland Security, such as the QSec-2700 cellular phone. These innovative capabilities have often been applied to the commercial sector for new business opportunities. 
DRIVING DATA REVENUES 
BREW is a powerful engine for helping wireless operators increase data revenue by extending and differentiating the services they offer to customers. We saw strong evidence that the strategy is working when Verizon Wireless announced in April 2003 that their BREW-based data service called “Get It Now” earned 
an incremental increase in average revenue per user of $7.50. 
More than 1,400 developers and other interested parties attended the sold-out Third Annual BREW Developers Conference hosted by QUALCOMM in San Diego in April 2003. One highlight was a demonstration of multimedia messaging service (MMS) interoperability between CDMA and GSM networks, an industry first, accomplished with a downloadable BREW application. 
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS 
A key tenet of the QUALCOMM business model is our commitment to listen carefully to our customers, manufacturers, operators and subscribers to ensure that we bring useful and proven solutions early to market. To that end, we provide a comprehensive and segmented semiconductor technology roadmap to our customers, together with a segmented application platform to drive broader adoption of data. 
QUALCOMM is well positioned to benefit from increasing global demand for wireless communications. We are leading the industry by supplying multimode, multiband technology that integrates wireless interoperability into one full- featured chip. Among the significant milestones this year, our QCT business shipped samples of the MSM6300TM chip, enabling the first true multimode, 
multiband phone incorporating GSM and CDMA technologies. We believe that high and mid-tier phones will increasingly use multimode, multiband capability to allow users to roam globally. 
INROADS INTO NEW MARKETS 
A number of operators have launched, or are preparing to launch, commercial services based on WCDMA, which provides one transition path to high-speed data capability for the very large base of GSM operators. By being early to market with full-featured WCDMA chips and software that follow the industry standard and by leveraging our experience with CDMA networks, QUALCOMM has taken a leadership role in facilitating interoperability testing with key WCDMA and GSM/GPRS operators and infrastructure vendors. 
A second transition path for GSM operators is provided by our GSM1x solution, which interfaces commercially proven CDMA2000 radio equipment and phones to GSM core network equipment. GSM1x, which requires only 1.25 MHz of spectrum for the transmission of highly efficient voice and data, can be intro- duced in existing 1G and 2G spectrum (where allowed by regulators), as well as in 3G spectrum. This greatly reduces the cost of upgrading to 3G services. Successful GSM1x field trials were conducted this year with China Unicom. 
A GROWING WORLDWIDE FOOTPRINT 
In the world’s largest wireless market, China Unicom is approaching 20 million CDMA subscribers and is in the third phase of network expansion. The govern- ment is evaluating and considering 2.1 GHz 3G license awards. China Telecom and China Netcom are anxious to supplement their wireline offerings with 
3G CDMA wireless services. 
In just a few months, India has added over five million CDMA subscribers with limited mobility and is poised for explosive growth given the intense consumer demand in its largely untapped market and the recent approval of unified licenses which authorize full mobility using CDMA technology. 
The launch by Verizon Wireless of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO service in San Diego and Washington, D.C. heralds growth of a whole new range of services, already proven in South Korea, and recently launched in Japan. 
WCDMA service is now available in Australia, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the United Kingdom. A number of operators are preparing to launch in 2004. In several countries, including Romania and Russia, operators have launched CDMA service at frequencies previously designated for 1G analog service. 
Through QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI), our company makes strategic investments to further the worldwide growth of CDMA. This year we scaled back on these investments and in fact realized significant net cash inflows from previous investments. QUALCOMM remains committed to providing small amounts of financial assistance, where appropriate, to stimulate market growth while earning reasonable returns. 
In December 2003, we finalized our sale of Ve_sper to Embratel Participações S.A. in the Brazilian market. This transaction was a positive strategic move for all parties involved, as Embratel’s financial strength, Brazilian telecom expertise, and ability to realize significant synergies from its existing operations will
help Vésper enhance its voice and data service offerings. In particular, we are encouraged by Embratel’s plans to extend and expand Vésper’s position in Brazil’s high-speed broadband Internet access market as it grows Latin America’s first, and largest, 3G CDMA 1xEV-DO network. 
WE ARE FOCUSED ON STOCKHOLDER VALUE 
Generating profits is key to growing our company, and in fiscal 2003, QUALCOMM achieved record results. Total GAAP revenue in fiscal 2003 grew to $4.0 billion, up 31%, compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2002. GAAP net income was $827 million this fiscal year, a 130% increase over the previous year. GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2003 were $1.01, a 130% increase 
over 2002. Earnings per share excludi finng QSI were $1.42 (see note regarding use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations on page 29). And
we generated excellent cash flows in fiscal 2003, increasing our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances from $3.2 billion to $5.4 billion. 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, as a result of our strong cash position,
we announced our first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share. In July, with recent changes in United States tax law making the distribution of dividends more efficient, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share, a 40% increase. We also embarked on a $1 billion share repurchase program in March 2003 to be executed over the next two years whenever purchase conditions are believed to be accretive. In fiscal 2003, we made net stock repurchases of $158 million. QUALCOMM is intently focused on stockholder value. We believe that returning capital to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases is a prudent way to increase stockholder value. 
Key to promoting stockholder value is our successful effort to employ and retain the finest people in our industry. Our stock option plans have been very effective to date, contributing to an extremely high employee retention rate. We believe stock options, properly handled and controlled, allow us to attract and retain talented employees and directors, and help align stockholder and employee interests. Since the founding of QUALCOMM, we have been strong advocates of business transparency and integrity and have strived to embrace best practices in all areas of our business and corporate governance. 
In closing, we extend best wishes and gratitude to Don Schrock, who retired this year as president of QCT after many years of exceptional service. And we would like to thank all of the people of QUALCOMM who contribute their talent and passion in executing a broadly shared vision for growing a great company.

QUALCOMM,QCOM,Info Tech,2004,"QUALCOMM innovations speed the transition to 3G with exciting devices and wireless multimedia 
To Our Stockholders 
QUALCOMM generated record revenues, earnings
and operating cash flows this year, due to the growing acceptance of CDMA-based 3G digital wireless tech- nology and advanced devices. We are pleased to note that our Company ranked number 55 on The Wall Street Journal list of “World’s Largest Public Companies” (based on market capitalization as of August 31, 2004).1 
3G CDMA IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND GROWING 
Our initial 3G offering— CDMA2000® 1X—enabled
the world’s first commercial high-speed wireless voice and data networks. In the four years since its launch
in South Korea, CDMA2000 has expanded throughout Asia, Australia, the Americas and Europe and second- generation (2G) CDMA users have rapidly transitioned to 3G. The next CDMA2000 evolution, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, is growing rapidly, driven by users’ desire for higher data rate applications and lower costs for a range of multimedia and data services. CDMA continues to
be the fastest-growing wireless standard of all leading cellular technologies.2 
The second widely used 3G technology, Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), is now driving an accelerating 
transition from 2G to 3G services in Japan following
its 2001 launch by NTT DoCoMo. WCDMA growth is now underway in Europe, where Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa was first to market in 2003 with its 3 UK service in Europe. Vodafone, Telefonica, T-Mobile, Orange, O2 and many others have launched WCDMA networks. There are now 39 operating compa- nies in Europe providing services on WCDMA networks. 
This exciting growth has benefited everyone in the CDMA wireless value chain, from equipment manufacturers, network operators and application publishers and devel- opers, to the consumers and business users who rely on today’s increasingly sophisticated wireless devices for “always with you” communications, information and entertainment services. 
QUALCOMM owns many patents that are essential
to 3G devices and network infrastructure. QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) earns royalties from our licensees. QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) has become the world’s leading designer and supplier of the integrated circuits and system software (chipsets) found in 3G devices and networks worldwide. 
Our revenues, earnings and operating cash flow growth this year exceeded the high end of our estimates, due in part to the popularity of devices that take advantage of 3G features and capabilities, such as high-quality color screens, camera phones, position location and multimedia services. We estimate that approximately 170 million CDMA-enabled devices were sold by manu- facturers worldwide in calendar 2004, a 45% increase over the previous year. In calendar 2004, we saw unprecedented demand for our chipsets, which led to shortages in certain components. To put this demand into perspective, in fiscal year 2002, we shipped approximately 65 million MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chips. Comparatively, in fiscal year 2004, we more than doubled MSM shipments to approximately 137 million chips. To accommodate the upsurge in demand and ensure future product supply, we have made several key improvements in our supply chain and operational processes. Additionally, we have invested in long-term capacity agreements which have enabled our supply chain partners to significantly increase and secure production capacity on our behalf. In addition to our core software and hardware engineering base in San Diego, we added engineering teams in North Carolina, Texas, Germany, India and the United Kingdom. These new groups will help us to continue to provide complete system solutions to an expanding customer base and worldwide marketplace. 
MOBILE DATA USAGE IS ACCELERATING 
Our chipsets support access to QUALCOMM’s Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless® (BREW®) solution, which enables the development, delivery and monetiza- tion of advanced applications and content, allowing operators and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to differentiate their products and services and increase revenues. The combination of high-speed networks 
and BREW-enabled devices is helping spur increasing demand for mobile data services. More than 200 million downloads of BREW-based applications have now been logged and BREW application publishers and developers are benefiting from increasing revenues. 
A notable success story this year was the initial public offering of JAMDAT® Mobile, Inc. A global publisher of wireless entertainment applications, JAMDAT credited its growth in part to the strength of the BREW solution. The wireless games market served by JAMDAT and others is a growth industry. Analysts predict that global wireless game revenues will grow to $8.4 billion and total wireless data revenues are expected to increase to over $140 billion by 2008, representing a compound annual growth rate of 49 percent. We expect 3G mobile handsets and BREW to become a major platform in this segment.3 
WIRELESS BROADBAND IS OFF AND RUNNING 
Taking advantage of the rich features of QUALCOMM’s most advanced commercial high-speed data technology, South Korea was first to market in 2002 with wide-area wireless broadband networks based on the CDMA2000 1xEV-DO solution. The country’s two largest operators— SK Telecom (SKT) and KT Freetel (KTF)—have seen vigorous demand for multimedia services and have quickly achieved a combined total of more than 
10 million subscribers to their high-speed networks. 
In Japan, reports indicate KDDI improved its competi- tive position since deploying the new service, CDMA 1x WIN, experiencing a four-fold increase in net additions to its subscriber base relative to other Japanese opera- tors. Building on the success of its 30-second music clip service, in November 2004, KDDI began offering subscribers the ability to down load full songs from its catalog of 10,000 tunes. 
In the United States, Verizon Wireless began its nation- wide rollout of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO this year, extending coverage to include 14 metropolitan markets and 24 airports. Marketed under the name BroadbandAccess, the service provides CDMA-enabled laptop users high-speed wireless connectivity for a fixed fee of approximately $80 per month. Initially focused primarily on business users, Verizon was first to market in the United States with a high-speed commercial wide-area wireless Internet service. 
Also in the United States, Sprint PCS announced deployment plans for CDMA2000 1xEV-DO service
on its nationwide wireless network and other regional operators in North America are expected to follow. Elsewhere in the world, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO networks have been commercially deployed in Australia, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Guatemala and Israel, and a growing list of operators are planning upgrades or new network deployments. This includes China Unicom, which now serves more than 28 million CDMA subscribers in the world’s largest wireless market. 
CONTINUING PROGRESS IN WORLDWIDE MARKETS 
Significant developments on regulatory issues and market trends occurred this fiscal year that should prove beneficial to QUALCOMM. In the United States, imple- mentation of local number portability allows wired and wireless subscribers to transition easily to networks that offer attractive multimedia services. The two largest United States CDMA networks, operated by Verizon and Sprint, posted strong results this year, demonstrating that CDMA is a popular choice for consumers and businesses. 
Regulatory authorities in India introduced unified mobile/fixed licenses, allowing the nation’s CDMA opera- tors to extend their growing networks and to support full mobility. In Europe, several Scandinavian countries are examining the use of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO in the 450 MHz frequency band following its early deployment in Romania, the Czech Republic and Russia. Other opera- tors in Latin America, Africa and India are also evaluating the use of this spectrum for launching 3G services. 
In China, the government is expected to issue up to four 3G licenses at 2.1 GHz. These licenses will speed the build-out of several networks across China using WCDMA, CDMA2000 and/or TD-SCDMA. This repre- sents a dramatic growth opportunity for our Company and our industry partners who create and sell CDMA- based products and services. 
WCDMA IS RAPIDLY GAINING TRACTION 
QUALCOMM’s performance this year was greatly aided by the faster than anticipated adoption of WCDMA. We are devoting significant resources to developing WCDMA chipsets and supporting WCDMA operators worldwide, including those in Europe, Asia and the United States. Leveraging our proven success in integrating a variety 
of multimedia activities into our CDMA2000 chipsets, we have established ourselves as a significant provider of 3G WCDMA technology for wireless devices. We have the competitive advantage as pioneers of CDMA and of sharing many advanced features on our WCDMA and CDMA2000 chipsets. A key development activity is adding High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) to our WCDMA chipset solution to support the need for higher speed and higher data capacity with lower latency. We are now working with 26 WCDMA manufac- turers worldwide to enable advanced and competitively priced WCDMA mobile devices. More than 40 WCDMA devices are now commercially available, and we estimate approximately 23 million units were sold in calendar 2004. 
The recent decisions made by Sprint PCS to deploy CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and Cingular Wireless to deploy WCDMA technology in North America serve as com- pelling examples of operators realizing the competitive edge provided by 3G CDMA. As an increasing number of wireless operators around the world migrate from 2G and 2.5G legacy networks to 3G CDMA networks, the total addressable market for QUALCOMM chipset sales will rapidly expand. 
Further, the recent announcement by AT&T to re-enter the market as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) utilizing the Sprint PCS network, recognizes the value
of delivering 3G services over CDMA-based networks. The MVNO model has shown great success in Europe and now in the United States. 
FUELING INDUSTRY GROWTH 
As part of our business model, the entire QUALCOMM organization is focused on wireless leadership through a continuous cycle of envisioning, innovating and enabling. The technology roadmap created by QCT, for example, has delivered nine generations of chipsets, each one faster, more integrated and more energy efficient than those before. 
QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions® (QWBS) focuses on meeting the needs of enterprise with an ever-growing array of products and services. QUALCOMM Government Technologies (QGOV) (formerly QUALCOMM Digital Media) took a new name this year, reflecting its focus on government affiliations and services. 
QUALCOMM makes strategic investments in companies and technologies that advance the evolution and adoption of 3G wireless data services around the world. A notable example was our acquisition in calendar 2004 of Iridigm Display Corporation, a company developing technology which supports full-color, high-resolution displays with reduced power consumption that are viewable in bright daylight. This acquisition fits well with our overall strategy of rapidly increasing the capability of wireless devices while driving down cost, size and power consumption, particularly for video applications. Iridigm will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM. 
Trigenix Ltd., a mobile phone user interface company based in the United Kingdom, was acquired in calendar 2004 as a wholly owned subsidiary. When combined with our BREW client software, Trigenix’s suite of tech- nologies enables operators to differentiate their service offerings and allows users to personalize their mobile phones by choosing from a variety of themes. We expect this acquisition to be particularly helpful as we expand our presence in Europe. 
We also acquired Spike Technologies in calendar 2004, a leading semiconductor design services com- pany based in Milpitas, California with a design center in Bangalore, India. Spike will be integrated into QCT, expanding our engineering base and supporting
our effort to meet the growing worldwide demand for our products. 
We continue to advance technology by leading the evolution of existing standards and by introducing new capabilities. To substantially reduce the cost of delivering high-resolution video content, QUALCOMM recently announced an evolution of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology called Platinum Multicast and a new air interface innovation called FLOTM (Forward Link Only), both designed to lower the cost of delivering rich multimedia content to cellular devices. Additional efficiencies are provided through the MediaFLOTM media distribution system, for intelligent scheduling of content delivery, and digital rights and billing management.
The Company also announced it is forming a network operator subsidiary, MediaFLO USA Inc., to deploy a FLO technology-based multimedia multicasting or “mediacasting” network in 700 MHz spectrum in the United States. MediaFLO USA will operate the network
in cooperation with United States cellular network operators, enabling these companies to offer ever more compelling wireless multimedia services to their subscribers. Together, the CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and MediaFLO mediacasting innovations enable the deploy- ment of end-to-end systems that will drive the continuing growth of wireless multimedia services, while supporting 3G operators and content providers worldwide. 
SHARING THE REWARDS 
The continuing growth in worldwide adoption of CDMA technology has significantly increased the cash flow and earnings of QUALCOMM, and we are pleased to share this success with our stockholders. On July 13, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. The Board also authorized a 40 percent increase of quarterly dividends from 10 
to 14 cents per quarter (pre-split). The July increase marked the third dividend increase in two years. QUALCOMM’s total cash and marketable securities balance at fiscal year end has grown to approximately $7.6 billion. 
As planned, our QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) business continues to evolve with an increasing focus on investing in complementary technologies. Fiscal year 2004 revenues increased by 27 percent year-over- year.4 Fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share are $1.03, compared to $0.51 in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 diluted pro forma earnings per share excluding $0.02 earnings per share attributed to the QSI segment are $1.00.5 
Clearly, we have the financial strength and other resources needed to continue supporting customers worldwide with a broad range of new technology, chipsets, software and services. We remain focused on enhancing the wireless user experience—both consumer and enterprise—to further accelerate the growth of products and services using CDMA tech- nology. On behalf of the more than 8,000 worldwide employees of QUALCOMM who are working to achieve that goal, we thank you for your continued support.

QUALCOMM,QCOM,Info Tech,2005,"To Our Stockholders, 
For QUALCOMM, 2005 was a year of records and the achieve- ment of new milestones. Once again, we posted record financial results, further increasing our revenues, earnings and operating cash flow. We delivered new products, opened new markets and led the industry with innovations designed to cost-effectively deliver the promises of next-generation wireless. 
We announced the shipment of our two billionth chip. Seven new customers selected our WCDMA (UMTS) chipsets for their WCDMA phone products, bringing the total number of WCDMA customers to 32. In June 2005, BREW® publishers and developers reported that they had earned more than $350 million from the sale of wireless applications and services developed for operators’ BREW-based services. And we recently announced Verizon as MediaFLO’s first U.S. operator. 
We continued to invest in emerging technologies through strategic acquisitions and research and development (R&D). We completed four acquisitions this year, expand- ing our talents with an exciting new display technology, new user interface company in Europe and engineering resources in India. We announced our intent to acquire Flarion Technologies, a developer of OFDM-based mobile wireless data products. Our MediaFLOTM division conducted the first live, over-the- air demonstration of FLOTM technology. And we smoothly transitioned the management of the Company to a new leadership team. 
a catalyst for industry progress 
QUALCOMM pioneered the commercial development of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless technology. Because of its advantages in providing unmatched voice and data capac- ity and advanced capabilities for wireless networks, today CDMA serves as a foundation for enabling Third Generation (3G) services worldwide. Since our founding in 1985, our main business has been to develop, design, license, manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on CDMA. Looking forward, we are lever- aging this wireless expertise as we design systems using an increasing array of technologies, positioning the Company well to continue driving new applications for wireless. 
We have become successful by aligning our business model with others in the wireless industry value chain, including equipment manufacturers, network operators, application developers and content providers. By providing a vision for what’s possible and consistently delivering on our technology and chipset road maps, we have built a reputation that our partners can depend on. In addition to the traditional wireless suppliers, our business model has enabled new companies to enter the wireless market, creating increased competition, a faster pace of innovation and a rapid decrease in device costs, to the benefit of wireless operators and consumers. 
leading in innovation 
We have increased our R&D investment year-over-year to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the accelerating transition to 3G and the increasing industry focus on the use of wireless devices for entertainment, productivity and com- puting, in addition to traditional voice communications. 
Data usage is contributing new and valuable revenue streams to operators, and this trend is increasing the demand for even higher data rates. We continue to evolve our technology to enable increased speeds and functionality for advanced 3G systems. EV-DO, the high-speed data evolution of CDMA2000®, is already widely available, and more than 120 EV-DO device models are now being sold in South Korea, Japan and the Americas. 
We recently announced DMMXTM (DO Multicarrier Multilink eXtensions), our platform for driving the EV-DO road map through the end of the decade. Part of our DMMX strategy is to be both the leading supporter of the standards-based enhancements to EV-DO technology (Revision A and Revision B), and the leader in implementing other enhancements that significantly improve system performance but don’t require changes to standards. 
These developments will open the door to mobile voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services and very low-latency applica- tions such as push-to-talk. With DMMX, phones will operate in a concurrent “multilink” manner with multiple radio technologies (or links) while simultaneously receiving and transmitting at 
multiple frequencies (or “multicarrier”). MediaFLO is a good example of DMMX, because audio and video transmissions over cellular networks (using EV-DO or HSDPA) can be seam- lessly combined with transmissions received using the FLOTM technology operating in separate spectrum. The goal is to enable our operator partners to provide a superior multimedia experience at the lowest possible cost. 
On the WCDMA side of 3G, we are leading the development of HMMXTM (HSDPA Multicarrier Multilink eXtensions). We continue to provide our WCDMA customers and partners with products that support higher data rates through our High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) and High- Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) solutions. Through these solutions, they in turn can provide their customers with enhanced multimedia and IP-based data capabilities including multicasting. 
Additionally, we continue to focus on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technologies for mobile broad- band Internet protocol-based (IP) services. Our internal development efforts in OFDM and MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) technologies led to DO Platinum Multicast, 
which is part of the EV-DO standard, and FLO, our dedicated multicasting air interface technology which is part of the MediaFLO System. 
driving shareholder value 
The growing adoption of CDMA technology-based 3G stan- dards across many customer segments and regions around the world continues to drive strong financial results for QUALCOMM. We are very pleased with the demand for our CDMA2000 and WCDMA chipset solutions from manufacturers throughout the world. QUALCOMM earned revenues of $5.67 billion in fiscal year 2005, up 16% from fiscal 2004. Operating cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities, was $2.69 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and represented 47% of revenue. And fiscal 2005 diluted earnings per share were $1.26, compared to $1.03 in 2004. 
We continued to focus on returning capital to QUALCOMM stockholders through another increase in our quarterly cash dividend and a further increase in our stock repurchase authority to $2.5 billion. Our commitment to returning value to stockholders is evidenced by the fact that we paid $524 
million in cash dividends in fiscal year 2005 and repurchased 27.1 million shares of common stock for $953 million. QUALCOMM’s total cash and marketable securities balance at fiscal year end grew to $8.7 billion. 
To meet the large market opportunity that lies before us, we continued to invest in R&D, hire more engineers and expand our global workforce. We increased our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to meet the needs of our growing customer base. However, as a percent of revenue, SG&A expense remains modest and we continue to execute on our asset-light business model. Through these measures, we expect QUALCOMM will sustain its leadership position in innovative wireless technologies and continue to grow stockholder value. 
celebrating our heritage 
In the summer of 2005, QUALCOMM celebrated two decades of growth and accomplishment. As part of that event, we announced changes in our leadership. It was an inflection point in the evolution of our company. Dr. Irwin Jacobs stepped down from his position as chief executive officer, but continues to serve as chairman of the board of directors. The transition had been carefully organized as part of a succession plan developed by the governance committee of our board of directors. As part of the transition, Tony Thornley announced his retirement as president. Tony contributed greatly to 
the success of our company and we wish him all the best in his retirement. 
focused on the future 
As we look to the next chapter in QUALCOMM’s development, we can proceed with the confidence that our executive team and board of directors have not lost sight of the principles that have guided us thus far. We will maintain our high stan- dards for accounting controls and corporate transparency that have characterized our company since its founding. And we will continue to build on the fundamental QUALCOMM values of innovation and integrity. 
In the future, we see a world of increasingly robust and diverse wireless networks, all operating in conjunction, and supporting a wide variety of rich services, accessible by subscribers on their wireless devices. We believe the next evolution in wireless 
will be less about competing technologies and more about complementary technologies working together in a seam- less and concurrent fashion. 
Whether measured internally through our staff, or externally through our many industry partners, the main measure of our success ultimately depends on how well we enable others to succeed. To accomplish that, we will remain focused on executing on our road maps and innovating new technologies, products and services in cooperation with our partners throughout the wireless industry.

focus and dedication 
Fiscal 2006 was the first full year following the transition to our new management team. It was
a year in which a small number of competitors sought to challenge us, not in the marketplace, but in courts and regulatory arenas. We will meet these challenges with the highest level of energy and integrity while remaining dedicated to the execution of our business model. Our employees developed new technologies and defined new business models that generated new opportunities for a wider range of partners across multiple industries. Consumers adopted our third-generation (3G) technologies at an accelerating pace both in mature and developing markets. And it was a year in which we returned the strongest financial performance in our history. 
enabling progress and growth 
Our business model stimulates a healthy and competitive worldwide wireless marketplace. Our inventions enable new revenue streams for us and for our partners—manufacturers, operators, content providers and developers—enabling continuing investments throughout the wireless value chain. Our focus on effective execution and rewarding partnerships has positioned us for continued growth and leadership in the rapidly advancing global wireless industry. 
Looking ahead, we believe that, increasingly, the evolution in wireless will be less about competing technologies and more about complementary technologies—working together to provide manufac- turers and operators the richest set of choices on which to profitably build their businesses, and providing users with ever more compelling wireless applications and services. Our strategy is to continue supporting a broad range of technology and software platforms. To that end, our solutions and intellectual property portfolio now integrate multiple radio technologies, support for multiple spectrum bands and an extensive array of data and multimedia capabilities—all designed to speed the introduction by our partners of compelling new services and groundbreaking wireless devices. 
Among the trends we are seeing in the wireless industry are ubiquitous and inexpensive mobile voice, even higher data speeds and an increasingly extensive set of data services—all seamlessly integrated in an ever-increasing array of innovative devices. Wireless devices now combine the versatility and capability of a personal computer with true mobility. Enabled by today’s high-speed networks, the mobile phone is becoming a multi-functional device that supports a myriad of applications, including voice, data, multimedia and GPS location-based services, using a variety of wireless networks simultaneously. 
strong demand for technology 
Among the growth drivers for our business this year is the increasing demand for our chipsets— semiconductors and system software. In emerging markets like China and India, demand for inexpensive devices based on 3G technology is increasing. In more established markets like North America, South Korea, Japan and Europe, consumers and enterprises continue to upgrade to feature-rich 3G CDMA devices and services. 
Global demand for 3G wireless surged this year and QUALCOMM technology continues to be the key driver with industry-leading solutions targeting all addressable markets. As of November 2006, there were more than 410 million subscribers to QUALCOMM-enabled wireless networks, including approximately 320 million subscribers to networks based on CDMA2000,® the first 3G solution deployed anywhere in the world. 
As second-generation (2G) networks make the transition to advanced wireless systems, the WCDMA (UMTS) market is gaining impressive momentum, presenting an additional opportunity for us. As of November 2006, there were more than 90 million WCDMA subscribers worldwide. 
As we look to future technology deployments, our expertise and continued innovation in CDMA technology have brought us to a leading position in both CDMA2000 and WCDMA next-generation innovations. The high-speed version of CDMA2000, 1xEV-DO, is now available on 44 networks in 29 countries. For our WCDMA customers, we were first-to-market with the enhanced WCDMA next generation solution called High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), and we are pleased that our chipset customers have been the first device manufacturers to support HSDPA launches. 
Each QUALCOMM operating unit plays a key role in innovating and supporting wireless solutions that enable the wireless industry. 
The Telecommunications Industry Association adopted our FLOTM technology this year as a standard for mobile TV. More than 70 leading companies from around the world have now joined the FLO Forum, the association of wireless industry leaders which drove the FLO standardization effort. Mobile television may very well be the next “killer” application on the cell phone and we are excited to see how consumers react to the commercial introduction of MediaFLOTM in 2007 in the United States. 
focused business operations and strong results 
To ensure long-term growth for our company and industry, we aggressively invest in research and development (R&D). In fiscal 2006 we invested approximately $1.5 billion in R&D aimed at enhancing the wireless user experience and enabling exciting new services for consumers and enterprises. Our R&D efforts have provided us with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio that is made available to equipment and device manufacturers worldwide. 
In fiscal 2006, we achieved another year of record revenue, generating $7.53 billion, up 33 percent year-over-year. Through our ongoing focus on operations, our earnings have again increased. In fiscal 2006 we reported net income of $2.47 billion, up 15 percent year-over-year, and diluted earnings per share of $1.44, up 14 percent year-over-year. Operating cash flow was $3.25 billion in fiscal 2006, up 21 percent year-over-year and represented approximately 43 percent of revenue. 
Our balance sheet strength and pro-competitive business model provide us with significant financial flexibility, allowing us to pursue strategic growth objectives, pay dividends and repurchase shares in our ongoing effort to enhance stockholder value. Building on this commitment in fiscal 2006, we paid cash dividends totaling approximately $698 million and repurchased 34 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.49 billion, net of related premiums received. Our total cash and marketable securities balance grew to $9.95 billion at the end of fiscal 2006, an increase of 15 percent year-over-year. 
We are enabling the next evolution in wireless. 
continued growth and leadership 
There are significant opportunities ahead for us as more people make advanced wireless technology part of their daily lives. The large-scale migration from 2G GSM to 3G CDMA is progressing through- out the world and market forecasts anticipate considerable increases in device sales with high-speed data capability. This inevitable worldwide migration to 3G is a significant opportunity for QUALCOMM and our partners in the wireless value chain. 
On behalf of the executive team, we’d like to thank QUALCOMM’s employees and partners world- wide for their outstanding performance this year. With their help, and with support from our investors, we will continue to innovate and invest in the future of wireless.

Steady growth remains in other key regions of the world as more operators opt to provide their users with high-speed data capabilities made possible by EV-DO revisions for CDMA2000 networks and by HSDPA deployments in the WCDMA space. The CDMA Development Group reports that more than 35 new operators launched CDMA2000 networks in 2007 and low-priced, multi-featured phones are key growth drivers. Much of this growth is taking place in emerging markets where declining handset prices and increasing data capabilities are fueling demand. Our strong and ongoing commitment to Research and Development (R&D) helps ensure that wireless users have a steady flow of new devices and compelling mobile broadband services to choose from. Network operators are seeing A message from leadership We are executing on our current and long-term strategies and our success is clearly reflected in our financial results. significant increases in revenues as consumers and enterprises buy new mobile phones and wireless-enabled laptops, download applications and sign up for new services. We are executing well We continue to successfully execute on our current and long-term strategies, and these efforts are clearly reflected in every Qualcomm operating division. Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) continues to set records with chipset shipments. Thanks to QCT’s excellent efforts, iSuppli named Qualcomm the world’s top supplier of semiconductors for wireless applications. We recently strengthened our leadership position in wireless semiconductor process technology by powering the world’s first 3G handsets based on 65-nanometer chips. Among the many new products introduced this year are a low-cost single-chip solution for manufacturers of EV-DO Rev. A devices and Gobi™, an embedded global mobile Internet and GPS solution for today’s notebook computers. Our new Snapdragon platform is designed to take consumer electronics to the next level including the enabling of a whole new class of “pocket devices” with a wide range of applications and tremendous market potential. MediaFLO USA service is now available in more than 50 cities in the United States, and we remain excited about potential MediaFLO technology expansion into international markets. MediaFLO recently won the “Best TV and Video Service” award by the European Mobile Entertainment Forum, further validating FLO technology as a globally recognized open standard that provides the mass market with cost-effective, high-quality multimedia content. Our BREW business also made significant strides this year, gaining traction in WCDMA markets and supporting exciting new services. Warner Music Group is now using our comprehensive uiOne™ offering to deliver highly personalized over-the-air downloadable artist themes to their mobile customers. And Major League Baseball (MLB) became the first customer for our BREW BrandXtend™ Signature Solution, enabling fans to download baseball content to their phones directly from the MLB Web site. With Hutchison H3G, we recently launched a low-cost Skype-enabled BREW-based WCDMA phone. Qualcomm Government Technologies continues to contribute to public safety and national security by leveraging the power of advanced wireless technologies for a broad range of government agencies. Among the notable accomplishments this year was the deployment of a unique new 3G EV-DO network service to 17 jurisdictions in the National Capitol Region surrounding Washington, D.C. Wireless technology continues to transform today’s workplace, and Qualcomm Enterprise Services achieved a number of milestones this year, including the introduction of a 3G-enabled telematics solution to the construction industry in Europe and the acquisition and integration of an industry-leading machine-to-machine communications services company. We are a partner of choice The convergence of the wireless and Internet industries is creating new partnerships, evolving business models and driving innovation. As part of our efforts to enhance the mobile experience, we continue to make acquisitions and seek out new partners. Our subsidiary, Qualcomm MEMS Technologies, launched its first mirasol™ display product this year in partnership with Audiovox, a Bluetooth headset that extends battery life while delivering superior visibility, even in low-light environments. Continually working to drive increased consumer adoption of new mobile data services, in November 2007, we acquired Firethorn Holdings, LLC, an industryleading mobile banking enabler which is working with top wireless operators and financial industry partners to turn the wireless phone into a digital wallet. We announced our participation with Google in the Open Handset Alliance, an alliance of technology and mobile industry leaders whose mission is to help build the leading open-source application platform for 3G networks. The proliferation of open-source-based handsets can provide an exciting new opportunity to create compelling services and devices. As a result, we are committing R&D resources to enable the Android platform and to optimize its functionality on our chipsets. Shifting the industry dynamic Our strategy is to expand the industry by enabling as many manufacturers as possible to enter the wireless marketplace. Qualcomm exemplifies the shift of the intellectual property rights business model away from the traditional focus on technology protection to a more inclusive approach to technology licensing and proliferation. The Qualcomm Technology Licensing business funds R&D, creating wireless innovations that we have transferred to more than 140 licensees. Motivated by their own commercial considerations, some of our competitors have called our licensing policy into question, misrepresenting our business to advance their own agendas. We welcome the opportunity to clarify, defend and promote the business model that has fostered competition and increased the pace of delivering innovative new capabilities into the hands of consumers. We believe that the entire industry, including our company and our competitors, will benefit through open, rather than restricted, licensing of our patented technology. Well positioned for future growth We achieved record revenues, net income and operating cash flow in fiscal 2007 and returned a record $2.3 billion of capital to our stockholders through our cash dividend and stock repurchase program. These achievements provide market validation for the innovative products and solutions made possible by Qualcomm. Thanks to the energy and creativity of our outstanding global work force, we are well positioned for industry leadership. We will continue to lead the convergence of mobile communications, computing and consumer electronics with investments in innovative technologies that contribute to the success of our industry partners and benefit wireless users throughout the world.

QUALCOMM,QCOM,Info Tech,2008,"We are very pleased with the performance of our businesses this past year, particularly with the strong execution of our chipset business, our continued innovation and our successful settlement with Nokia. Our business is working. We shipped 336 million chipsets this year, which represents a 33 percent growth from fiscal 2007. Revenues were up 27 percent year-over-year in our chipset business and 31 percent in our licensing business, generating strong cash flows and enabling us to continue our investment in R&D. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue our tradition of leadership with new technology innovations, new market opportunities and dynamic new partners to catalyze future growth. While we continue to see strong growth in 3G CDMA and the long-term future of wireless technology is bright, the current macroeconomic conditions and potential for further economic slowdown create an uncertain business environment in the near term. The recent developments in the global economy have impacted our business and industry, as they have many other companies around the world. We anticipate a significant reduction in customer orders for our chipsets in the first half of fiscal 2009 as network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers reduce their inventories in response to the current economic slowdown. In addition, while we expect strong growth for 3G CDMA devices in calendar 2009, it is significantly less than we initially forecasted. Fiscal 2008 results included impairments to our marketable securities portfolio related to the recent disruption in the financial markets, and we have additional unrealized losses, which could result in significant additional impairments if market conditions do not improve. We have the intent to hold the majority of these securities — and we expect their value to substantially recover. Although the current economic environment is uncertain, we are fortunate to participate in a vibrant and growing industry that provides products and services that are essential to consumers and critically important to enterprises. The chipsets and patented technology developed by Qualcomm continue to be the engine for a vast spectrum of wireless devices, creating a unique position for us in the marketplace. Driving the growth of high-speed data services. Our strong R&D commitment and global engineering resources are vital to the success of our company and our industry. We continue to anticipate evolving market trends and to develop the mobile solutions of tomorrow. Our new Snapdragon™ platform (with hybrid mode alternative) is a key enabling technology for a new generation of wireless devices that reflect the convergence of communications, computing and consumer electronics. We are pleased to have more than 30 designs in development for this breakthrough technology this year, and we expect commercial products to hit the market in 2009. Our new Gobi™ mobile Internet solution (with hybrid mode alternative), a multimode chipset solution for notebook computers, enables enterprises and consumers to access the high-speed mobile Internet in virtually all parts of the world, in addition to providing GPS capabilities. Several of the world’s leading notebook manufacturers including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Toshiba and Panasonic are now embedding our solution into their products and more than 20 Gobi-enabled notebooks have been launched to date. As a founding member of Google’s Open Handset Alliance, Qualcomm is investing considerable resources to support the Android™ platform. The first commercial device enabled by this Internet-savvy operating system launched this year using our chipset. Our MediaFLO™ USA network is now providing live mobile television content to consumers via AT&T and Verizon Wireless, the two largest mobile operators in North America. Developed by Qualcomm, this groundbreaking service is putting mobile TV into the hands of consumers in 65 markets nationwide and is projected to be available in more than 100 markets by year-end 2009. Inspiring new mobile businesses. We continue to expand our strategic focus on business initiatives that support exciting new mobile services. Our Firethorn business is now collaborating with major banking institutions to make the convenience and security of the “mobile wallet” a reality for a growing number of people. Qualcomm is also working to apply the power of wireless to health and wellness, forging new partnerships and innovating new technologies with the potential to improve and prolong quality of life. We are enabling breakthrough mobile devices and solutions that enhance communications between patients and healthcare professionals, assist with a variety of remote care scenarios and enable personal health management for consumers. We believe that wireless health technologies have the power to create efficiencies and quality improvements in the healthcare system, while helping people to better manage their own health. Similarly, in areas relating to public and personal safety, we are leveraging our leadership in location based services and position-location technology to offer solutions that can be used to help track family members, business assets and even pets. 

Opening up new opportunities for mobile connectivity. Many of these initiatives are bringing new types of partners into the wireless industry ecosystem and enabling entirely new business models. Continually “mobilizing” the Web experience, Qualcomm engineers continue to inspire whole new categories of connected mobile devices, such as personal navigation devices, personal media players, cameras, e-book reading devices and pocketable computing devices. To provide appropriate infrastructure for these ideas, we are developing intelligent networks and building on our heritage as a provider of expert support services that empower our operator partners and the customers they serve. In July of 2008, we entered into a new ~15-year license agreement with Nokia, the world’s largest cell phone company, covering various wireless standards. The new license agreement reflects our strong intellectual property position across many current and future-generation technologies. Qualcomm is well positioned for future wireless opportunities as the industry moves beyond the traditional wireless phone and into powerful wireless consumer electronics and computing devices. Our scale, solid balance sheet and strong operating cash flow provides us with the unique ability to continue to invest in innovative R&D programs and next generation technologies, allowing us to grow our industry-leading product and intellectual property portfolios, improve our competitive position and open up exciting new markets for future growth.
We remain dedicated to delivering on our vision of a world in which everyone is seamlessly connected through the power and potential of wireless technology and services.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2001,"A massive shift is under way in our industry. You may think I mean the transition to a networked world. After all, IBM was one of the first to recognize this change and the impact it would have. And make no mistake, we are experiencing an explosion of technological innovation that will lead to permanent changes in business, government, education, health care and every other area of human endeavor —as every significant institution, every product and service, as well as billions of people, become permanently “connected.” But that’s not the shift I’m talking about. The revolution I’m describing is that customers are finally driving the direction of the information technology industry. Technologists Talking to Technologists The first 30 years of this industry’s history consisted of the technology inventors inside I/T companies talking to the technology implementers inside businesses and institutions. For most of that era, the applications of the technology were fairly limited— focused on the automation of back-office processes like accounting and payroll, or desktop applications such as word processing and e-mail. Then, starting in the early 1990s, businesspeople began to understand the importance of information technology to everything they wanted to do. It’s gotten to the point where it’s almost impossible to distinguish between the business strategy and the I/T strategy of any successful enterprise. Approximately half of the investments that customers make in I/T are now driven by line-of-business managers, not chief information officers. This is a remarkable shift in just five or six years. Not that CIOs have become unimportant. They now sit at the table where technology is translated into business value. And their traditional bailiwick of infrastructure, too, has been transformed by the networked world. But there’s no question that business strategy now sets the technology agenda, not the other way around. Prior to joining IBM, my career as a management consultant and executive took me inside the inner workings of many industries. So I was surprised, on entering this one, to learn that the computer industry had been able to get away with inventing new things and just “throwing them over the wall,” leaving customers to figure out how to integrate and apply them. That wasn’t easy for those customers, for a lot of reasons. One was the absence of common standards. The industry model was designed around a variety of proprietary architectures (which, to be candid, technology providers were using to control customers). This came as quite a shock to me, since all my prior experience had taught me that you either give the customer what he or she wants, or the customer walks. Well, guess what? Customers have finally put on their walking shoes. They’ve made it emphatically clear to this industry that they will no longer cede control to the makers of the technology. That means customers are demanding integration, and refusing to accept piece parts that aren’t designed and delivered to work together. It means they are demanding solutions, not “speeds and feeds.” And it means they insist that the technology adapt itself to the needs of their business and help them gain some tangible competitive advantage—to squeeze cost from their supply chains, to create lasting relationships with customers, to empower their key constituencies (internal and external) with tools and knowledge. A Tale of Two Revolutions So the past decade hasn’t seen just one major shift, it’s seen two. For IBM, this was good news. Even in the depths of our decline, in 1993, it was obvious that no other company had both the technical expertise to win product battles against competitors and the business knowledge to become a trusted partner for its customers. Contrary to the conventional wisdom of pundits, analysts, the media (and, of course, our rivals), IBM still had a raison d’être. Of course, we had to unlock both capabilities, and, in fact, make them feed each other. That goal—creating a business model that uniquely combines technical and business innovation, a company with one foot in the lab and one in the boardroom—underpins the new IBM we set out to build. Thus, the big decision we made early on —to reverse the then-current plan to break up the company and commit instead to making all of IBM’s parts work together—was a fairly easy one. It didn’t involve a lot of research or market analysis. The real question in my mind was not “Should IBM exist?” but rather, “Can we become what this new era demands?” Put another way: Could we aspire to lead again? I can’t think of many companies, in any industry, that have led two eras. But I can tell you now that, even in the dark days, we began believing that we could defy history. Of course, that’s like deciding to climb Mount Everest. You still have to climb the mountain! And we weren’t starting our trek from an elevated base camp, or even from sea level. This annual report captures a sense of the sheer range of what was involved to pull it off. Through it all, our guiding light came down to two words: customer focus. It has proved both galvanizing and clarifying, serving as the criterion for reexamining a whole lot of dogma, and for resolving many of our seemingly intractable internal debates. Was it okay for IBM Global Services to recommend competitors’ hardware or software? Should the IBM software business develop solutions for Sun or HP servers? How about letting our hardware units support Oracle or Microsoft products? In every case, the answer was: We’ll do what customers want. Once we started really listening to customers, it’s striking how many aspects of our business improved— and not just on the market-facing side, but also in procurement, with our suppliers and even in technology, where the quality and quantity of our output have benefited enormously from exposure to the marketplace. This is important. The relationship between business and technology isn’t one-way. Technology itself isn’t some force of nature that we simply direct or use. It, too, is the product of human intentionality and choice. So yes, we apply technology to solve customer problems. And we also apply marketplace knowledge to help shape our research agenda—whether it’s the direction of the economy, or growth opportunities, or emerging forms of governance and education, or demographic and social trends, or discoveries in other fields such as life sciences. A decade ago, the two were disconnected—and one of them was running amok. Technology was being pursued for
its own sake, and was either buried in labs (in the case of IBM), or generating premature visions of business triumph (in the “build it and they will come” fantasies of the dot-com paper billionaires and “new economy” moguls). We needed to reassert a proper balance. And that led, in IBM, to a handful of strategic bets on the future drivers of our industry. I would highlight four. 1. THE NEW INDUSTRY MODEL: Innovate or Integrate To survive, you have to do one or the other really well. To lead, you have to do both. The vertical integration of the technology industry in the ’60s and ’70s had given way by the early 1990s to a dizzying array of “pure play” companies (specialists in PCs, databases, application software and the like). This explosion of entrepreneurial and technical creativity was, on the one hand, a testament to our industry’s enduring power. It’s a well that will never run dry. Businesses, however, desperately needed someone to help them make sense of this chaos. Hence, the emergence over the past several years of technology integrators— and the rush of traditional professional services companies into e-business consulting. As I/T moves out of the back office and into the executive suite, value and growth in our industry are driven less than they used to be by technical innovation or product excellence, as necessary as those remain. What matters most today is the ability to integrate technology into the lifeblood of business. The people who help customers apply technology to transform their businesses have increasing influence over everything from architecture and standards to hardware and software choices and partners. 2. THE NEW BUSINESS MODEL: Services-Led A lot of people now understand the lead role played by I/T services. However, building up the requisite skill base, not to mention an appropriately sophisticated management system, is nontrivial. You can’t buy your way into it, or just go out and hire a lot of smart people. You need a certain scale and range of disciplines. Also, you can’t just layer one kind of expertise on top of another. This isn’t just filling up two beakers, one labeled “customer” and the other labeled “technology.” It takes years and a lot of knowledge to be able to mix those elements properly. Plus, services is rapidly expanding and evolving in some surprising ways. It now encompasses not just laborintensive consulting, but also the utility-like delivery of computing—from applications, to processing, to storage. We see the beginnings of this trend in Web hosting and our own “e-business on demand” offerings, where customers don’t buy computers, but acquire computing services over the Net, on a pay-for-use basis. To play here, as well as in the globally booming strategic outsourcing arena, you have to be willing and able to use your balance sheet to support growth. IBM, of course, had deep experience in I/T services. But in our old business model, it was buried inside a revenue stream dependent on selling hardware. We had to extract our service operations and turn them into a profit center in their own right. That involved a lot of trial and error. But today, IBM Global Services has evolved into the world’s largest and most innovative consultancy, systems integrator and strategic outsourcing leader. 
3. THE NEW COMPUTING MODEL: Infrastructure Plus Ubiquity It became clear to some of us in the mid-’90s that the PCdriven, client/server computing model had run its course, and was being replaced by network-based, distributed computing. This meant that, on one end of the scale, the workload was moving back to the infrastructure— to industrial-strength servers, storage, databases and transaction-management systems. On the client end, it has spawned a proliferation of network-connected devices of all kinds: PDAs, cell phones, videogame systems, set-top boxes and beyond— to the whole pervasive-computing world of embedded components in everything from household appliances, to medical devices, to cars. And tying it all together was an emerging category of software with a wonderfully descriptive name, which hardly anybody had heard of five years ago—middleware. It stood to reason that, in a distributed model, profitability would be distributed, too. So we zeroed in on three sweet spots of the new computing “stack”: enterprise systems, integrating middleware, and the specialized, high-value components (such as custom chips) that turn every sort of device into a computer. This is anything but a “portfolio” approach. We’re not just hedging our bets, and we’re certainly not trying to be all things to all people. Our choices have been about both what businesses to pursue aggressively, and what ones to exit (such as enterprise application software and networking hardware). • In enterprise systems, we retooled our storage family and entirely revamped and consolidated our server lines. And, let the record note, we didn’t accept another piece of conventional wisdom— we didn’t give up on the mainframe. Like IBM, it’s back— transformed, more powerful, and doing quite nicely. • In software, through acquisition and internal development, we built the biggest middleware business in the world. That’s fortunate, because middleware—which helps customers integrate their applications and processes— has emerged as the fastest-growing sector of the software industry. As a development platform, it’s becoming more important than operating systems. And that, in turn, has helped IBM Software to become more deeply integrated into the wider software industry than ever before, much better positioned to share in its future growth. • In component technology, what began as a search for a new revenue stream to support our R&D expenses turned into a significant growth engine in its own right—our OEM, or original equipment manufacturer, business. Yes, that part of IBM has been hit by the general downturn in technology purchasing. But we remain confident in the long-term future of the business, which is based on exactly the kinds of specialized components for which demand will be greatest in a post-PC world. Of course, we are no longer alone in drawing this new computing model. But while pretty much everyone now agrees on the outlines, there is much disagreement about the approach. Basically, it comes down to whether you believe in interoperability and common standards or not. We have certainly placed our bet. 4. THE NEW MARKETPLACE MODEL: An Open Playing Field A lot of companies — including many of our leading competitors—still don’t acknowledge or fully understand that common standards are essential in a networked
world, and that no one will ever again control customers through proprietary technology. We can certainly appreciate their struggle. We’ve had to turn a company that long ago made its fortune from proprietary technologies into one that saw the benefits of openness. Maybe it’s precisely because we were so acutely aware of the siren call of proprietary control that we have learned to resist it. But one thing is apparent: In a customer-driven world, open architectures and common standards are inevitable. Today, we are focusing all our technical expertise and marketing energy— previously devoted to creating and marketing self-sufficient systems—toward reimagining and rebuilding them for open platforms. We now share our emerging software products with the developer community; license our technology and patents; and champion common standards at all levels, from Linux, to Java, to Web services. Most important of all was the work we undertook to open up our technical architectures. Absolutely every piece of IBM hardware and software today is a fundamentally different beast (and a more socialized one) than it was ten years ago. We know what it’s like to be on the wrong side of history. The future won’t be kind to those who ignore this lesson. *** Put these models together, and you see a changed competitive landscape with very new dynamics. There will be a different lineup of winners and losers. And at the head of the pack, we will see the emergence of a new type of enterprise with a whole new type of corporate culture. We’ve been building such a company for nearly a decade: big but fast; entrepreneurial and disciplined; at once scientific and market-driven; able to create intellectual capital on a worldwide scale, and to deliver it to a customer of one. This new breed continually learns, changes and renews itself. It is tough and focused—but open to new ideas. It abhors bureaucracy, dissembling and politicking. It rewards results. Above all, it covets talent and passion for everything it does. It’s hard work—the hardest any business can undertake, in my view—but we’re making good progress. From a changed approach to hiring and performance-based compensation; to groundbreaking work on distance learning; to providing the tools, opportunities and flexibility for employees to control their own work/life balance; we are creating not just the theory, but also the practice— and the mindset—of a true e-business. This is a very different place from the one I joined nine years ago, in many ways that are obvious, even to the casual observer—and in some that aren’t, even to the observant insider. It is smarter, more unified and much, much faster. Instead of consistently resisting change, more IBMers now lead it. Our employee population is as skilled and comfortable collaborating online—across geographies, functions, roles— as any I’ve seen. And we are even learning to make a virtue of our size and complexity, becoming more adept at working the matrix to get things done. Farewell Nine years! As must be obvious by now, I am not exactly ready for retirement. And I would love nothing better than to help drive, and learn from, all that I see happening in the laboratories of IBM and the work we’re doing with
customers—everything from “smart dust” to e-sourcing, from global e-learning to e-government, from life sciences to grid computing. What a world is hurtling toward us! However, a decade or so is long enough to be the leader of a large, complex company like IBM. To win in this industry, you’ve got to get out in front of the big shifts that come along about every ten years. You need fresh thinking and the courage to lead wrenching change. With e-business, we caught the wave early. We bet the company on the networked world, and that will serve IBM well for years. But I’m sure that Sam will face, during his long and illustrious career, another major shift. When it comes, I hope he throws out everything Gerstner ever did. Adjusting to the market’s evolution is why IBM is now succeeding — just as an inability to do so was once IBM’s fundamental failure. We see fascinating hints already of the company IBM will become. I am confident that, with Sam Palmisano’s leadership, the best is yet to come. As Chairman of the Board for the remainder of this year, I will continue to be involved in any way that Sam desires. But my time as IBM’s leader is over. It has been an enormously exhilarating run, and I have learned more, much more, than I ever expected. I don’t comfortably express my deepest feelings in public. So let me just say, to all my colleagues, all our loyal customers, all our invaluable partners, and to my friend and worthy successor—thank you. Thanks to the IBM customers who rooted for us to come back from the brink. Thanks to our shareholders, who took the time to understand what was happening in IBM against the backdrop of industry change. Thanks to a smart, committed board of directors, who provided wisdom, guidance and support for an agenda full of risk-taking change. Thanks to the many IBM executives who gave me a chance, who helped me learn and supported me in the early days —when they could very easily have been antibodies resisting this invader from outside. And, thanks —320,000 thanks—to all my colleagues in this magnificent company. No matter what the challenge— from IBM’s own near-death experience, to Y2K, to dot-com mania, to recession, to 9/11—IBM employees blessed all of us with their grit, their passion, their compassion and their class. I’m proud to have served and worked with all of you. I’m grateful for all that you’ve taught me, and for sharing with me the business opportunity of a lifetime. And now—go get ’em.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2002,"Dear IBM Investor, when i joined ibm, it was one of the most respected, innovative and successful companies in the world. That was, in large part, because of the way Tom Watson, Sr., IBM’s founder, had shaped it. He nurtured a unique culture, a progressive set of values and the aspiration to make a difference in the world. The company’s position had been further enhanced in the 1960s, when Tom Watson, Jr., took a daring, “bet-the-company” gamble on the System/360 mainframe. It revolutionized computing and transformed the way business was done. It also spurred a radical reinvention of IBM and propelled the company to worldwide commercial leadership for two decades.

Of course, you know that IBM stumbled badly in the early 1990s, largely because it strayed from its values and stopped listening—to customers and to its own smart people. As a consequence, the company failed to reinvent itself for new realities. Under Lou Gerstner’s leadership, the people of IBM rebuilt their company. It has come back a long way. Today, as I reflect on my first year as chief executive, I believe we stand our best chance in decades of returning IBM to a position of leadership—in all the ways that a business should lead. I want to talk to you about that in this letter. It’s important that you understand how we define leadership for IBM, because it is the context for understanding what we accomplished in 2002 and the framework for how we will manage IBM in the decade ahead. seizing the moment There’s no question that 2002 tested our company. We had to deal with a continuing tough economic climate, particularly for the information technology industry, which contracted for the second year in a row. Although our revenue from continuing operations of $81.2 billion was off 2 percent from 2001 and our earnings decreased 35 percent, to $5.3 billion, all of our core businesses—from servers to storage systems, to middleware, to services—gained marketshare in 2002. This is important. It means we will emerge in an even stronger position, relative to our competitors. An environment like this, for all its challenges, is the ideal time to make decisive moves for future growth. Because of our ability to generate strong cash flows, last year we invested $4.8 billion in research and development, $4.8 billion in capital expenditures and $4 billion in acquisitions. We took advantage of reasonable valuation levels and acquired several companies, including PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting and six strategic software firms. Early this year, we acquired Rational, a leader in software development tools, for $2.1 billion. We opened the most advanced semiconductor development and manufacturing facility in the world. And we also improved our competitiveness. We revamped our PC and microelectronics businesses, and both our Personal Systems and Technology segments had returned to profitability by the fourth quarter. Our inventory levels now stand at a 20-year low. Through progress on our integrated supply chain, we took $5.6 billion in costs out of the business, and we believe we’ll achieve about the same this year. One of the most important investments we made in 2002 was to contribute just under $4 billion, in cash and IBM stock, to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation of our U.S. pension plan—which was underfunded mainly due to low interest rates and continued weakness in capital markets. After all of these investments, we had sufficient cash to return to shareholders directly—$1 billion in dividend payments—and indirectly—$4.2 billion in repurchased IBM common stock. Add it up, and the people of IBM turned in a solid performance, despite a most difficult year. That performance was reflected in our market value. While our stock price was down year to year—and no one is pleased about that—it held up better than those of all our principal competitors. However, the meaning of 2002 goes beyond the blocking, tackling and individual actions I’ve briefly described. I believe that years from now we will see 2002 as the year we fundamentally repositioned IBM for leadership—leadership in an industry that will be very different when it comes out of the current economic slump. a new game for information technology In some ways, the IT industry will remain familiar. It will still thrive on fundamental technology innovation—an area of unparalleled strength for your company. In 2002, IBM scientists and engineers scored their tenth straight year as the world’s most prolific inventors, earning 3,288 U.S. patents, nearly double the number of the next closest company. Over the past decade, the U.S. Patent Office has issued IBM 22,357 patents—more than for ten of our top U.S. competitors combined. But in other profound ways, the industry will be very different. How? Most people don’t realize it, but the IT industry has always been two, interrelated industries. One, of course, is computing. This is more than the chips, databases, operating systems, application software and other technology elements that are in a constant state of change. This is about computing as an architecture, a model, a system—what all of those individual pieces, when put together, make possible. The computing model doesn’t change very often, but it’s changing now. The other “industry” is the application of computing to improve or transform some aspect of business (and by “business,” I mean the work of every kind of enterprise and institution). This wasn’t visible for many years, because these services—helping customers apply and manage the technology—were bundled with the hardware or software. But it was there all the same, and hugely important. For example, although IBM pioneered the mainframe model of computing, it would not have taken the market by storm if we had only brought customers a new machine. We had to bring them a new idea about business, and we had to show them how to apply mainframe systems to transform back-office functions like accounting, payroll and inventory management. I don’t think it’s an overstatement to say that IBM has been unique in stepping to the forefront of both these capabilities—computing and its application to business—for most of IT’s history. Today, once again, both are changing in significant and interconnected ways. Consider what’s happening in computing. Our customers have stopped thinking of their technology needs just in terms of data centers, or storage systems, or PCs, or even the network. Today, it’s the entire technical infrastructure on which their businesses run, a vital infrastructure that must connect with and support relationships and transactions with other businesses, devices of all kinds and all the people using those devices. My point is, if customers are going to look to you as the leader in computing, you have to be able to drive forward the entire computing agenda, not just a piece of it. We see a parallel situation in how computing is being applied by customers. For the most part, businesses and institutions have automated and digitized their standalone operations and processes—the back office, the manufacturing floor, procurement, logistics, customer-facing systems. They’ve extracted great efficiencies by doing so. Now they want to transform processes that cut across all of those systems. Why? Because they want to build a business that can respond dynamically to whatever the world throws at it. And goodness knows, the world has been doing a lot of throwing lately. a new game for business All of this is what we mean by “e-business on demand,” which you will be hearing a lot about in the months and years to come. The promise of on demand is that a company or institution can provide products, services, information, health care, education, government services and so on—all “on demand” for customers, citizens, patients and students. These “sense-and-respond” or “real-time” enterprises enjoy enormous competitive advantages. They are able to convert fixed costs into variable costs. They can greatly reduce inventories. And, most compellingly, they are extremely responsive to the needs of their customers, employees and partners. That is obviously very appealing, especially in times like these. However, consider the magnitude of the business transformation it requires. It’s almost as if a business were turned on its side— moving from a collection of vertical “silos” to a seamlessly integrated, horizontal flow across value chains. That’s a major, major shift—in business design and in management thinking—and pulling it off requires deep business expertise and know-how. This may sound rather grandiose, to some. And, of course, all technology companies envision ways in which their products will change business and society. Most do so with great bravado. More often than not, though, they are just plain wrong. The dot-com era was just the latest reminder that creators of databases, PCs and printers have no special qualifications to understand the future of serious business. In fact, they are probably the last people customers should look to for this kind of insight. To be honest, when we at IBM began to understand the future course of technology and its sweeping implications for business, we looked in the mirror and saw some serious deficiencies in our own company. True, we had in recent years built up quite a bit of consulting capability. But we lacked a critical mass of business expertise to help our customers become on demand enterprises. It was this realization that drove us to acquire PwC Consulting. We now have nearly 60,000 professionals in industries ranging from financial services to health care, with business process expertise in areas like supply chain, customer relationship management, human capital solutions and business transformation outsourcing. We considered forming a web of alliances to gain the business insight we lacked. Others have chosen this path, and it’s a perfectly respectable strategy—but not for us. IBM’s brand and business model are very different from those of our competitors. Fundamental to our identity as a corporation is this fusion of business insight and technology leadership. Our learning in each realm informs what we do in the other. So we need an intimate linkage between them. leadership on demand We have mobilized the entire IBM company and our expanding network of partners to make our e-business on demand strategy a reality. That work comes down to three main thrusts: 1. Helping our customers become “on demand businesses.” Through IBM Global Services, we are applying IBM’s considerable business process and industry expertise to help customers build businesses that are almost intuitive in their responsiveness to changes in demand, supply, pricing, labor, capital markets and customer needs. This requires a great deal of integration—of business processes and operations, and of applications and the underlying IT systems. It means making them resilient in the face of changes and threats, from hackers to hurricanes. And it means helping them focus on what differentiates them, on their core competencies—and outsource or tightly integrate with strategic partners to supply the rest. 2. Evolving the computing model to an On Demand Operating Environment. On demand business creates new rules for IT infrastructure. Computing must be integrated and must support integration of business processes and operations, which is why our WebSphere software is growing so rapidly. Computing must be built on open technical standards and platforms, which is why IBM will continue to be a leader of the open standards movement—a leader in Linux, Web services and other emerging technical standards. Applications must be developed for this new, open model, which is why we acquired Rational; it gives software developers a compelling alternative to proprietary approaches. In addition, an emerging technology called grid computing, built around another set of open specifications, allows the sharing and managing of separate computing resources as if they were one huge, virtual computer. This will dramatically increase utilization rates and give customers access to enormous computing capacity. Finally, IBM technologists are also pioneering ways to make IT systems “autonomic”—more self-managing and self-healing. This, too, is critical, as the increasing complexity of systems is making them unrealistically costly to manage and maintain. 3. Establishing utility computing—computing on demand—as a viable and attractive alternative for accessing and paying for IT. This effort has gotten a lot of attention. Yes, we intend to be a leader in utility computing services, so that customers can acquire computing and applications and pay only for what they use. IBM Global Services is already pioneering such services—server and storage capacity, as well as business processes like procurement and claims processing—for companies such as American Express, The Dow Chemical Company and Mobil Travel Guide. But we also want to equip and help customers to build their own internal utilities— software to manage and balance workloads, and server and storage systems to provide additional capacity on demand. Clearly, the bet we’re placing on e-business on demand is a big one. And part of what makes it big is that it encompasses where both computing and business are headed. Driving both at the same time requires a lot of work, but it’s necessary, if you aspire to lead this industry. ibm’s center of gravity Throughout IBM’s history, we have reinvented ourselves over and over again. The most visible manifestation of this has been how radically our product line has changed over time—from clocks and scales to tabulating machines, to mainframes, to Selectric typewriters, to everything we do today. How were we able to make those transitions without having a jarring identity crisis? It’s because we never defined ourselves as a clock and scale company, or a mainframe company, or a typewriter maker, even when we were the undisputed leader in those markets. We simply committed ourselves to being the leader in inventing state-of-the-art technology and helping customers apply it to solve their problems. When technology and the nature of customer problems change—we do, too. As I said earlier, the one time we forgot that and held on too long to products and ideas that were giving way to new ones, we nearly lost the whole ball game. That’s a lesson we will not forget. Today, with e-business on demand, we are again redefining the value we bring to customers. It’s driving us to grow certain businesses aggressively—especially services and software—and to de-emphasize others, as we did in 2002. I have no doubt whatsoever that 15 or 20 years from now, we will be in a bunch of new and different businesses, because technology and customer problems will have marched on, hopefully with our company at the forefront. But we will still be IBM. the purpose of a business As you might guess by now, we have been doing a lot of thinking about what leadership means for IBM. To lead our industry, we must be the company to which our customers look to understand the future of IT and how it can help them create business value. But there are additional aspects of leadership that are also important aspirations for our company: as an investment, as an employer, as a member of the community. Now, companies often say that being a great employer or a responsible citizen is as important to them as creating shareholder value or delighting customers or beating competitors. But they don’t elevate them as business priorities, to be managed with the same kind of investment and discipline— and competitive passion—that they apply to managing R&D, manufacturing and sales. We do. Why? Because over time, failure to understand change in these realms can be as damaging as failure to stay abreast of markets or technology. Maybe more so. What do investors value? What will attract and motivate the best workforce in the world? What do communities—nations and neighbors—expect of companies? As with technology and customer requirements, these are all moving targets. We believe investors, particularly those who invest in the technology sector, reward companies that adapt, that continually create and lead the high-value spaces—because that’s the only way to deliver consistent, long-term earnings growth in an industry that is constantly evolving. We believe investors reward companies that manage for the long haul, run highly efficient operations and are managed by experienced and disciplined leaders. And, at a time when industry growth projections are highly unreliable, investors reward companies that outperform their competitors—no matter the rate at which the industry is growing or contracting. This is why we have made marketshare a top priority. I joined a company that was the place to work. It was progressive, fair and principled, and it invested in its people and their development. All of that stemmed from the commitment to have the best talent in the world, a commitment we reaffirm today. How you achieve that with programs and benefits depends on the times. As the composition of the workforce and their expectations changed, so did IBM, often far ahead of other companies or government mandates. We know that employees today value flexibility and mobility, yet they want to feel part of a team, a community of colleagues. They value skill enhancement, but they want lifelong learning, not just classroom training. Most of all, while they are attracted to IBM’s breadth and global presence, they don’t want to get lost in a big company. They want to make a difference, have impact. All of this represents opportunities for us once again to innovate as an employer. Finally, we need to adapt if we aspire to be a respected and engaged participant in our communities. This is more, far more, than philanthropy— although IBM takes a back seat to no one in contributions and volunteerism. (IBMers volunteered four million hours last year.) It’s about building relationships based on respect, trust and integrity—IBM’s bedrock values. And it’s about using our remarkable scientific, managerial and analytic assets—some of the best minds on the planet—to help local, national and international communities solve problems and stimulate economic growth. Right now, we have as many questions as answers, and more a sense of where we must go as a company than a clear path to get there. Yet we believe these are all appropriate and worthy aspirations for IBM and IBMers. They are consistent with the kind of company we want to be and have been for most of our history. This is IBM’s DNA. The challenge, of course, is to bring the best of that forward without for a moment taking our eye off the customer, marketplace execution and strong results. In the end, this goal of leadership, broadly defined, is what makes our company unique. It’s why people come to work at IBM—and why millions more have wanted to be associated with it. There are certainly many places where a person can earn a very good living and build a highly gratifying career. You come to a big, complex company like ours if you want to be part of something whose impact is larger. And you come to this particular enterprise to be part of something whose impact will last, a company that explores, a company that matters. That was the company I joined 30 years ago. Yes, the world has changed, and there’s no going back. But my 316,000 colleagues welcome the challenge. We are determined to make IBM a truly great company—a great partner, investment and employer—for our generation and for our times.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2003,"Dear IBM Investor, Last year, I told you that we were repositioning IBM for leadership, in all the ways that a business can lead. I described how IBM defines leadership, along with our plans to achieve it. And I said that I believed the results of this repositioning would roll out in meaningful ways in the years and decades to come. 

twelve months later, it’s clear that the future we envisioned is arriving, and more rapidly than we expected. This is in part because of the hopeful signs we’re seeing of economic recovery, with the promise of renewed business investment in information technology. It’s partly because of the rapid adoption of our on demand strategy by clients, partners and the overall IT industry. But it’s also something more—something specific to this company and its people, and something longer lasting than a particular economic cycle. IBM today is a very different enterprise than it was just a few years ago. Our business model has been quietly but substantially reshaped to capitalize on the most promising growth and profit opportunities in the market. Even more important for the long term, our operations and culture are being transformed as well. We are now focused with an intensity and unity I haven’t seen since the heyday of the mainframe. As a result, we are poised to take IBM to the next level, and to redraw and extend the boundaries of the IT industry. A very good year, for a very different company IBM’s 2003 is the kind of year on which it’s gratifying to look back—both for our overall achievements and for the strong momentum with which we ended the year. Our revenue from continuing operations, at $89.1 billion (a company record), increased by 10 percent. Earnings from continuing operations were $7.6 billion compared to $5.3 billion in 2002, which included $1.6 billion of after-tax charges for second and fourth quarter 2002 actions. We continued to gain market share across all our core businesses. IBM today is the market leader in servers, middleware, business transformation services and strategic outsourcing. Highlights for the year included revenue growth in every server segment, a WebSphere middleware platform that grew 12 percent and gained market share, and 14 percent growth in strategic outsourcing. Our success with clients was evident in faster-thanmarket growth for five of IBM’s six industry sectors. For example, in the public sector, which includes our relationships with governments and health care providers, we grew by 15 percent; in communications by 8 percent; in industrial by 14 percent; and in financial services by 13 percent. We again generated excellent cash flows. After investing $5.1 billion in R&D, we had $12.7 billion in cash available for investment and distribution to shareholders. We invested $3.9 billion of that in net capital expenditures and $1.8 billion in acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio. And we were able to return $5.4 billion to investors—$4.3 billion through share repurchase and $1.1 billion through dividends—ending the year in a strong cash position, with $7.6 billion, including marketable securities. Overall, despite facing serious challenges, the IBM team executed with discipline. And indications for the year ahead are encouraging, including a strong demand pipeline (enlarged by more than $17 billion of services signings in the fourth quarter) and a growing number of alliances with business partners and software companies committed to leading with IBM’s open, standards-based platforms. All in all, a very good performance. But is it sustainable? Can we, in fact, improve upon it and keep growing for the foreseeable future? I believe so, and let me tell you why. Recommitting to high value For the past couple of decades, if you were to look at IBM’s performance in any given year or over several years, what would you see? You’d see a very large global company in which some businesses are growing rapidly, some are flat and some are declining. Add it up, and it would average out to steady profitability—but perhaps uninspiring growth. For people with comparatively short memories, this might be the only IBM they’d ever known. And it would be legitimate to ask if the company is capable of more. The answer is: We certainly are. In fact, over most of our nearly 100-year history, IBM was consistently a company that outperformed others in our markets and generated superior returns. And that was because we were singularly focused on leading, and most often creating and defining, the high-value spaces in our industry. Of course, with a company of IBM’s breadth and global presence, there are always ups and downs that result from economic cycles, product and technology transitions, and sometimes issues of execution. But it’s also apparent that, somewhere along the line, we became more focused on defending our existing leadership position than on creating the next one. We weren’t particularly bold or imaginative in getting into new markets or developing new businesses, products and services, even when our strategic analyses indicated that something new was coming. And, just as important, we hesitated to reinvent or get out of businesses that no longer represented high value for either clients or shareholders. In a word, we lost sight of IBM’s mission, of what had always set us apart. Well, we’ve regained our focus now. IBM is an innovator—in every dimension of that word. We know that IBM and IBMers are at their best when they create value that our clients cannot get from anyone else. That means we will provide leading-edge technology, services, expertise and intellectual capital, and will integrate these capabilities for each client to provide them with competitive advantage. We commit to that. We commit to innovating to deliver client success. And that is something for which clients are willing to pay a premium. This may seem like a truism, but it actually commits us to a very focused strategy, based on a choice between the two primary sources of growth and profit in IT today: the high-volume, undifferentiated product play; and the high-value, innovation and integration play, focused on the enterprise. It is this high-value space we have chosen to lead. We believe this is the right choice for IBM and our investors. By focusing on this space, we believe we can, on a sustainable, long-term basis, generate superior returns compared to the overall IT industry, command leading share position in our selected businesses, outperform the average of the S&P 500 on return on invested capital, and produce strong cash flows. In recent years, we’ve taken many steps to seize this position. Before I talk about those steps, I want to spend a minute on what constitutes “high value” for clients today, and what will do so for the foreseeable future. It’s embodied in what we call the on demand enterprise. And that, in turn, is all about a new kind of integration. The next wave of integration After two decades of disaggregation, the IT industry is re-integrating. This is being driven simultaneously by a major shift in client demand, and a major shift in technology. Companies have come to realize that if they’re going to respond rapidly and effectively to today’s volatile marketplace, they need to do more than Web-enable discrete systems, processes or business units. They need to pull together all of the systems they’ve already got and integrate them securely with their core business activities—horizontally, across not just their whole company but their entire value chain, from customers to suppliers. This is an on demand enterprise.
Becoming one is dauntingly hard to pull off. It requires both the end-to-end integration of the technology—which niche product vendors simply cannot do—and the integration of technology with business processes. This in turn requires deep business knowledge and industry expertise that few traditional technology companies have, and significant technical knowledge and research strengths that few consulting firms possess. Integration is also an emerging force in core technology and computing architectures. To cite one example, advances in semiconductor devices have been largely propelled by increasing the clock speed of the microprocessor chip; this is like revving up the RPM of a car engine. But while advances in raw speed are continuing apace, they are no longer enough to increase chip and overall system performance. For one thing, chips have become so densely packed with transistors that they produce more heat than can be cost-effectively dissipated. The solution is integration—putting multiple, often less-than-top-speed processors on the same chip, along with additional functions like fast memory and highperformance input/output. This is the approach IBM engineers have taken in developing our Blue Gene supercomputer. Integration of this sophistication is beyond the reach of most chip and systems companies. It requires expertise not just in semiconductors but in advanced systems architecture, custom logic design, operating systems and software tools. This is the kind of expertise that IBM has built up over decades, and it is not easily replicated. And that’s why technology leaders like Sony, Cisco, Apple and QUALCOMM have partnered with IBM for advanced technology—and why last year Microsoft licensed IBM’s microprocessor technology for use in its next-generation Xbox game console. Bulking up in on demand Many IT companies will struggle with this world that is dawning—with the need to choose between open and proprietary, between serving consumers and enterprises, between redistributing other people’s intellectual capital and innovating. This is not about making pronouncements or promises. A company cannot be all things to every client, every partner and every investor. For our part, we’ve decided. The two parallel trajectories of integration—in client demand and in what the technology requires—play directly to IBM’s historic strengths. However, even with everything IBM brought to this table, we needed more. That’s why we’ve made acquisitions such as PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (PwCC), Rational software and 19 other companies in the past two years. And it’s why we reset our priorities in R&D to develop more technologies and services specifically for client needs in the on demand era. On demand integration is also why we’ve placed a huge bet on standards, from the Internet protocols and Linux to grid computing and Web services. Without open technical interfaces and agreed-upon standards, even integration within a single enterprise would remain a gargantuan task. And forget about integration with the other companies, business processes, applications, pervasive computing devices, laws, regulations, customs and cultures that make up the ever-more-global marketplace of the 21st century. An IT company’s position on open standards—not just its rhetoric, but its actions—is a clear indicator of whether it faces forward or backward, is serving the needs of clients or protecting its market position. In addition to the opportunities I’ve described, our move into on demand has opened up some very large businesses beyond the frontiers of the traditional IT industry—opportunities that remain out of reach for most of our competitors. One promising example is Business Transformation Outsourcing (BTO), which was not even part of the industry lexicon 18 months ago. In BTO engagements, IBM becomes responsible for transforming—and actually providing—a client’s business process in areas such as human resources, procurement, customer care, and finance and administration. Thanks to the acquisition of PwCC and the formation of IBM Business Consulting Services, we generated nearly $3 billion in BTO signings during the fourth quarter of 2003 alone. To give a rough idea of the potential here, the current size of businesses’ outsourced spending on sales, marketing, logistics, finance, HR and all other administrative processes is about $1 trillion a year. Of that, there is an opportunity in excess of $1oo billion in the BTO areas we are pursuing. We are committed to extend our leadership position in BTO in 2004.
Remaking IBM To some people, it may seem bold to have made all these moves during the worst market ever seen in the IT industry. But I don’t believe it was particularly risky, because it was driven by client demand and the realities of the technology. What’s really important for you to understand is that our commitment to leadership in the high-value spaces and in innovation isn’t a mission statement. It’s a business model. And it commits us to continual reinvention of IBM itself. Over the past several years, we’ve taken aggressive steps to remix our business so that we are positioned for long-term leadership and new opportunities in the high-value enterprise space, however that changes. We have, since 1997: • exited or reduced our presence in such areas as application software, hard-disk drives, networking hardware, low-end printers and retail PCs—which we estimate have declined from 31 percent to 25 percent of IT industry revenue; • entered or increased our presence in distributed middleware, non-hardware maintenance services, Intel-based servers and mobile PCs—which have grown from 40 percent of industry revenue to 46 percent, and are expected to continue outperforming the overall IT market; • increased our revenue in business and technology consulting services, infrastructure services and infrastructure software—which generate superior long-term revenue growth, profit, cash and return on invested capital—from 48 percent to 64 percent of our total, with expectations of increasing that going forward; • grown aggressively in emerging markets; in China, India, Russia and Brazil we generated revenue of $3 billion last year and saw double-digit growth; • upped our rate of new account growth, giving us a total of 730,000 large, medium and small enterprise clients—with IBM’s small-and-medium business segment alone growing 14 percent to outperform the market in 2003, adding $2.4 billion in revenue; and • incubated successful new high-growth businesses such as life sciences, digital media, application management services, e-business hosting services, Linux and pervasive computing—each of which has already become a $1 billion-plus revenue stream. In the areas we’re targeting within life sciences and digital media alone, third-party analysts see more than $60 billion of market opportunity by 2006. While we do all this, we’re continuing relentlessly to improve execution. By becoming an on demand business ourselves, we’ve made big strides in product cycle time, new product introduction, sales productivity and simplification of our processes. Our inventories are at their lowest level in more than 20 years, and our continuing progress in integrating our supply chain took $7 billion of cost out of the business in 2003, surpassing what we achieved in 2002. Business value, and a company’s values As I mentioned last year, we’ve been spending a great deal of time thinking, debating and determining the fundamentals of this company. It has been important to do so. When IBMers have been crystal clear and united about our strategies and purpose, it’s amazing what we’ve been able to create and accomplish. When we’ve been uncertain, conflicted or hesitant, we’ve squandered opportunities and even made blunders that would have sunk smaller companies. It may not surprise you, then, that last year we examined IBM’s core values for the first time since the company’s founding. In this time of great change, we needed to affirm IBM’s reason for being, what sets the company apart and what should drive our actions as individual IBMers. Importantly, we needed to find a way to engage everyone in the company and get them to speak up on these important issues. Given the realities of a smart, global, independent-minded, 21st-century workforce like ours, I don’t believe something as vital and personal as values could be dictated from the top. So, for 72 hours last summer, we invited all 319,000 IBMers around the world to engage in an open “values jam” on our global intranet. IBMers by the tens of thousands weighed in. They were thoughtful and passionate about the company they want to be a part of. They were also brutally honest. Some of what they wrote was painful to read, because they pointed out all the bureaucratic and dysfunctional things that get in the way of serving clients, working as a team or implementing new ideas. But we were resolute in keeping the dialog free-flowing and candid. And I don’t
think what resulted—broad, enthusiastic, grass-roots consensus—could have been obtained in any other way. In the end, IBMers determined that our actions will be driven by these values: • Dedication to every client’s success • Innovation that matters, for our company and for the world • Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships I must tell you, this process has been very meaningful to me. We are getting back in touch with what IBM has always been about—and always will be about—in a very concrete way. And I feel that I’ve been handed something every CEO craves: a mandate, for exactly the right kinds of transformation, from an entire workforce. Where will this lead? It is a work in progress, and many of the implications remain to be discovered. What I can tell you is that we are rolling up our sleeves to bring IBM’s values to life in our policies, procedures and daily operations. I’ve already touched on a number of things relating to clients and innovation, but our values of trust and personal responsibility are being managed just as seriously—from changes in how we measure and reward performance, to how we equip and support IBMers’ community volunteerism. Our values underpin our relationships with investors, as well. In late February, the board of directors approved sweeping changes in executive compensation. They include innovative programs that ensure investors first receive meaningful returns—a 10 percent increase in the stock price—before IBM’s top 300 executives can realize a penny of profit from their stock option grants. Putting that into perspective, IBM’s market value would have to increase by $17 billion before executives saw any benefit from this year’s option awards. In addition, these executives will be able to acquire market-priced stock options only if they first invest their own money in IBM stock. We believe these programs are unprecedented, certainly in our industry and perhaps in business. Clearly, leading by values is very different from some kinds of leadership demonstrated in the past by business. It is empowering, and I think that’s much healthier. Rather than burden our people with excessive controls, we are trusting them to make decisions and to act based on values—values they themselves shaped. To me, it’s also just common sense. In today’s world, where everyone is so interconnected and interdependent, it is simply essential that we work for each other’s success. If we’re going to solve the biggest, thorniest and most widespread problems in business and society, we have to innovate in ways that truly matter. And we have to do all this by taking personal responsibility for all of our relationships—with clients, colleagues, partners, investors and the public at large. This is IBM’s mission as an enterprise, and a goal toward which we hope to work with many others, in our industry and beyond. Playing offense Put it all together—a more focused business model, an industry shift that plays to our strengths, bets that are paying off in the near term, and a workforce that is united and impatient to become the great company we all aspire to be—and I feel good about IBM and our prospects. Without the prod of fear or of a “burning platform,” we’ve begun a substantial transformation of our company. For the first time in a very long time— probably since my early days with IBM 30 years ago—I’m seeing a company ready to focus more on opportunities than on threats, more intent on setting the agenda than on reacting to the moves of others. Our deep-seated optimism—a fundamental belief that IBMers have always possessed in progress, science and the improvability of the human condition—is reasserting itself. IBMers are ready to reclaim a position of leadership—in our industry and in the larger world of business. Which is a very exciting place to be. For me and my colleagues, it’s just terrific to be part of an energized IBM company that is once again ready to play some offense.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2004,"Dear IBM Investor: Last year, I told you that IBM was in the process of becoming a very different company. I said that we had achieved a new degree of clarity about our business model—innovation for the enterprise— and that this was driving change in every aspect of the corporation. And I described the deeper level of this reexamination—our collective work to redefine IBM’s core values.
Now it’s a year later, and I want to tell you about the progress we have made. IBM today is stronger and more focused than it has been in years. The path we set for ourselves several years ago is yielding results—in terms of an improved competitive position, an enhanced capacity to innovate, and a greater ability to deliver results to our clients and to you, our owners. Our task now comes down to execution. At a recent meeting with IBM’s senior leaders, I said that 2005 is the year of “small s and big E”: less focus on strategic development, maximum push on execution. This is the appropriate emphasis for our company today, because most of the major strategic pieces are now in place for IBM to become the leader of a rapidly changing information technology industry. A good year I want to explain to you what we did last year to turn strategy and vision into results. Your company turned in another good year in 2004. We continued to execute our business plan effectively, producing share gains in key markets, increasing revenue and growing both earnings and earnings per share. Our results from continuing operations saw record revenue of $96.3 billion, an increase of 8 percent; earnings of $8.4 billion, an increase of 11 percent; and diluted earnings per share of $4.94, an increase of 14 percent. One of the strengths of our business model, from a financial point of view, is the amount of cash we generate. After committing $5.7 billion to R&D in 2004, we had $12.9 billion in cash available for investment and distribution to shareholders. Of that, $3.7 billion went for net capital expenditures and $1.7 billion for acquisitions that strengthened our capabilities. We were able to return a record $8.3 billion to investors— $7.1 billion through share repurchase and $1.2 billion through dividends. We ended the year in a strong cash position, with $10.6 billion, including marketable securities. In 2004, our return on invested capital increased to 29 percent , excluding our Global Financing business and a one-time pension settlement charge.*

We were able to achieve these results because of our performance in the marketplace. • IBM Global Services is the leading IT services company in the world, with more than twice the revenue of our nearest rival. We are ranked number one in IT outsourcing, application management and e-business hosting. In 2004, Global Services revenue grew 8 percent to $46.2 billion, driven by continued growth in Strategic Outsourcing, as well as revenue increases in Integrated Technology Services and Business Consulting Services (led by strong growth in Business Transformation Outsourcing). Although signings and backlog declined in 2004, Global Services improved its rate of revenue growth in every quarter, excluding the benefit of currency, due to the improving yield of our backlog and current signings. • Our software revenue totaled $15.1 billion, an increase of 5 percent. We gained share in key segments and held our leading share position in middleware overall. WebSphere grew 14 percent, Rational 15 percent and Tivoli 15 percent. • We continue as number one in the world in servers, with zSeries, pSeries and xSeries each increasing its share position in 2004. IBM is the market leader in the super-hot category of blade servers, with revenue growing more than 150 percent for the year. Industry analyst IDC estimates that by 2008 one of every four servers will be a blade. We had challenging product transitions in storage systems and iSeries, which hurt us. Personal computer revenue growth was strong for the year. Technology OEM growth was good, and we continue to see yield improvements in our semiconductor operation. Overall, our hardware revenue was $31.2 billion, an increase of 10 percent. • Revenue in all of IBM’s industry sectors—which is the way we serve our largest clients globally—grew for the full year, led by the financial services, communications and distribution sectors. We continued our strong growth in sales to small and medium-size businesses, which grew by 8 percent. • We grew and expanded our business in the world’s hypergrowth markets. We have learned over many years that the best way to pursue opportunities in emerging markets is to make investments and build relationships for the long haul, to become part of the local economy and to help advance the society’s broader goals. We are doing that in China, India, Brazil and Russia—and it’s yielding good results. IBM’s business in these four key emerging markets grew more than 25 percent in 2004, to more than $4 billion. The year had its share of challenges, and some parts of the business fell short. But overall, it was a solid year for the IBM company. The results confirm that we are in the right businesses and the right segments of the industry. A transaction and a transformation Of course, just as significant as the segments we are in are those we are not. The industry’s contraction in recent years has forced IT companies to choose between being highvalue innovation players or high-volume distributors of other people’s intellectual capital. Companies that are caught in the middle run the risk of being hammered from both below and above. As I described to you last year, we’ve made our choice: IBM is an innovation company. Of course, declaring something like that is easy. It has taken a great deal of discipline to execute. For instance, over the past several years, while we increased our presence in software, consulting and infrastructure services, we exited or reduced our presence in commoditizing businesses like hard disk drives, memory chips and networking hardware. And most notably, this past December we announced our agreement for Lenovo, China’s computer leader, to acquire IBM’s Personal Computing Division. These kinds of decisions are hard for many companies— indeed, some won’t make them—because it means parting with business models and technologies that were once their crown jewels. In our own case, IBM invented the hard disk drive and DRAM chip, and we set the standard in PCs back in 1981.
We take enormous pride in these achievements. But if you intend to remain the innovation leader, you commit yourself to continuous reinvention. You’ve got to do the hard work, every day, to discover and develop new capabilities — and new ways of working—that will keep you moving forward. The new Lenovo will be the world’s third-largest PC business. It will have greater global reach and greater economies of scale, and we will continue to work together to deliver world-class PC solutions in the marketplace. There’s no doubt in my mind that this was the best path forward for our personal computer business. For IBM, our PC transaction — perhaps the most widely commented-upon event of the year for us—was certainly a milestone. But not, I would argue, for the reasons many believe. We could simply have sold our PC business. Instead, what we did was to reposition both that business and IBM itself in ways that help each and that align with the future trajectory of the IT market. This deal crystallizes, as well as any single event could, the nature of our business model, strategy and marketplace position today: IBM is an enterprise-focused company. It is not our strength or intention to participate directly in consumer markets. We are all about innovation. We are best at creating and delivering differentiating value to our clients. We are a global business. Much more than marketing products and services around the world, this means establishing deep roots locally and leveraging our multinational presence for operational advantage. To explain our perspective on both the IT industry and IBM’s transformation lies beyond the scope of an annual report. However, I do believe it is vital for anyone with an interest in IBM to understand this long-term view and what lies behind it—not a mere cyclical change, but a major structural shift in our industry. That is why we created the document “Understanding Our Company: An IBM Prospectus,” which accompanies this year’s annual report. I encourage you to take a look at it. I think it will help explain how we see the world, and how that is driving our actions. The meaning of 2004 Several major shifts—in business models, in technology and in how they together are reshaping our industry—have driven everything we’ve done at IBM over the past four years. They continued to do so in 2004. 1. Because clients now demand that information technology be intimately integrated with their business operations, we have reshaped IBM’s business skills, assets and delivery capability. This has involved everything from our acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting in 2002, to the launch of multiple industry- and process-specific practices and lines of business. Some people may see this simply as IBM bulking up in services. It is true that we needed to add a lot of deep business expertise—and we will continue to strengthen our hand here. But clients want more than the consultant’s strategic advice, the systems integrator’s skills or the IT outsourcer’s scale. They want new business designs, enabled by technology, that give them some quantifiable competitive advantage. They want new options and alternatives, not only in how they manage IT, but in how they conceptualize and manage their companies. This is what we mean by On Demand Business. CEOs might not use that exact term (yet), but a more responsive, virtually integrated company is increasingly what they are asking us to help them build. Companies like eBay, Bank of America and METRO Group, and institutions like MiamiDade County and the new Museum of Modern Art are, to one degree or another, on demand enterprises. I want to highlight one aspect of On Demand Business, because it represents a very large new market opportunity for us. We call it Business Performance Transformation Services
(BPTS), and industry analyst IDC sizes it at about $1.4 trillion— as large as the existing global IT industry. We peg the part of BPTS that IBM is addressing at about $500 billion. As its name suggests, BPTS involves helping clients optimize their operations through new business designs and processes, and, in some cases, turning over those operations to expert partners to manage. As you can imagine, this is a very different type of services business—one that is increasingly “asset-based.” It requires deep knowledge of business processes like logistics, supply chain and human resource management, and relies heavily on automated processes and intellectual capital, not mere labor arbitrage. In 2004, we extended our capabilities in BPTS, making substantial investments in four areas—Business Transformation Outsourcing, Engineering and Technology Services, Strategy and Change Consulting, and Business Performance Management Software. We generated more than $3 billion in revenue in these four areas—up about 45 percent over the previous year. And our software and services groups are working together to build out an infrastructure that fuses business transformation with information technology—what is called services-oriented architecture—to support our evolution to an asset-based services business. 2. Because we saw that computing was undergoing a fundamental shift, we developed the architecture and technologies for the On Demand Operating Environment, based on open standards. The new computing architecture is based on a truly networked world and the emergence of open standards—for the first time in our industry’s history—as well as some exciting new technologies and new ways of accessing and managing IT. It builds on our strengths in enterprise computing, core technology and software. One of our most important core technologies is our Power microprocessor family. What’s significant about Power is not just that it’s fast and packs a lot of punch (plenty of microprocessors do). Power is highly customizable.
Consider: 32,768 Power processors are at the heart of our Blue Gene supercomputer, which last year set a new record— more than 70 trillion calculations per second. Yet variations of Power chips are also the foundation for our pSeries and iSeries, and are used in our blade servers, our storage systems and an expanding array of devices—network routers, mobile devices, game consoles—designed by our OEM partners. Built on a Power core, the Cell processor—a “supercomputer on a chip”—was developed along with Sony and Toshiba for broadband, high-definition uses. Increasing the uses of the Power family is important for IBM, because it gives us the advantages of a high-performance processor and high-volume economics. This is one reason we’ve opened Power’s technical specifications through our Power Everywhere and Power.org initiatives. We are building a broader ecosystem of innovation around Power, reflecting the fact that innovation today is an increasingly collaborative process—and not only in software. And speaking of software, through steady internal development and select acquisitions over the past several years, IBM has become the leader in enterprise-class middleware, which helps companies integrate and manage their operations. An important differentiator for our software business is that it is entirely built on open standards, supporting a wide variety of hardware platforms and applications. This gives our clients flexibility and choice, and makes it easy for them to integrate their infrastructure and business operations. 3. These two elements of on demand — new business models and a new computing infrastructure — are now coming together in ways that will redefine the industry and play to IBM’s strengths. All of these changes—businesses we’ve exited, those we’ve entered, our increased investments, the technologies and practices we’ve invented—were undertaken not simply to assemble a portfolio, even a portfolio of high-value businesses, but to do something with them. Namely, we aim to give our clients capabilities they cannot get either from another company or even a collection of other companies. This is why we’ve worked hard to forge connections between our services and software businesses, our semiconductor unit and our server and storage units, between IBM Research and every other part of the company, and between IBM and an increasing variety of business partners. IBM’s strategy is less about going to market with a more complete array of capabilities than it is about leveraging those capabilities to create new intellectual capital for clients. Priorities going forward As we move ahead in 2005, we are guided by the same priorities that have shaped our progress thus far. we will make on demand business a fuller reality for clients. The concept is no longer in dispute. Enterprises are achieving tangible benefits from being on demand—and are increasingly embracing its long-term strategic promise for competitive advantage. We will work with a growing roster of clients who want to become on demand enterprises, and we will continue to build out the technologies and services for the On Demand Operating Environment. we will continue to deepen ibm’s capabilities as a company built on innovation. This is our business model and has been since the company’s inception. It has shaped our transformation over the past several years, and it continues to shape the evolution of our workforce strategy, management systems, economics and client relationships.
we will focus in 2005 on execution. This is that “big E” message I gave to IBM’s leaders at the beginning of this year. All of our strategic work over the past four years has given us considerable capabilities to seize the growth and profit opportunities I’ve described. Now, we have to improve our ability to integrate all of this capability for our clients. In other words, we need to become even more of an On Demand Business ourselves. And a big part of that is what I call “lowering the center of gravity” of our company. For us, this is neither conventional decentralization nor simple delegation. It means shifting resources closer to the point of contact with the client, creating enterprise-wide processes that are commonly shared, and establishing truly global operations that capitalize on the talent and scale now available in every part of the world. Every time we have simplified the company and pushed authority and resources closer to where the day-to-day action is, we’ve seen great results—with clients (because we are easier to do business with), in our cost structure (because we eliminate unnecessary layers), in revenue growth (because we differentiate ourselves from the competition) and in how individual IBMers feel about their company. Last year, I told you about the online “jam” in which IBMers collectively defined our values for the first time in nearly a century. I told you what an outpouring of passion, imagination and pride that was. Well, even more impressive was the follow-up jam we held last fall. This time, we asked IBMers to contribute ideas to make our values a day-to-day reality in the company. Participation was extraordinary — more than 57,000 IBMers contributed more than 32,000 comments and ideas— and the ideas were concrete, practical and focused on execution. The top-rated ideas range from back-office integration supporting the development and marketing of integrated solutions; to helping first-line managers by giving them more authority over budgets and freeing up their time to devote to their people; to clearing away the barriers that inhibit us from collaborating, innovating and contributing to IBM’s growth. These and dozens of other ideas are now in various stages of implementation, and I am confident that they will make a material difference to IBM. Our values are also being turned into actions every day in countless other ways: how we work with our clients and colleagues; the actions of IBM’s crisis response team after the Asian tsunami disaster; or the progress of the World Community Grid — harnessing vast, unused computational power to help cure disease and forecast natural disasters. From the point of view of a CEO, perhaps the best aspect of this entire process has been the broad platform it creates to drive change. When your primary organizational challenge is one of execution, there is nothing more encouraging than the knowledge that your organization’s direction and sense of mission come not out of some threat or crisis, but from the aspirations of your own workforce. For 329,000 IBMers—and you can count me among them—what drives us every day is a determination to make IBM the great company we all want and expect it to be.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2005,"Dear IBM Investor, In my letters to you over the past several years, I have described IBM’s view of how the information technology industry is being radically reshaped by developments in technology, its application in business and the onrush of globalization. I have also reported on the actions we have taken to capitalize on these shifts and to position our company for long-term prosperity. _1 AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, IBM has emerged from this period a very different company. We are much more focused on the high-value segments of our industry, better balanced, more productive and more profitable than just a few years ago. Our solid results in 2005 are a consequence of this repositioning, and of the innovation and marketplace execution of more than 329,000 IBMers around the world. Our revenue in 2005 was $88.3 billion, up 3 percent, without our divested personal computer business. Revenue as reported was $91.1 billion, down 5 percent. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations were $12.2 billion, an increase of 15 percent; and diluted earnings per share were $4.91, up 12 percent. Excluding non-recurring items, our earnings per share increased 18 percent, to $5.32. Particularly noteworthy was a rise of 3.2 points in IBM’s gross profit margin, to 40.1 percent. After investing $5.8 billion in R&D, $3.5 billion in net capital expenditures and $1.5 billion for acquisitions, we ended the year with $13.7 billion of cash, including marketable securities. Over the past several years, IBM has consistently generated return on invested capital significantly above the average for the S&P 500, and we did so again in 2005, with ROIC of 24 percent, excluding Global Financing and nonrecurring items. We were able to return a record of nearly $9 billion to you — $7.7 billion through share repurchase and $1.2 billion through dividends. After lots of hard work to remix our portfolio of businesses and to improve IBM’s overall competitiveness, I believe the headwinds we faced entering the decade are largely behind us. In this letter, I will describe the performance of IBM’s three major businesses. I will also describe why I believe that our business model, based on the twin pillars of integration and innovation, and underpinned by a strong financial footing, is unique— and why we are strongly positioned to capture the most attractive growth and profit opportunities in the years ahead. Leadership Businesses and Leadership Results Our results in 2005 were achieved through the marketplace performance of our major businesses — Systems and Technology, Software, and Services. Let me describe that performance briefly for each. SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY: Our company’s technology strength is the result of long-term investments we’ve made over many years, investments that are now bearing fruit. Last year, IBM’s Systems and Technology business extended its industry leadership, enhancing its competitive standing and staking out advantageous positions in growth markets of the future. Since 2000, IBM’s total share of the server market has grown 9.5 points in annual revenue, according to industry analyst IDC. Our Systems and Technology revenues in 2005 were up 5 percent. In the fourth quarter, shipments of MIPS (millions of instructions per second) for our zSeries mainframes grew 28 percent yearto-year — our largest quarter of MIPS shipments on record, leading to our highest mainframe revenue since the fourth quarter of 1998. pSeries UNIX servers had a strong year, growing 15 percent, with double-digit growth in all geographies. We believe this was the fourth straight year of improvement in pSeries’ market position. We expect to maintain our leadership in the fast-growing Blade server business, with a 2005 growth rate of 65 percent. In addition, our system storage business was up 15 percent for the year, driven by our mainstay disk and tape products. And our emerging technologies also gained momentum, such as storage virtualization, which added 1,700 clients. Led by our sweep of the three major gaming platforms, IBM’s microelectronics business achieved 16 percent growth. Revenue from our 300-millimeter wafer products grew strongly in 2005— including more than 250 percent growth in the fourth quarter. Engineering & Technology Services grew 39 percent for the year. The Cell Broadband Engine, our revolutionary microprocessor developed through a unique technology collaboration with Sony and Toshiba, is bringing the capabilities of supercomputerlevel simulation to multiple arenas, including consumer electronics, healthcare and defense. Recently we combined a number of these engineering and technology operations into a new unit, Technology Collaboration Solutions, to bring greater focus and resources to the opportunities we see in collaborative innovation. There is large and growing demand across engineering-intensive industries — from automotive and aerospace to telecommunications and medical equipment — to leverage the technologies and research prowess of partners. This is not outsourced R&D, but true shoulder-to-shoulder collaboration. The ability to extend IBM’s legendary technology strengths to clients to accelerate their own product and service R&D is a powerful proposition that no one in our industry can easily match. SOFTWARE: Software revenues totaled $15.8 billion in 2005, an increase of 4 percent. We believe we improved our competitive position in all five of our key middleware brands. Indeed, 2005 marked a milestone for our software business. As I’ve reported to you for several years, we have been focusing our internal software R&D and acquisition efforts on the high-growth middleware segment of the software opportunity. Last year, for the first time, more than half of our software revenue came from strategic middleware products vs. the slower growth host or legacy platforms. In software, as in systems, the technology bets we made several years ago are paying off. Companies are seeking to dissolve barriers that impede the flow of information within the enterprise by deploying open, standards-based middleware to integrate their IT systems and to maximize digital assets in all their forms. There is a significant shift underway in the world of software toward what is called service-oriented architecture (SOA), which allows companies to be much more flexible and responsive. As the worldwide leader in middleware, IBM is in a strong position to capitalize on the SOA market, which some analysts expect to more than double, to $143 billion, by 2008. Our WebSphere middleware family grew 10 percent in 2005, with particular strength in Application Servers and Portals, which grew 15 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Information management software grew 8 percent, fueled by our content management and information integration products— a set of offerings that we are enhancing with a $1 billion investment in a new “information on demand” practice we announced this February, including advanced tools and 10,000 additional practitioners located in centers of excellence around the world. Our Rational software tools grew 4 percent for the year, and Tivoli 11 percent— including 24 percent growth for Tivoli storage software, as clients continued their strong adoption of our virtualization technologies. In addition, our 2005 acquisitions of companies such as Ascential, Bowstreet, SRD and DWL have strengthened our hand in other high-growth areas, including business integration and Web-enabled software. GLOBAL SERVICES: IBM Global Services remains the leading IT services company in the world, with more than twice the revenue of our nearest rival. We are ranked as the number-one service provider in IT outsourcing, Web hosting and consulting & systems integration. Revenues from Global Services in 2005 totaled $47.4 billion, an increase of 2 percent. Our backlog is estimated at $111 billion, the same as a year ago. We’ve been seeing a transition in services over the past few years, a shift to smaller deals of shorter duration. These are good opportunities — if you can recalibrate your sales model to capture them in addition to the traditional “mega-deals.” And the profitability of these kinds of deals is very attractive, if your global cost structure is competitive. We had to address both our sales model and services cost structure last year, and we did so. We also took other actions to strengthen our services business — shifting thousands of employees into global delivery centers; rebalancing our Integrated Technology Services portfolio; and doubling the resources dedicated to integrated solutions, which we expect will account for 70 percent of the total IT opportunity by 2008. These changes give us a platform for increasing growth in 2006. I want to call out in particular our continuing progress in the high-growth market we call Business Performance Transformation Services. This is where we apply our technology prowess and economies of scale to running and transforming business processes for our clients — from supply chain, to human resources, to logistics and more. Our BPTS revenue increased 28 percent in 2005, to $4 billion. We have more than tripled our resources focused on BPTS since early 2004. Several of our 16 acquisitions in 2005 were aimed at strengthening our BPTS capabilities in such areas as healthcare, the orderto-cash cycle and “applications on demand” for small and medium businesses. We’re increasing investments in engineering collaboration. And we recently created a new unit to consolidate and accelerate our efforts in business transformation outsourcing, including a promising opportunity to deliver more standardized business processing services, mainly to smaller enterprises. Integrate to Innovate Each of our three major businesses is a multi-faceted leader in its own right. But they are not standalone entities. They work together in a model defined by integration and innovation — the imperatives that we believe are increasingly shaping business and society in the 21st century. This ability to integrate and innovate is unique to IBM, and sets us apart from our competition. • Innovation is increasingly what businesses and institutions of all kinds seek, in response to a “flattening” world of ever-more intense and global competition. That sounds simple enough— but it’s not just about building a “better mousetrap.” The kind of innovation companies need today goes beyond products or services, involving all aspects of the enterprise— from business processes and models to management systems, culture and policies. Accomplishing this kind of systemic innovation requires a unique blend of business and technology, and a deep understanding of the new tools, techniques and capabilities that have come of age today. • Integration of technology with business design is now possible as never before — and therefore is necessary as never before, for companies that hope to remain competitive. After decades of new technology invention, we are entering a phase familiar to economic historians who study technological revolutions. This is when new technologies get infused into every aspect of business and society. And this is when lasting value is created and real money gets made. Increasingly today, it’s playing out on a global stage — and that, in turn, is driving a new model of the corporation itself. We’re shifting away from the 20th century multinational and toward a new way to integrate the components of business activity on a global basis. We call this the “globally integrated enterprise.” Those who succeed in this new era will seize upon innovation and integration to differentiate themselves from their rivals — including the new ones that will arise continually from all corners of an increasingly interconnected planet. We’ve been talking for several years about the bifurcation of our industry and the fundamental choice that companies in IT have to make between two radically different business models. One of those is to compete on low price in rapidly commoditizing segments. These types of businesses focus on revenue growth, but their models, based on commodity products and services, inherently do not produce superior profit margins. The other is to compete by creating unique, differentiating value through innovation. As you know, we have chosen to be the provider of high-value, innovative solutions. But candidly, we were not well positioned to be a high-value leader as recently as a few years ago. We were weighed down by commoditizing business lines with eroding profit margins. Today, we have succeeded in moving almost entirely out of commoditizing areas. In addition, we have shifted our transaction mix more toward higher value solutions and away from individual product sales. In large measure as a result of those changes, our gross profit margin is the best it’s been since 1996, and the company is much better balanced in terms of profit contribution. When you exclude second-quarter restructuring charges and PCs, about 37 percent of our profit last year was from software, including enterprise investments; about 28 percent from systems and financing; and about 35 percent from services. An Innovation Company If you understand the broad economic and societal changes taking place, the transformation of our company to capitalize on them and the resulting mix of our business, it should be apparent that IBM in 2006 is neither a “computer company” nor a “services company.” We are not even “an IT company.” IBM today, perhaps more than any time in our history, is an innovation company. We have a distinctive point of view on how innovation is changing, and a unique set of capabilities to enable our clients to capture its benefits. In a word, we are their innovation partner. We make them innovative — the innovators’ innovator, if you will. You’d never see this, though, if you only looked through the lens of the IT industry’s traditional segmentation: hardware, software, services and their many product-specific subsets. Further, that view doesn’t just obscure the picture of IBM; it also distorts the reality of how technology is acquired and used by businesses today. Companies, governmental agencies, educational and healthcare organizations and other enterprises and institutions everywhere are faced with opportunities and threats, and in response they need to innovate. That’s the industry we are part of, and those are the marketplace realities everyone in it needs to address. For IBMers, this deeper notion of innovation is what we mean when we talk about “innovation that matters”— one of three core values we collectively defined for our company three years ago in one of our all-company jams. IBMers around the world are tremendously excited about the possibilities being unlocked by this broad and ambitious notion of innovation. And we’re eager to share our point of view with clients, partners and our thousands of collaborators across business, government, education and every area of society. 
To that end, we have prepared a companion document to this annual report, describing some of the powerful tools, techniques and new models that are available and affordable for innovators today. It’s a Great Time To Be an Innovator also contains the stories of IBM clients who are using these new capabilities to enhance their own unique strengths and thus achieve differentiation and competitive advantage. I think you’ll find it informative, and I hope it stimulates ideas about how your own organization or community could benefit from the new possibilities for innovation. An Integrated Company For IBM, the key to capturing all this value we’re creating through innovation is to integrate it for our clients. Operationally, that raises two key questions: Where is it best for that integration to occur, and around what? I believe the right place to integrate IBM is close to the action — which is why we’ve been working hard to “lower the center of gravity” of our company. Starting in Europe, for instance, we implemented a new management system in 2005 that flattened the organizational structure and moved more clientfacing leaders out into local markets — the biggest such change there in nearly half a century. It used to be that 44 percent of executives were in headquarters offices; now, 84 percent of them are working in-country. In addition, we have tripled the number of people working in or serving emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia — where together our business grew 23 percent last year, excluding PCs. At the same time, we have shifted pricing authority down to the country level. We also created “deal hubs” to give our teams a single point of contact for sales support and other client services. They’ve been an immediate success. Win rates are up across the board — with double-digit increases in the countries of Europe where we piloted the hubs. We will roll out new deal hubs in the Americas, Asia, Australia and additional parts of Europe in the first half of this year. 
When it comes to the second question — on what basis are we integrating? — the answer lies in our core values. For the IBMers who shaped these values, they are much more than vague aspirations. They are, in fact, a set of decision-making criteria that guide how we organize and run the company. A little more than a year ago, tens of thousands of IBMers came together to turn our values into dozens of specific actions and changes — many of which we implemented in 2005. I’ve described some of them, such as the deal hubs, in this letter. These steps to transform our company were crucial, and that work will never stop. But being a values-managed company applies at the top, as well. That’s why, at the beginning of this year, I decided to disband the senior leadership structure that had been in place in IBM for more than a decade, and to replace it with one based on simpler, clearer criteria for our top positions. First, we formed a new group of IBM’s seniormost leaders who will be accountable for the performance and execution of our business. Second, we created a broader group that will focus specifically on integrating IBM on the basis of our values. Both groups met for the first time about a month ago to discuss how to bring to bear all of IBM’s capability to drive marketplace results. I know from the team’s energy and commitment that this move was the right thing to do. Innovation that Matters These days, you’d have to look long and hard to find a company that doesn’t say it is committed to innovation. But innovation of the sort I’ve discussed here — the kind that’s grounded in the integration of business and technology, that draws on multi-faceted collaboration and that functions in a truly global way — is devilishly hard. For all the reasons I’ve shared with you in this letter, I believe that IBM has an unmatched ability to deliver this sort of innovation. We are the only company that couples broad expertise across industries and business processes with deep technology capability. We have a unique understanding of information technology’s potential and future trajectory, because we’re at the forefront of creating both. We are rapidly becoming a model of global integration — leveraging economies of scale and expertise for the benefit of our clients and our own operational effectiveness. And while many companies consult or offer piece-part technologies and services, we are distinct in our ability to integrate the right technologies, expertise and partnerships in ways that enable our clients to be truly special. “Innovation that matters” is, finally, central to IBM’s identity — to why our employees choose us; why our partners and clients look to collaborate with us; and why you, our owners, invest in us. And interestingly, this same vision is showing up more and more these days among companies, governments, educators, healthcare practitioners and communities around the world. For IBM, this is gratifying, and hopeful. As we enter a promising new era, I am proud of the worldwide IBM team for bringing us to this point — and I am grateful to you, our shareholders, for your support as we have repositioned the company to be the innovation leader. I and my colleagues are delighted and challenged by the prospect of advancing this work, and by what, together with our clients, our partners and you, we can do to lead it.



"
IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2006,"Dear IBM Investor: I am happy to report to you on a very strong year for our company. In my letter last year, I said that we believed we had positioned ourselves to capture the most attractive growth and profit opportunities in our industry. In 2006 we did just that, setting new records in profit, earnings per share and cash performance. What our numbers do not reveal—and what is perhaps IBM’s most notable accomplishment during this period—is that we achieved these results while fundamentally reshaping our company. Whether you look at our technology, strategy, business model, processes or culture, IBM is a very different enterprise today than it was at the beginning of the decade. We have prepared the company for growth and leadership in a radically different future—while continuing to deliver steady results.
IBM had a strong year in 2006. Revenue as reported was $91.4 billion, up 4 percent, excluding PCs from our 2005 results. Pretax earnings from continuing operations were $13.3 billion, an increase of 9 percent. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $6.06, up 23 percent, marking 16 straight quarters of growth. IBM has consistently generated return on invested capital significantly above the average for the S&P 500 over the past several years, and we did so again in 2006, with ROIC of 34 percent, excluding our Global Financing business.
IBM’s gross profit margin rose for the third consecutive year—to 41.9 percent, an increase of 1.8 points in 2006, up more than five points since 2003. Our pretax income margin rose to 14.6 percent, an increase of 1.2 points. Both margins are at their highest in the past 10 years. Significantly, as I will discuss, they were achieved primarily by remixing our business to higher-value segments and by driving efficiency through global integration. In many respects, IBM is a “higher-torque” engine today. With revenue growth that matches our segments of the industry, we have been able to generate strong profit and cash. In 2006 we generated net cash from operations, excluding a year-to-year change in Global Financing receivables, of $15.3 billion—an increase of $2.2 billion from last year and our highest on record. In addition, net cash generated from every dollar of revenue has increased 18 percent since 2003. IBM ended 2006 with $10.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. And of course, stronger earnings and cash give us more flexibility to increase returns to you and to invest in future sources of growth. Our net 2006 cash investment of $3.8 billion for 13 acquisitions—nine of them in key strategic areas of software— was up $2.3 billion year to year. After investing $6.1 billion in R&D and $4.7 billion in net capital expenditures, we were able to return a record of nearly $9.8 billion to you—$8.1 billion through share repurchase and $1.7 billion through dividends—or more than 100 percent of our net earnings. In April 2006 we announced a 50-percent increase in our quarterly dividend, the largest percentage increase in IBM history and the 362nd consecutive dividend paid by IBM. This was the 11th year in a row in which we have increased our dividend. Our balance sheet remains strong, and the company is well positioned to take advantage of new strategic opportunities.
Strategic Choices In order to understand how we achieved these results, I think it is helpful to look back to the major strategic choices we made several years ago. They were by no means obvious at the time, and most IT companies chose different paths. But as we entered the new century, we were convinced that three developments would be of paramount importance to IBM and our clients: 1. We believed that our clients would place a premium on innovation. What technology company doesn’t say it’s all about innovation? But if you really take this seriously, then you have to commit your company to continuous adaptation and change. Such is the nature of our industry, and many IT companies learn that lesson the hard way. Today, it’s clear that computing is radically changing—from the data center and the network to the proliferation of technology into the home, appliances, vehicles and the infrastructure of the planet. And it’s equally clear that businesses and institutions worldwide now look to innovation as their key to competitive differentiation and growth. To capture the most valuable opportunities, we’ve had to change our mix of products, services, skills and technologies. This is why we’ve exited businesses like PCs and hard disk drives, and why, through a combination of internal R&D shifts and acquisitions, we have substantially strengthened our position in emerging, higher-value spaces, such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), information on demand, business process services and open, modular systems for businesses of all sizes. 2. We believed that both our industry and our clients would seek to reintegrate. But it would not be integration as in the past—product bundling, “turnkey” solutions or consolidation of industry segments. Instead, businesses would increasingly seek to integrate advanced technology with their business processes and operations, even their core business model. Why? Because this kind of integration would make them both more productive and more innovative. It would give them differentiation and competitive advantages they could not get from off-the-shelf technology and solutions. Conceptually, this is an ideal role for IBM to play—the “innovators’ innovator.” But since this kind of integration requires intimate knowledge of each client, it cannot be done in the lab or on the plant floor, and it certainly can’t be done in headquarters. It has meant an ongoing effort to change our processes and structures to push decision making close to the marketplace—what we internally call “lowering the center of gravity” of IBM. 3. We believed that globalization would fundamentally change business. Because of free trade policies, the Internet and the emergence of highly skilled populations, we believed that globalization would arrive in full force— and with it the reality that anyone could capitalize on expertise and market conditions everywhere in the world. We believed this opportunity would soon become an economic imperative: Businesses, institutions, industries and societies would need to adapt to the changing environment. One important aspect of this was a change in the form of the corporation itself. The “multinational” of the 20th century was evolving into a new kind of institution, the globally integrated enterprise — which locates its operations and functions anywhere in the world based on the right cost, the right skills and the right business environment. We committed ourselves to becoming a model of this new form, and we have begun transforming IBM’s operations accordingly, tapping into skills and expertise available all over the world and integrating our operations globally. We have also begun a promising dialogue with our clients and with government, business and academic leaders around the world to explore the potential of global integration for economic and societal progress. As a result of these strategic choices and actions, IBM’s business model today is not only more aligned with our clients’ needs, but is also a stronger engine of financial performance. That was evident in 2006. Our innovation-driven strategy and financial model are also putting us in a favorable position relative to our competitors within each area of our business mix. Business Mix and Results Some of IBM’s competitors—those who are not as focused, do not have the financial capacity to invest, or are trying to straddle commodity and higher-value businesses— are struggling to deal with the changes underway today. As we have learned, it’s better to be in businesses that are truly differentiating in the eyes of the client than to go simply for size, volume and thin margins—where the client doesn’t receive unique value, and the investor doesn’t benefit. This is why we have entered new, more attractive spaces, through acquisition and by redirecting our R&D investments. Let me describe how these shifts are impacting each of our major businesses. • Software: In the world of software, we are witnessing a shift toward new architectures and the componentization of applications. This new model, inherently networked and based upon open standards, enables different business designs and the horizontal integration of business processes. Within the enterprise, its main impact is occurring at the level of middleware. Because we began years ago to build a position as the worldwide leader in middleware, IBM is now uniquely able to capitalize on it. IBM’s software segment revenues totaled $18.2 billion in 2006, an increase of 8 percent. Software generated 40 percent of IBM’s segment pretax profits. We are recognized as the industry leader in SOA. The information on demand practice we launched in 2006, grouped under Information Management, grew 68 percent. Our acquisition of companies such as FileNet, MRO and Micromuse enhanced our growth in information and systems management. Our industry-leading WebSphere family grew 23 percent for the year, with particular strength in application servers and business integration. Rational software tools grew 4 percent, and Tivoli 26 percent. Our Lotus division— which introduced well-received Web 2.0-enabled collaboration tools for the enterprise in early 2007—grew 12 percent. We will be expanding our software offerings in 2007 to move beyond one-on-one and team collaboration—introducing tools that build communities of expertise. • Global Services: The global services industry is being reshaped by two trends. The first is the emergence of a new services model, based on the integration of software and services, and the breaking-up of formerly monolithic business processes into components that can be delivered over the Web. IBM Global Services is leading the industry in the development of business componentization and the technology enablement of business processes. The second trend is a shift to smaller deals of shorter duration, higher profitability and more industry-specific focus. While our transition to this model experienced some hiccups initially, we are making steady progress and saw solid growth in short-term signings in 2006. IBM remains the leading IT services company in the world, with more than twice the revenue of our nearest rival. Revenues from our two Global Services segments in 2006 totaled $48.3 billion, an increase of 2 percent. Services’ share of IBM’s segment pretax profits increased to 37 percent. Revenues from the Global Technology 
Services segment totaled $32.3 billion, an increase of 3 percent. Revenues from the Global Business Services segment were essentially flat at $16 billion, but improvements in utilization, pricing, contract management and delivery optimization enabled it to grow its pretax margin by 2.7 points, to 9.8 percent, excluding 2005 special actions. IBM Global Services is ranked as the number one or number two service provider in consulting, systems integration, maintenance, Web hosting, application services and data center outsourcing. With a strong finish to the year—the fourth quarter, with nearly $18 billion in signings, was our largest since the second quarter of 2002—we ended 2006 with an estimated backlog of $116 billion. • Systems and Technology: IBM is the world leader in servers, and is leading a number of key changes in the industry, including shifts to multicore microprocessors, to high-end virtualized systems, and to the new category of modular systems known as blades. In 2006 we rolled out systems based on the new generation of our Power Architecture family, POWER5+; introduced the System z Business Class mainframe, targeting smaller firms; and extended our virtualization and energy management capabilities. Our systems and technology business extended its industry leadership in 2006, with segment revenues of $22 billion, an increase of 5 percent. Global Financing segment revenues totaled $2.4 billion, a decrease of 2 percent. Our System z mainframes had a strong year, growing 8 percent and marking their sixth consecutive quarter of increased shipments of MIPS (millions of instructions per second). Our system storage business was up 6 percent for the year, and our microelectronics business continued to grow, increasing 22 percent for the year, thanks to our position as the technology engine for all three major gaming platforms. Systems and Technology Group and Global Financing accounted for 23 percent of IBM’s segment pretax profit in 2006. The hard work we’ve done to remix our businesses to lead in these emergent, higher-profit spaces is now showing up in our earnings and gross profit margins. But a changed business mix is not the only factor causing IBM’s strong performance.
Innovation and Global Integration IBM’s lines of business work together in a model defined by innovation and global integration, the twin imperatives that we believe are reshaping business and society in the 21st century. This ability to both innovate and integrate— and do so in ways that are truly global—is unique to IBM, and sets us apart from our competition. Last year was in many ways the culmination of our repositioning of IBM as an innovation company. Its most visible manifestation was our marketing and communications campaign around the theme, “What makes you special?” Of course, marketing campaigns by themselves are of little importance—unless they persuade the world of an underlying reality that is substantial and meaningful. Ours did, supported by a long list of clients whose innovation potential we have unleashed through unique solutions. It was also supported by the continued preeminence of IBM’s research and development capabilities, reflected in our 14th straight year of earning by far the most U.S. patents of any company in the world. Our ability to deliver differentiating innovation to our clients is being greatly enhanced by IBM’s global integration— which is simultaneously giving us better economics and deeper capabilities, while eliminating enormous redundancies that were built up over 50 years as a multinational. IBM operates in 170 countries, with about 65 percent of our employees outside the U.S., including 30 percent in Asia Pacific. Our non-U.S. operations generate about 60 percent of IBM’s revenue. IBM’s research and software development have long been globally integrated. The company’s R&D system assigns work among our 20,000-plus software developers in 61 labs in 15 countries, and 3,000 scientists and technologists in IBM Research centers in the U.S., China, Israel, Switzerland, Japan and India, based on areas of unique expertise. In 2006 we expanded our global delivery centers, where talented IBMers support the full range of our clients’ applications and business transformation initiatives. We added thousands of skilled people and improved our capabilities in India, Brazil and Argentina, as well as Eastern Europe and multiple other locations in Asia. We have moved our global procurement mission to China and many of the services that support our external and internal Websites to places like Brazil and Ireland. Our financing back office is in Rio de Janeiro. These IBMers are not leading teams focused on China or India or Brazil or Ireland. They are leading integrated global operations. In addition to integrating the entire company globally, we are investing to extend our leadership within the fastest-growing markets. We have tripled the number of people working in or serving markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia in the past four years. Our business there, excluding PCs, grew 21 percent last year. Over the next four years, we expect these markets to grow at more than two times the worldwide rate, with an opportunity of more than $150 billion by 2010. In the May/June 2006 issue of the public policy journal Foreign Affairs, I described our point of view on the globally integrated enterprise, and this idea has struck a chord with many leaders around the world. We are now working actively across IBM’s broad ecosystem to explore the promise—and challenges—of this new model. We believe it offers hope for a new kind of globalization, one that not only generates vast new opportunity, but that also vastly expands the chances for all people on the planet to share in it. A Distinctive Way of Thinking To many of us, IBM’s transformation of the past few years, while dramatic, has not felt unfamiliar. For me and others in my generation, the experience has not been one of entering uncharted waters, but of returning to a pace of change, a level of impact and a type of thinking that drew us to this company in the first place. And its origins go back a long way. For nearly a century, businesses, institutions and individuals have sought a relationship with IBM because of this company’s unique ability to conceptualize opportunities, to analyze developments and to reimagine how the world could work. For nearly a century, literally millions of women and men have been drawn here to be part of an enterprise that above all grounded itself in lasting values, and that valued, above all, the capacity of its people to think. Today, those values and that kind of thinking are deepening and taking on more and more exciting new forms. One example in 2006 was InnovationJam—an open brainstorming event on IBM’s worldwide intranet that engaged more than 150,000 IBMers, their family members, IBM clients and partners from business and academia. We shared a few of our “crown jewels,” some of the latest technologies from IBM’s labs. Then, together, we explored how these new capabilities might be applied to urgent needs— from the environment, to healthcare, to small global business, to the emergence of a “3-D Internet”— and how those possibilities might spawn new high-growth businesses. We have assigned senior business owners to develop 10 of the most promising ideas, and we’ve stripped away process so they can move quickly. We also gave them a pool of $100 million in development funds to get them started. The important point in this is that when you commit yourself to innovation that matters, you free up talented people to try new things—new approaches, new partnerships, new markets. That is, you ask them to think. To capture some of the essential elements of IBM’s way of working, collaborating and approaching problems, we have created a companion piece for this year’s annual report. It is entitled, appropriately enough, Think. For all IBM investors— and for anyone who is considering a relationship with our company, either as a client, a partner, an employee, or a neighbor—an understanding of what makes IBM tick is essential in gauging our prospects for the century ahead. As we enter this new era of technology, business and global society, I am proud of the worldwide IBM team for bringing us to this point, and I am grateful to you, our shareholders, for your support in our journey. I hope and trust that you are pleased with how your company is growing and evolving. My colleagues and I are excited by the possibilities for how, together with our clients, our partners and you, we can bring this remarkable enterprise into its next phase of leadership and discovery.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2007,"Dear IBM Investor: I am very pleased to report to you on a superb year for your company—a year of record revenue, profit, cash flow and earnings per share. It reflects the hard work of some of the world’s brightest and most innovative women and men—the IBMers I’m proud to call my colleagues. It is also the result of important strategic choices we made several years ago—choices that have put IBM in a strong position to continue to grow profitably, to strengthen our client relationships, and to seize the most attractive opportunities in a very dynamic global economy. 
IBM is a different company today. To understand why, let me briefly describe how we got to our present position. At the beginning of the decade, all of us in the information technology industry—indeed, in all of business—were confronted with fundamental changes: the reality of global integration, a new computing model and new ways for businesses and institutions to apply technology to create value. It was clear that we had to change—and not only to capture future opportunities. The fact is, if we had stayed still, the company’s competitiveness would have been at risk. So we made important decisions, and got to work. Global integration: As the decade began, we observed the accelerating integration of global economies, and with it the emergence of two important—I would say historic—opportunities. We had a chance to capture rapid growth in dozens of countries as they invested heavily in information technology to modernize their societies. And we could also tap into enormous populations of skills all over the world. We set out to seize both opportunities. We’ve made major investments in emerging markets, building up our teams in nations all over the world. At the same time, we have
been globally integrating IBM’s operations rapidly, locating our work and functions wherever it makes the most sense, based on the right cost, the right skills and the right business environment. Today we have a truly global supply chain; we develop software globally; our network of research laboratories is worldwide; and we deliver services on an unmatched global scale. We are continuing to transform our processes and functions to move IBM to this profoundly new model of the corporation, which we call the Globally Integrated Enterprise. 
Technology: IBM has been saying it for many years: The basic computing model has changed. The PC model of the 1980s has receded in importance to clients, and has been replaced by a new paradigm, based on openness, networks, powerful new technology and the integration of digital intelligence into the fabric of work and life. As you know, we have dramatically changed our mix of products, services, skills and technologies. We exited businesses like PCs and hard disk drives—businesses that we had invented. We shifted our internal R&D and have made more than 60 acquisitions over the past five years. At the time, many were skeptical—but one need only look at today’s headlines to see how strongly some PC-era leaders are trying to move away from the old model and embrace the new one. IBM’s product and technology portfolio today is built around networked, modularized and embedded technologies, including service-oriented architecture (SOA), information on demand, virtualization and open, modular systems for businesses of all sizes. IBM is a leader in all these areas. Business: Impelled by this new global arena and new technology model, business leaders expanded their horizons—driven both by competitive pressures and a remarkable array of new innovation capabilities. No longer content with cost savings from off-the-shelf technologies and solutions, they were seeking to innovate. And this involved not just their products and services, but their entire companies: business processes, management systems, policies and even their core business model. To accomplish that, they were looking to integrate advanced technology deep into their processes and operations. Our worldwide survey of CEOs has consistently confirmed this shift in businesses’ perceptions and priorities. To deliver this kind of client value requires intimate knowledge of each client and the ability to make that knowledge operational on a daily basis—and that can’t be done from corporate headquarters. So we changed our own processes and organization to push decision-making and delegation closer to the marketplace. Put it all together, and IBM today is very different from what it was when we entered the decade. We are different strategically, with clarity around our twin imperatives of innovation and global integration. We are different operationally, with a lower center of gravity in our operations and with continually improving efficiency and productivity. And we have a business model that is better aligned with our clients’ needs and that generates stronger profitability and cash flow. We see no major strategic shift on the horizon for our company. So, how is this transformed company performing? Let me briefly recap 2007. It was, quite simply, a great year for IBM. Revenue and income: We delivered our strongest revenue growth since 2003 and our strongest profit performance in more than a decade. Our revenue as reported was a record $98.8 billion, up 8 percent. Pretax income from continuing operations was $14.5 billion, an increase of 9 percent and another record. Margins: IBM’s gross profit margin rose for the fourth consecutive year—to 42.2 percent, up more than five points since 2003. We achieved this by continuing to shift our business mix to more profitable segments, such as software, and by focusing on productivity. Our pretax income margin rose to 14.7 percent. Both margins are at their highest in more than a decade. The improvement in our pretax 
income margin compares very favorably to our technology peers and to the companies of the Dow 30. We have reversed the margin decline of the late 1990s, and we have a stronger business model today, with less volatility and more high-profit revenue opportunity. Earnings per share: We have continued to achieve strong EPS growth. Last year was another record, with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.18, up 18 percent. This marked 20 straight quarters of EPS growth. Cash flow: IBM has consistently generated strong cash flow. In 2007 our net cash from operations, excluding the year-to-year change in Global Financing receivables, was $17.4 billion—an increase of $2.1 billion from last year. Our business model has allowed us to generate more than $70 billion in cash flow over the past five years. IBM ended 2007 with $16.1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Investment and return to shareholders: Our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business—through strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to drive growth—and to generate substantial returns to investors through increased dividends and significant share repurchase. Our 2007 cash investment was $1 billion for 12 acquisitions—six of them in key areas of software. And after investing $6.2 billion in R&D and $5 billion in net capital expenditures, we were able to return a record of nearly $21 billion to you—$18.8 billion through share repurchase and $2.1 billion through dividends—or more than 100 percent of our net earnings. This year’s dividend increase was 33 percent, marking the 12th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend. In the last two years, IBM has doubled its quarterly dividend. Our balance sheet remains strong, and the company is well positioned to take advantage of new strategic opportunities. The results of IBM’s strategic choices and actions over the last several years have been better client focus, clearer marketplace differentiation and a stronger financial engine. We have also achieved superior flexibility—a competitive advantage in uncertain economic times. This strengthened business model and our excellent performance in 2007 have increased our confidence that we will meet our 2010 objective of $10 to $11 in earnings per share. I think the information on pages 6 to 7 will help you understand the sources of that confidence. We have entered 2008 with strong momentum—but can we sustain it? This is a legitimate question, especially given the current economic indicators in the United States and other parts of the developed world. A number of companies aren’t sounding very optimistic. At IBM, we have a different view. The reason why is best understood in terms of five key factors that differentiate our company today. 1. Our global reach and scale. IBM’s global operations are accelerating our company’s growth. IBM today does business in 170 countries and enjoys an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution of revenue. In 2007, 63 percent of our revenue came from outside the United States. Many people think of “emerging markets” as the so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China—and last year our revenue increased 26 percent in those markets. But our global footprint extends much farther. Consider more than 50 countries— including Czech Republic, Poland, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Venezuela and Mexico—in each of which we grew more than 10 percent in local currency in 2007. In aggregate, IBM’s business in this group grew at a rate of more than 20 percent in local currency last year and comprised 15 percent of our geographic revenues. 2. Our infrastructure leadership. IBM arguably invented the concept of the data center, and today our solutions provide a foundation for more of the world’s IT infrastructure than any other company. So we are well positioned to serve businesses across the world’s emerging markets that are installing their first data centers —as well as those in the developed world that are upgrading and transforming their existing infrastructure. However, today’s opportunity is not simply about replicating or upgrading what already exists. The data center itself is going through its most significant transformation in decades. According to one IT analyst firm, more than 70 percent of Global 1000 companies will have to modify their data centers significantly during the next five years. This is driven not only by new technology but by new business imperatives: constraints on power and real estate; systems that are grossly underutilized; and the need for greater flexibility to innovate business processes and models. These needs have shaped our transformed portfolio. Our green data center solutions dramatically impact energy efficiency and physical space constraints, while also helping our planet. Demand is climbing for these solutions, and we hit more than $400 million in signings last year, after introducing the offering in the third quarter. Virtualization, which significantly improves system utilization, generated about $200 million in incremental gross profit for us in 2007. And our industry-leading solutions in SOA enable clients to reinvent their entire business model. Clients in both the developed and developing worlds will be migrating to this new data center model, and IBM is very well positioned.
3. Our technology leadership. IBM’s leadership position in IT infrastructure is underpinned by a superior technology base. In 2007, for the 15th consecutive year, IBM was issued more U.S. patents (3,125) than any other company. And our offerings in the year ahead look especially promising. Major IBM product launches will include our next-generation System z mainframe; System p servers, which bring POWER6 innovation to the entry level; and POWER-based virtualization offerings, which improve energy and space efficiency for UNIX customers. We are also introducing a new BladeCenter offering and a highly innovative storage architecture, thanks to our acquisition of XIV. Finally, we expect to see continued strong growth in strategic middleware fueled by organic investment and strategic software acquisitions—such as FileNet and Cognos, which have augmented our information on demand capabilities. 4. Our delivery of unique client value. As we head into uncertain economic times in some parts of the world, one fact remains constant: Businesses continue to invest in IT. It saves them money and manages business-critical needs—such as enterprise security, real-time analytics, risk management, business intelligence, business optimization and transformation, as well as how a company expands its client base in order to gain share. Companies are seeking to identify and classify security risks and protect their data from all forms of attack. They face regulatory demands and pressure to increase productivity without buying more “stuff.” They need to use both structured and unstructured data—such as the information contained in memos, reports and phone calls—to generate reports to their customers in minutes, not days. In addition, we are seeing multiple areas of investment growth within particular industries. For example, telecommunications companies continue to upgrade their infrastructure to broadband. Also, utilities face outdated systems, the transformation from analog to digital and new regulatory requirements. Across the world, businesses and institutions are continuing to make investments that save them money, preserve capital and address issues they simply may not defer. 5. Our financial strength and flexibility. As I’ve described, our focus on higher-value offerings helps drive profitable growth and strong cash generation, which have enabled IBM to return value to shareholders and to invest opportunistically for growth. We also possess the financial capacity to adjust to changes in near-term business conditions, thanks to a business model in which about 50 percent of the company’s revenues are recurring streams—far less subject to volatility in uncertain economic conditions. We believe these differentiating capabilities—our global presence and integration; preeminence in the data center; technology leadership; and the ability to deliver measurable client value—will be drivers of profitable growth in both good times and bad. As a result, we believe that IBM has excellent opportunities in 2008 and beyond—in an environment that presents significant challenges for our competitors. They are not as global, as strong in high-growth segments or as able to deliver complete solutions, nor do many have the experience and discipline to adjust their economic models as conditions require. So we will pursue growth, while at the same time remaining prudent and disciplined about expenses and productivity. That is, we will operate ambidextrously—seizing the new opportunities that the external marketplace presents, while never ceasing to reexamine our own operations or to transform our organization. This is difficult; not every workforce has the focus and maturity to do it. But IBM has been here before, and we know what to do. Historically, this is when we have gone on offense. At the opening of this letter, I said that we intend to capitalize on our strengths in order to seize the growth, profit and leadership opportunities presented by today’s global marketplace. Let me close with some thoughts on what will be required of any company seeking to do that. On the prospects for continued global growth: When people look out at the global economy today, some are concerned about ripple effects. They fear the impact on overall growth—even in the developing world—of a possible downturn in parts of the developed world. Now, I’m not an economist, but let me offer a perspective based on my experiences as I visit IBM’s clients and our own operations around the world. You only have to get outside of the United States to see that something very new is happening today. The world’s growth markets are no longer as dependent on import-export, on the exchange of raw materials for industrial goods. Instead, they are innovating. They are differentiating. Most importantly, their people are becoming consumers; they’re joining the middle class. Hundreds of millions of people are opening their first bank accounts, getting their first cell phones, using their first credit cards. Tens of millions are buying their first automobiles. These are historic developments, and are pretty far removed from economic fluctuations in the United States, Europe and Japan. And consider what has to happen to give all of those people cell phones, financial services and cars. Infrastructure has to be built and developed, and not only the IT infrastructure I discussed earlier, but business infrastructure—for banking, manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation and government services.
Your company knows a thing or two about how to build both kinds of infrastructure to support the way the world works. We’ve been doing that for nearly 100 years. However, our ability to focus on markets that are small today but with great upside potential was inhibited in the past by our own organizational structure. When you group such smaller markets with big ones, they tend to be overshadowed and to lack proper management attention, investment, skills and support. That is the reason we are creating a new Growth Markets organization, to be headquartered in Shanghai. Its goal is to accelerate IBM’s global growth significantly. I believe this is the best way to ensure that these markets get the talent, investment and attention they deserve and need in order to keep growing. On local engagement: To be truly global today, a company has to do a lot more than set up sales offices or research facilities in multiple markets, or send its people on international assignments. Doing business in the developing world is about relationships, not just transactions. You have to engage at the level of culture, as well as process. You have to build trust. You have to be integrated on the ground, working shoulder-to-shoulder with local suppliers, governments and communities, and understanding their point of view on business and innovation. You have to help them advance their agendas, not just your own. And you have to train your leaders everywhere to be global leaders. This takes time. You can’t “leapfrog” into being a global company. You’ve got to be committed for the long term, and you have to invest, on multiple levels. IBM has some unique historical, organizational and skill advantages here—but they will only remain advantages to the extent that we continue to make them real every day, in IBMers’ actions, behavior and relationships as global professionals and global citizens. On developing global professionals and citizens: Of all the issues facing business and society with regard to global integration, perhaps the most challenging is this: How does the individual compete and win in a global economy? This is, on the one hand, what makes globalization such an emotional and polarizing issue to many people. But it also opens up some of the most promising opportunities for organizational innovation in business today—driven by the need to help our people succeed in this new environment. Last year we introduced the IBM Global Citizen’s Portfolio. It aims to provide our employees with the tools they need to enhance their expertise in a global context. Those tools include a matching fund to support the IBMer’s own learning and exploration—even if not related to his or her current job. We are helping retiring IBMers to transition to second careers in teaching, government service and nongovernmental organizations. And we’ve established a program called the Corporate Service Corps, in which teams of high-potential IBMers from around the world—our leaders of the future—will come together for one-month projects on economic development, environmental and other problems in developing countries. The underlying idea here is that individuals are in the best position to make decisions about their own work, learning and careers. This shift of control and decision-making to the IBMer represents a very new relationship between enterprises and individuals—and that involves a certain degree of risk. Sharing power always does. But if you trust your strategy, your capabilities and your people —and if you are confident that all are grounded in a set of shared values—then this is the kind of innovation you pursue. It’s one more example of playing offense in a very new game. I’m deeply gratified that our employees’ reaction to the Global Citizen’s Portfolio has been so enthusiastic. We are, for instance, oversubscribed by thousands of applicants for the Corporate Service Corps. IBMers have a very mature understanding of today’s new environment. They know the world is changing. They don’t expect— or in many cases, even want—what business used to provide. What they do want is an opportunity and some help to learn and grow, so they can effectively compete on a world stage. This is probably the single strongest reason for my confidence in IBM’s future. As we enter a new era of technology, business and global society, I am proud of the worldwide IBM team for bringing us to this point, and I am grateful to you, our shareholders, for your support in our journey. I hope and trust that you are pleased with how your company is growing and evolving. My colleagues and I are excited by the possibilities for how we, together with our clients, our partners and you, can bring this remarkable enterprise into its next era of leadership and discovery

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2008,"Dear IBM Investor: As I write to you, the global economy is experiencing profound disruption. There is a great deal of understandable and appropriate anxiety about where we are headed in the near and medium term. Many approaches are being offered to stimulate economic recovery and growth. And it is clear that IBM’s industry, as well as many others, will look very different a few years from now. You need to know, in this time of turmoil, that your company is well positioned to continue delivering strong results, as we have been doing and did again in 2008— achieving record revenue, record pre-tax earnings, record earnings per share and record free cash flow. Even more importantly, we are also positioned to lead in the new era that lies on the other side of the present crisis. In this letter, I will explain why. I will describe how this moment of historic change presents an opportunity for IBM, not only to assert leadership in our industry, but to play a central role in changing how the world literally works. Our confidence is grounded in the strategic transformation of IBM over the past several years and the focused execution of nearly 400,000 dedicated and innovative women and men around the world. IBM is now a very different company than it was just a few years ago. As a result, we entered this turbulent period strong, and we expect to exit it stronger. 
A New Era—and a New IBM What explains our strong performance, when so many of our competitors and other companies across business are struggling during a deep economic slowdown? The answer lies at the beginning of this decade, when the IT industry and businesses everywhere were confronted by three fundamental shifts in the world: 1. the reality of global integration. I don’t mean simply the widely shared recognition that the world was becoming “flat,” but the way in which that was happening, and what it meant for the goals and the very forms of organizations. The lowering of trade barriers, the rise of the developing world and the emergence of the World Wide Web combined to unleash the flow of work on a truly global scale. Therefore, the key questions facing leaders of all kinds became: How will we get that work to flow to us? How will we differentiate ourselves in a global economy? And how will we capture the new growth opportunities that are emerging around the world? Increasingly, new business models—in fact, a new model of the corporation itself—began to take shape. At IBM, we called it the Globally Integrated Enterprise. 2. the emergence of a new computing model. This new model, which was replacing the PC-based, client/server approach, was networked, modular and open. Just as important, it was no longer confined to IT systems alone. Increasingly, the digital infrastructure of the world was merging with the physical infrastructure of the world. And that was creating a new platform for the global economy and society. We are now living in a world that is: – instrumented: Computational power is being put into things no one would recognize as computers: phones, cameras, cars, appliances, roadways, power lines, clothes—and even natural systems, such as livestock and rivers. – interconnected: All of this is being connected through the Internet, which has come of age. – intelligent: We now have the computing power, advanced analytics and new computing models (such as “cloud”) to make sense of the world’s digital knowledge and pulse, and to turn mountains of data into intelligence. 3. innovation and integration. Because of this new global arena and new technology model, business leaders expanded their horizons—driven both by competitive pressures and the remarkable array of new capabilities. No longer content with cost savings from off-the-shelf technologies and solutions, they were seeking to innovate—and not just in their products and services, but also their business processes, management systems, policies and core business models. To accomplish that, they sought to integrate advanced technology far deeper into their operations.
At IBM, we saw that these shifts would reshape the economic, technological and competitive landscape, and open up enormous business opportunity. So we made some important decisions, and we got to work. global integration: We made major investments in our teams and capabilities in emerging markets around the world. This is helping us achieve superior growth in emerging markets— not only in the so¬called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, but in dozens of countries across the developing world. At the same time, we accelerated the global integration of IBM’s operations. As a result, our supply chain, research labs, software development and service delivery today are truly global in scope. We have made substantial progress toward remaking IBM into a Globally Integrated Enterprise, with more still to do. technology: We transformed IBM’s mix of products, services, skills and technologies— exiting commoditizing businesses like PCs and hard disk drives, and making more than 100 strategic acquisitions this decade. We also shifted our internal R&D. Of the more than 4,000 U.S. patents IBM received in 2008 (our 16th straight year of patent leadership), more than 70 percent were for software and services. IBM’s portfolio today is built around networked, modularized and embedded technologies, such as service¬oriented architecture (SOA), virtualization, business intelligence and analytics. As a result, we are well positioned to build the kinds of IT infrastructures and solutions that will be of the highest value to our clients. business: The kind of value our clients sought required a partner with intimate knowledge of their industry, and with the ability to turn that knowledge into company¬specific operational and management systems. You can’t do that on a global scale from corporate headquarters. So we not only amassed considerable industry expertise, but also made major changes in how we deploy it. We shifted skills and decisionmaking closer to the marketplace and the client. At the same time, we transformed our vast services delivery capability. We applied automation, standardization and the kinds of engineering and management principles that were long ago adopted in manufacturing and supply chains. The results are showing up in our margins and in our best¬in¬class levels of service delivery client satisfaction. We Enter this Period Strong Put it all together, IBM today is a very different company, which is evident in our results. Since the dot¬com crash in 2002, we have more than doubled our pre¬tax income and free cash flow, and more than tripled our earnings per share. Our standout 2008 continued this record of superior performance. 
revenue and income: Our revenue was a record $103.6 billion, up 5 percent. In 2008 we grew pre-tax income from continuing operations by 15 percent, to $16.7 billion, the highest ever. margins: IBM’s gross profit margin rose for the fifth consecutive year—to 44.1 percent, up 7.6 points since 2003. Our pre-tax income margin rose to 16.1 percent. Both margins are at their highest in more than a decade. We achieved this by driving productivity and continuing to shift our business mix to more profitable segments. More than 90 percent of our segment profit in 2008 was from software, services and financing. earnings per share: We have continued to achieve strong EPS growth. Last year was another record, with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.93, up 24 percent. This marked six straight years of double-digit EPS growth. cash flow: IBM has consistently generated strong cash flow. In 2008 our free cash flow, excluding the year-to-year change in Global Financing receivables, was $14.3 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion from 2007. Our business model has allowed us to generate more than $84 billion in free cash flow over the past nine years. IBM ended 2008 with $12.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. investment and return to shareholders: Our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business and to generate substantial returns to investors. Our 2008 cash investment was $6.3 billion for 15 acquisitions—10 of them in key areas of software. And after investing $6.3 billion in R&D and $4.5 billion in net capital expenditures, we were able to return more than $13 billion to you—$10.6 billion through share repurchase and $2.6 billion through dividends. Last year’s dividend increase was 25 percent, marking the 13th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend. In this environment, clients’ immediate needs are very clear: to save money, preserve capital and reduce costs. We help them do that, and our ability to deliver that kind of value is why they are continuing to choose IBM. It’s why our services business achieved its highest margin in the past five years. It’s why our software business continues to grow so robustly—with pre-tax profit doubling over the past five years, to $7 billion in 2008. And it’s why we continue to enjoy strength in highutilization, high-performance infrastructure. 
In sum, with our excellent financial position, strong balance sheet, solid recurring revenue, strong profit streams and unmatched global reach, we are confident about 2009 and are ahead of pace to achieve our 2010 objective of $10 to $11 in earnings per share. The information on pages 10–15—“Generating Higher Value at IBM”—will help explain why. A Smarter Planet The coming era will not be kind to enterprises or institutions that have failed to step up to unresolved issues in their core models, strategies or operations. In our view, this is not simply a cyclical downturn, but a major shift in the global economy and society—one that is simple to state, but profound in its implications. In the last two decades, we have seen our planet become smaller and “flatter.” In the next two, we will see it become smarter. This isn’t a metaphor, and I’m not talking about the Knowledge Economy—or even the fact that hundreds of millions of people from developing nations are gaining the education and skills to enter the global workforce. I mean the infusion of intelligence into the way the world actually works: the systems and processes that enable physical goods to be developed, manufactured, bought and sold; services to be delivered; everything from people and money to oil, water and electrons to move; and billions of people to work and live. Through pervasive instrumentation and interconnection, almost anything—any person, any object, any process or any service, for any organization, large or small—can become digitally aware, networked and intelligent. This means that industries, infrastructures, processes and entire societies can be more productive, efficient and responsive. And problems that have heretofore been insoluble can now be tackled. Problems like wasting too much energy. Like spending too much time in traffic. Like producing food too expensively, and wasting too much of what we produce. Like missing too many sales opportunities and disappointing too many customers because of inefficient supply chains. Like making too many medical errors, and spending too much to deliver healthcare to too few. And most obviously of late, like failing to manage financial risk.
These and other systems by which the world works are increasingly unsustainable. They may be networked, but it turns out that being connected isn’t enough. It doesn’t make them smart. But the good news is, they can be. 
We know this because IBM is building these systems today, in collaboration with forwardthinking clients around the world. In them, we can see a foreshadowing of how banking will work, how telecommunications will work, how energy, healthcare, transportation and retail will work. We can see a world that is becoming smarter before our eyes. smarter traffic: Stockholm’s intelligent traffic system, created by IBM, has resulted in 20 percent less gridlock, a 12-percent drop in emissions and a reported 40,000 additional daily users of public transport. IBM is building smart traffic systems in cities from London to Brisbane to Singapore—with many more being planned. smarter power grids: IBM today is leading seven of the world’s top ten automated meter management projects. Our intelligent utility network with CenterPoint Energy enables remote sensing and operation of the electric grid, connection and disconnection of service, fewer and shorter outages, improved customer service and the integration of new, environmentally friendly power sources such as wind and solar— as well as the charging of plug-in electric vehicles. In Malta, we will build the world’s first national smart grid, which will also instrument and monitor the country’s water systems. smarter healthcare: The cost of therapy is being lowered by as much as 90 percent. For example, IBM technology is being used to monitor the proper delivery of injections and vaccines to more than 2 million patients in 38 states. And, partnering with Google and the Continua Health Alliance, we have introduced software that will enable data from personal medical devices to feed a patient’s electronic health record. smarter food systems: IBM built a system for Norway’s largest food supplier that uses RFID technology to trace meat and poultry from the farm, through the supply chain, all the way to supermarket shelves. smarter money: Foreign currency exchange is the world’s largest single market. Thanks to a smart financial system IBM developed, intraday settlement risk for more than $2 trillion in daily volume—more than 60 percent of the world’s foreign exchange transactions—has been effectively eliminated. And through technologyenabled microfinance, organizations like Grameen Foundation and Financial Information Network and Operations Ltd. (FINO) are providing poor people around the world with collateral-free loans and financial services to support income-generating businesses. smarter telecommunications: IBM is helping traditional telecom service providers, mobile and broadband operators and broadcasters transform their networks and services. IBM’s solutions are being used in India to deliver new services dynamically to support 185 million mobile phone subscribers—more than half of the total Indian market for mobile services.
smarter water: We can even use computer modeling to simulate, monitor—and potentially manage—the behavior of river basins around the world, as Water for Tomorrow, a collaboration between IBM and The Nature Conservancy, is now doing in Brazil, China and the U.S. In every one of these examples—and there are many more—we see improved productivity, efficiency, responsiveness, profitability and societal benefit. With so much technology and networking abundantly available at such low cost, what service wouldn’t you provide a customer, citizen, student or patient? What wouldn’t you connect? What information wouldn’t you mine for insight? The answer is, you—or your competitor— will do all of that. You will do it because you can, because the technology is both available and affordable. And governments and societies around the world will do it because they must. As I talk to leaders everywhere from business, government and across civil society, I am hearing the same urgency for action, the same need for significant investment, and the same focus on not simply repairing what’s broken, but preparing for a new economy in a new century. In particular, there is widespread and growing recognition of the importance of smart infrastructure. Our conversations around the world are giving us confidence that IBM is well positioned to address society’s and businesses’ most urgent needs. We will be aggressive in our pursuit of this opportunity. Indeed, you will be hearing and seeing much more about our smarter planet vision in the weeks and months ahead, as we establish our point of view, build the right relationships and offer smart solutions in the marketplace. We Will Emerge Stronger In closing, I think it’s worthwhile to step back and consider this moment, and our response to it, in a broader context. Many companies are reacting to the current global downturn by drastically curtailing spending and investment, even in areas that are important to their future. We are taking a different approach. Of course, we must continue to improve our competitiveness. But while we maintain discipline and prudence in the near term, we also maintain the discipline to plan for the future. We’re not looking back, we’re looking ahead. We’re continuing to invest in R&D, in strategic acquisitions, in growth initiatives— and most importantly, during these difficult times, in our people. In other words, we will not simply ride out the storm. Rather, we will take a long-term view, and go on offense. Throughout our history, during periods of disruption and global change, this is what IBM has done. Again and again, we have played a leadership role. We have imagined what the world might be, and actually built it. 
We find ourselves at such a moment now. This is an inflection point—both in the course of modern technology and economic history, and in the nearly 100-year journey of IBM. As someone who has been here for more than a third of that journey, I can tell you that it presents the best opportunity I have seen in my IBM career to align those two trajectories in very powerful ways. From cabinet rooms, to board rooms, to kitchen tables around the world, people are eager for change. Such a mandate doesn’t come around very often—perhaps once in a generation, or once in a century. It’s not something to squander. I and my fellow IBMers have no intention of doing so. Let me close by expressing my pride in the worldwide IBM team for bringing us to this point, and my gratitude to you, our shareholders, for your unwavering support. I hope that you are pleased with how your company is performing and evolving. And I trust that you share our excitement about the role we can play in what promises to be a new era for o

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2009,"Dear IBM Investor: When I wrote to you a year ago, the global economy was experiencing profound disruption. The financial system was freezing up. Many companies and entire industries were pulling in their horns, hoping simply to ride out the storm. IBM’s own industry was no different. Nonetheless, I said that we felt confident heading into 2009. We were entering the year strong, and we expected to exit it stronger. A year later, despite an environment that remains very challenging, I am happy to report that your company has continued to outperform our industry and the market at large. We delivered strong results in 2009, once again achieving record pre-tax earnings, record earnings per share and record free cash flow—despite reduced revenues. At the same time, we continued to deliver superior returns to you, our owners. Most importantly, we are well positioned to grow as the economy begins to recover.
The explanation for this performance—and for our optimism about both the near-term and the longer-term future—is threefold. It rests, first, on the ongoing transformation of our company; second, on our focused strategy to capture the large opportunity of a globally integrating world; and third, on a business model that reliably generates strong profits and cash, giving us the financial flexibility to invest for future growth. I will talk about each of these factors in detail in this letter. It is important for you to understand the ways in which IBM today is a very different company than it was just a few years ago. This repositioning explains why we have demonstrated such stability and strong results during this downturn and why we believe we will benefit as the economy recovers and growth returns. A Strong Year Capping a Strong Decade Two thousand nine was a tough year by any measure, but IBM’s performance was indicative both of our high-value market position and of the discipline we apply to our strategy and operations. Since the dot-com crash in 2002, we have added $12 billion to IBM’s pre-tax profit base, increased our pre-tax margin 2.5 times, quadrupled our earnings per share and more than doubled our free cash flow. Cumulatively, we have generated about $80 billion of free cash flow. Our strong 2009 continued this record of superior performance: margins: IBM’s gross profit margin rose for the sixth consecutive year—to 45.7 percent, up 9.2 points since 2003. Our pre-tax income margin rose to 18.9 percent. Both margins are at their highest in more than a decade.We achieved this by driving productivity and continuing to shift our business mix to more profitable segments. Once again, more than 90 percent of our segment profit in 2009 was from software, services and financing. earnings per share: We have continued to achieve strong EPS growth. Last year was another record, with diluted earnings per share of $10.01, up 13 percent. This marked seven straight years in which we have grown EPS by double digits. cash flow: IBM has consistently generated strong cash flow, a key indicator of real business performance. In 2009 our free cash flow, excluding the year-to-year change in Global Financing receivables, was $15.1 billion, an increase of $800 million from 2008. IBM ended 2009 with $14 billion of cash and marketable securities. revenue and income: Our revenue was $95.8 billion, down 5 percent at constant currency. Nonetheless, in 2009 we grew pre-tax income from continuing operations by 9 percent, to $18.1 billion, our highest ever.
investment and return to shareholders: Our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business and to generate substantial returns to investors. Our 2009 cash investment was $1.2 billion for six acquisitions—five of them in key areas of software. And after investing $5.8 billion in R&D and $3.7 billion in net capital expenditures, we were able to return more than $10 billion to you—$7.4 billion through share repurchase and $2.9 billion through dividends. Last year’s dividend increase was 10 percent, marking the 14th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend. In sum, with our excellent financial position, strong balance sheet, solid recurring revenue, strong profit streams and unmatched global reach, we are confident about the year ahead, and beyond. Indeed, we achieved our 2010 objective of $10 to $11 in earnings per share one year early. We believe that we will again grow EPS by double digits this year, reaching at least $11. The information on pages 10 through 15— “A Decade of Generating Higher Value at IBM”— summarizes the story of our transformation, and describes the opportunities it has opened up for growth in the coming era. Leading Our Industry and the Market As we enter a new decade, it’s interesting to reflect upon how the last one began. The conventional wisdom back then was that the robust IT growth of the go-go ’90s would continue—and even after the dot-com bust, most believed it would resume. It was thought that buyers of IT would continue to self-integrate—which would mean that our industry would remain highly disaggregated—and that client/server computing would become the predominant enterprise model. It wasn’t unreasonable to hold these views. However, as we looked out, we saw a different picture—an undercurrent of fundamental change. As we worked to understand the deeper meaning of events, to separate the cyclical from the secular and to apply lessons from our own past, we came to believe that major shifts were underway that would reshape our industry and, indeed, the global economy: 1. Changes in the World: The lowering of trade barriers, the rise of the developing world and the emergence of the World Wide Web were unleashing the flow of work on a global scale. We believed these changes were powerful and irreversible, and that they would lead to new business models and a new form of the corporation itself—what we came to call the globally integrated enterprise. 
2. Changes in Technology: At the same time, a new model of computing was replacing the PC-based, client/server approach. Computational capability was being put into things no one would recognize as computers: phones, cameras, cars, appliances, roadways, power lines, clothes—and even natural systems, such as agriculture and rivers. All of this was being connected through the Internet. And we now had the computing power, advanced analytics and new models (now known as “clouds”) to turn mountains of data into insight. As a result, the economic, societal and physical systems of the world were becoming instrumented, interconnected and intelligent. Our planet was becoming smarter. 3. Changes in Client Demand: Compelled by the new opportunities and competitive demands of these first two shifts, enterprises and institutions were no longer content with cost savings from off-the-shelf technologies and solutions. They now sought to innovate—not just in their products and services, but also their business processes, management systems, policies and core business models. To accomplish that, they needed to integrate advanced technology far deeper into their operations. Because we believed that these shifts would change our industry, creating winners and losers, we made some important decisions and got to work. We transformed IBM’s mix of products, services, skills and technologies—exiting commoditizing businesses like PCs and hard disk drives, and making 108 strategic acquisitions over the course of the decade. We amassed substantial industry expertise, and also re-invented the way we deploy it, shifting skills and decision making closer to the marketplace and the client. We invested significantly more in our teams and capabilities in emerging markets around the world, and we accelerated the global integration of IBM’s operations. At the same time, we transformed our vast services delivery capability, applying automation, standardization and advanced engineering and management principles of the sort that prior generations had applied to manufacturing. We also rebalanced our internal R&D. Today, IBM’s portfolio is built around networked, modularized and embedded technologies, such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), business intelligence and analytics. Of the more than 4,900 U.S. patents IBM received in 2009 (our 17th straight year of patent leadership, and a record for any company), more than 70 percent were for software and services. That’s how the last decade played out—for our industry and for your company. The Landscape for Growth Today, many of our competitors are emulating our moves. For instance, several have gone on an acquisition binge to get into new spaces. However, there is a vast difference between what your company has done—amassing truly differentiating technology and skills, and focusing on the needs of enterprise clients— and what others are doing, largely to compensate for rapidly commoditizing business models.
As the new decade begins, some in our industry still seem to believe that history will repeat itself— for example, that clients will invest in IT simply because of product upgrade cycles. Once again, we have a different view. We believe that clients will only invest in what delivers compelling, quantifiable business value. We believe that the fundamental shifts I described earlier will continue to play out, and that they create a unique opportunity for IBM. And because of the way we have managed the company during the economic downturn, we have the flexibility to take advantage of this opportunity, and to invest for growth. Our investments in 2010 are focused on four high-potential opportunities. 1.Growth Markets IBM has among the broadest global footprints of any corporation or institution. We serve clients in more than 170 countries around the world, and we have been deeply established within myriad local economies and cultures for decades. Our Growth Markets unit, established in 2008, is helping to capture the highest-growth opportunities of the world’s emerging economies. Since 2005, these markets have expanded their contribution to IBM’s geographic revenue by a point a year, growing at least 8 points faster than major markets over the last three years. Going forward, both mature and emerging markets are building out and integrating their physical and digital infrastructures, and infusing the resulting systems with intelligence. More than $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus has already been earmarked by governments around the world. We are uniquely positioned to benefit from these large business and technology opportunities, and we are pursuing them aggressively in 2010. 2. Analytics Data is being captured today as never before— both from the so-called Internet of Things (heading toward trillions of connected objects) and from hundreds of millions of individuals using social media. In just three years, IP traffic is expected to total more than half a zettabyte. (That’s a trillion gigabytes— or 1 followed by 21 zeroes.) And this data no longer consists merely of text and numbers. It includes rich media of all kinds, from video and audio, to images, avatars, simulations and applications. Thirty percent of the data in the world today consists of medical images alone. All this information—the knowledge of the world, the flow of markets, the pulse of societies— can now be turned into insight through sophisticated mathematical models, also known as analytics. Where once we inferred, now we know. Where once we interpolated and extrapolated, now we can determine. The historical is giving way to the realtime, and even the predictive. IBM is moving quickly to capitalize on this promise. We have built the industry’s premier analytics practice, with 4,000 consultants, mathematicians and researchers, as well as leading-edge software capabilities—bolstered by key acquisitions such as Cognos and SPSS. Our new Business Analytics and Optimization service line targets the highest-growth opportunities by delivering integrated analytics solutions based on the needs of specific industries. 
3. Cloud and Next-Generation Data Center As our planet becomes instrumented, interconnected and intelligent, the computing model is evolving to support it. Think of it as the industrialization of IT. Over the past generation, our digital infrastructures have become very complex and inefficient, so now we’re optimizing them through automation, creating systems that are highly tuned to the specific workloads they run and to new consumption and delivery models, such as clouds. Thus, the data center is shifting from being a single physical place to something more like the Internet, a diverse set of services fueled by IT. This provides far more choice and flexibility, of particular interest to the many businesses and governments that want simply to consume some services they once built, maintained and provided themselves. It also makes possible things that were not previously so, such as modeling systemic risk or creating integrated healthcare records. However, with these new possibilities come new challenges, in areas such as security. As a result, our clients are seeking help in architecting and building a new kind of highly efficient infrastructure that is reliable and secure, even as it integrates services from a variety of external sources. We have invested billions of dollars in R&D and acquisitions to build leadership in two key dimensions of this new IT model: service management 
software and optimized systems. We have also established a portfolio of cloud services that clients can access externally from IBM or offer internally to users on their own premises. And because of IBM’s track record of integrating new technology paradigms like open source and the Internet into the enterprise, we have earned the trust of clients and the industry to bring reliability and security to what is new. 4. Smarter Planet All of these growth strategies come together in the opportunity we call “smarter planet.” This is not a metaphor. It describes the infusion of intelligence into the way the world actually works, the way that almost anything— any person, any object, any process or any service, for any organization, large or small— can now become digitally aware, networked and intelligent. This means that industries, infrastructures, processes, cities and entire societies can be more productive, efficient and responsive. 
We developed this agenda and strategic initiative in the summer of 2008, and we launched it that autumn—at the peak of the economic crisis. We did so because we believed it represented a pragmatic way to address the very problems that were transfixing the world. After just a year, it is clear that our belief was correct. The idea of “smarter systems” is resonating with decision-makers in both the private and public sectors. We are seeing these systems being implemented in every major industry and across every region of both the developed and developing worlds. And they are creating measurable economic and societal value. • In a study of 439 cities, those that employ smarter transportation solutions—including ramp metering, signal coordination and incident management—reduced travel delays on average by more than 700,000 hours annually. • Eight hospitals and 470 primary care clinics in Spain implemented smarter healthcare systems across their facilities— and improved clinical results and operational efficiency by up to 10 percent. • Banks and other financial services organizations around the world are achieving new levels of risk control, efficiency and customer service. For instance, payment processing costs at the Bank of Russia have been reduced by 95 percent. And CLS Bank now handles most of the world’s currency exchange transactions, securely eliminating the risk from trades worth $3.5 trillion per day, and growing. 
• Four leading retailers have reduced supply chain costs by up to 30 percent, reduced inventory levels by up to 25 percent, and increased sales up to 10 percent. They’ve done so by analyzing customer buying behaviors, aligning merchandising assortments with demand and building end-to-end visibility across their entire supply chain. This list could go on. We are quantifying the outcomes of hundreds and hundreds of smarter systems, and this measurable value gives leaders everywhere the confidence to try something new. So the questions we are hearing are no longer about whether a smarter planet is a real possibility. Now, there is an enormous hunger to learn how. CEOs, CIOs, governors and mayors are asking questions like: How do I infuse intelligence into a system for which no one enterprise or agency is responsible? How do I bring all the necessary 
constituents together? How do I make the case for budget? How do I coalesce support with citizens? Where should I start? In 2010, we are focusing our efforts on helping clients answer those questions in nine high-growth industries: healthcare; oil and gas; energy and utilities; transportation; telecommunications; retail; banking; government; and electronics. At the same time, we are continuing to push the scientific frontiers at the core of smarter technologies. Today, more than 25 percent of IBM Research’s work is on smarter planet projects, and we are in the process of doubling that to more than 50 percent, in areas such as mobile Web, nanotechnology, stream computing, analytics and cloud. Seizing the Opportunity Before Us The opportunity to make our planet smarter is both real and inspiring. It has excited forwardthinking leaders in industry, government and across civil society in both mature and growth markets. Encouragingly, but not surprisingly, it has also energized IBMers. Over nearly a century, IBM’s greatest achievements have arisen from our distinctive culture and values. This is why, despite the current economic climate, I am optimistic about IBM’s prospects to lead the era we are now entering. Underneath the surface turmoil, this moment presents a rich 
and transformational opportunity. Everywhere around the world, people are eager for change. And every day, more and more forward-thinking leaders are creating tangible outcomes and benefits, making their parts of our planet smarter. Like IBMers, they recognize that we cannot wait, cannot let this moment pass. They know the time to act is now. And the way to act is together. Let me close by expressing my pride in the 400,000 women and men of the global IBM team who have brought us to this point. And let me express my gratitude to you, our shareholders, for your unwavering support. I hope that you are pleased with how your company is performing and evolving. And I trust that you share our excitement about the role we can play in what promises to be a new epoch for our industry, for business and for our planet.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2010,"Dear IBM Investor: I am pleased to report that IBM had another strong year in 2010. Your company continued to outperform our industry and the market at large. We once again achieved record pre-tax earnings, record earnings per share, record free cash flow and improved profit margins, with increased revenues. At the same time, we continued to deliver superior returns to you, our owners. Most importantly, we are well positioned to grow as the global economy recovers. These results were made possible by decisions and actions that we undertook a decade ago, based on where we believed the world was shifting. But even more, they are a reflection of the mindset, ambitions and values that have guided IBM since its inception, 100 years ago. As such, our performance in 2010 marks a fitting conclusion to our first century as a corporation, and a promising start to our second. In this letter, I will explain why the long-term thinking and management that IBM has practiced over the past decade have positioned your company advantageously for the next five years and beyond.
IBM today IBM’s performance in 2010 is indicative both of our high-value market position and of the discipline we apply to our strategy and operations. Since 2002, we have added $14 billion to IBM’s pre-tax profit base, increased our pre-tax income 3.4 times, our earnings per share 4.7 times and our free cash flow 2.8 times. Cumulatively, we have generated about $96 billion of free cash flow. Our strong 2010 continued this record of superior performance: Revenue and income: Our revenue was $99.9 billion, up 4 percent. In 2010 we grew pre-tax income by 9 percent, to $19.7 billion, our highest ever. Margins: IBM’s gross profit margin rose for the seventh consecutive year—to 46.1 percent, up 9.4 points since 2002. Our pre-tax income margin rose to 19.7 percent. Both margins are at their highest in more than a decade. We achieved this by driving productivity and continuing to shift our business mix to more profitable segments. Once again, more than 90 percent of our segment profit in 2010 was from software, services and financing. Earnings per share: We have continued to achieve strong EPS growth. Last year was another record, with diluted earnings per share of $11.52, up 15 percent. This marked eight straight years of double-digit EPS growth. Cash flow: IBM has consistently generated strong cash flow, a key indicator of real business performance. In 2010 our free cash flow, excluding the year-toyear change in Global Financing receivables, was $16.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from 2009. IBM ended 2010 with $11.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. Investment and return to shareholders: Our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business and to generate substantial returns to investors. Our 2010 cash investment was $6 billion for 17 acquisitions— 13 of them in key areas of software. After investing $6 billion in R&D and $4 billion in net capital expenditures, we were able to return more than $18 billion to you—$15.4 billion through share repurchases and $3.2 billion through dividends. Last year’s dividend increase was 18 percent, marking the 15th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend. Over the past decade, we have returned $107 billion to you in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while investing $70 billion in capital expenditures and acquisitions, and almost $60 billion in R&D. Leading our industry and the market We have been able to achieve these results because of the transformation of our company that we began several years ago. At the time, we saw an undercurrent of fundamental change. 
1. Changes in the world: The lowering of trade barriers, the rise of the developing world and the emergence of the World Wide Web were unleashing the flow of work on a global scale. We believed these changes were powerful and irreversible, and that they would lead to new high-growth market opportunities and a new form of the corporation itself—what we came to call the globally integrated enterprise. 2. Changes in technology: At the same time, a new model of computing was replacing the PC-based, client/server approach. Computational capability was being put into things no one would recognize as computers: phones, cameras, cars, appliances, roadways, power lines, clothes—and even natural systems, such as agriculture and rivers. All of these were being connected. And we had developed the computing power and advanced analytics to turn mountains of data into insight. As a result, the economic, societal and physical systems of the world were becoming instrumented, interconnected and intelligent. Our planet was becoming smarter. 3. Changes in client demand: Driven by the new opportunities and competitive demands of these first two shifts, enterprises and institutions were no longer content with off-the-shelf technology. They now sought to innovate—not just in their products and services, but also their business processes, management systems, policies and core business models. To accomplish that, they needed to focus on the business outcomes that resulted from technological innovation. Now that we have shown we can deliver results with consistency, we are doing it again through the introduction last year of our 2015 Road Map. Because we believed that these shifts would change our industry, creating winners and losers, we transformed IBM’s mix of products, services, skills and technologies—exiting commoditizing businesses like PCs and hard disk drives, and making 116 strategic acquisitions over the course of the decade, largely in software and services. We amassed substantial cross-industry expertise, and reinvented the way we deploy it, shifting skills and decision making closer to the marketplace and the client. We invested significantly more in our teams and capabilities in the developing world, and we accelerated the global integration of IBM’s operations. We also worked to rebalance our internal R&D. Of the 5,896 U.S. patents IBM received in 2010 (once again a record for any company, and our 18th straight year of patent leadership), more than 70 percent were for software and services. 
A road map to the future IBM today is a fundamentally different company. In order to make that clear to our investors and to the financial markets, we decided four years ago to introduce our 2010 Road Map. We wanted to explain where we were going and to provide benchmarks for you to evaluate us along the way. We believed— and still believe—that this longer-term framework is the most helpful way to understand our company. To some, it seemed foolhardy. To my knowledge no company in our industry had done this before. But we felt IBM should take a long-term view, in public as well as in private. And we felt confident about the future, because of the transformational steps we had taken to reposition the company. Clearly, this worked. As you know, we surpassed our 2010 goal of $10 to $11 in earnings per share. And now that we have shown we can deliver results with consistency, we are doing it again through the introduction last year of our 2015 Road Map. As before, our new road map isn’t just a list of targets; it’s a management model, organized around the major drivers of IBM’s earnings per share performance. Those are: operating leverage, share repurchase and growth strategies. Operating leverage will come from our continuing shift to higher-margin businesses and our improving enterprise productivity. We are aiming for $8 billion of productivity improvement over the next five years. Part of that will go to our bottom line, and part will go to investments that improve our competitiveness in the marketplace. Secondly, we will continue returning value to you. Our road map calls for $50 billion in anticipated share repurchases and $20 billion in dividends. When it comes to the third component of our road map, we will focus on four growth priorities: 1. Growth Markets. A historic economic expansion is underway in the emerging markets of the world—as their populations join the middle class and their economies join the global marketplace. These markets are expected to achieve average GDP growth of 5 percent through 2015, more than double the projected growth rate of the developed world. In the largest of these emerging markets, such as China, India and Brazil, IBM is broadening its well-established base of skills and capabilities, nearly doubling our number of branch locations. In less developed markets, such as Africa, we are leveraging anchor clients in sectors like communications and banking. Our recent partnership with Bharti Airtel to provide 21st century wireless telecommunications across 16 countries of SubSaharan Africa is one example. Our Growth Markets Unit accounted for 21 percent of IBM’s geographic revenue in 2010. We are aiming to approach 30 percent by 2015.
2. Business Analytics and Optimization. The research firm IDC predicts that global data volumes will increase by 29 times over the next 10 years—to 35 zettabytes. (A zettabyte is a 1 followed by 21 zeros.) Enterprises need a way to manage and mine this deluge of potentially valuable information, and the key is advanced data analytics. IBM spotted this emerging need early, building the world’s leading analytics practice, with 7,800 expert consultants, the world’s premier nonacademic mathematics function, leading-edge software and offerings integrated by industry. We have received more than 500 analytics patents and have made acquisitions to deepen our capabilities. Under our 2015 Road Map, analytics is expected to grow to $16 billion in revenue by 2015. 3. Cloud and Smarter Computing. As the world becomes more instrumented and interconnected, businesses and institutions need smarter IT infrastructures to handle dramatic increases in data volumes, and to improve data center efficiency. We are creating new ways to design computer systems—optimized for specific workloads—and new ways to deliver IT-infused services. IBM has helped thousands of clients adopt aspects of cloud delivery, where IT resources are virtualized, highly automated and accessed by self-service. We are assisting clients in areas as diverse as banking, healthcare and government to build their own clouds or to tap securely into IBM cloud-based business and infrastructure services. Our road map calls for $7 billion in revenue from cloud by 2015. 4. Smarter Planet. Put it all together, and you have what we mean by “building a smarter planet.” In 2008 and 2009, we articulated a point of view on ways the world can become smarter, and in 2010, we deployed significant resources to capture the opportunity in key, high-growth industries—such as healthcare, retail, banking and telecommunications—where our experience and solution delivery is strongest. We also expanded our Smarter Cities initiative. Our road map calls for Smarter Planet solutions to grow to $10 billion in revenue by 2015. By becoming a very different company from what we were just a few years ago, we have become much more like the company IBM has been for most of its history. In sum, our superior strategic positioning, strong balance sheet, solid recurring revenue, robust profit streams and unmatched global reach give us confidence that we will be able to continue achieving the same kinds of results in the next five years that we have achieved during the past decade. 
Over the last 10 years, we have nearly tripled our EPS, added $109 billion in free cash flow, returned $107 billion to you, tripled our software profits and increased the share of our revenue from growth markets from 11 to 21 percent, excluding divested PCs and printers. Over the next five years, we expect to grow our operating (non-GAAP) earnings to at least $20 per share, to generate another $100 billion in free cash flow, to return an additional $70 billion to you, to grow our software profit to about half of total segment profit and to increase growth markets’ contribution to our revenue to nearly 30 percent. The information on pages 9 to 15—“Generating Higher Value at IBM”—summarizes our road maps, places them in the context of IBM’s 100 years of growth, and describes our opportunities in the coming era. A new century of progress Let me close with a few words on reaching the extraordinary milestone of 100 years, which we will mark on June 16 of this year. Throughout this time, spanning many eras of technology, markets, global economics, politics and culture—and across multiple managements, strategies, innovations, products and services within IBM itself— our company has consistently done three things: First, we have foreseen the opportunities of our times, and made markets in them. These have included the automation of modern retail, banking and air travel; the creation of populationscale systems such as U.S. Social Security; and the farther reaches of scientific progress, from the exploration of space to the frontiers of genomics, bioinformatics and nanotechnology. Today, it encompasses the even broader range of work we describe as building a smarter planet—optimizing the enormously complex systems that enable services to be delivered; physical goods to be developed, manufactured, bought and sold; everything from people and money to oil, water and electrons to move; and billions of people to work and live. Second, we have created the tools to do that ambitious work and to capture its economic opportunity. In the early decades of IBM’s life, this involved clocks, scales and punched card tabulators. It changed fundamentally with the dawn of the computer age, as IBM created many of its technological breakthroughs, from the relational database to the disk drive, DRAM, FORTRAN, the mainframe, the PC and much more. We built the world’s most productive industrial laboratory—home to five Nobel Prize winners and generator of more U.S. patents than any other company in the world. And it continues today, with breakthroughs such as Watson, the computer that recently defeated the two all-time champions on the television quiz show, Jeopardy! Watson’s vast analytic capacity represents a new stage in computing’s ability to tackle the world’s most pressing needs where and when they really emerge—in the natural language of healthcare, banking, government, retail and more.
Finally, we have consistently built an organization that can sustainably deliver that kind of value. This is nontrivial. Over the past century, many enterprises, institutions and governments have come and gone. IBM’s longevity rests on our founders’ success in shaping a particular kind of organization. It was a company that mastered the creation of economic value from knowledge and information; that was truly global—whatever that meant for each era; and that pioneered a new kind of relationship with society. Most importantly, IBM’s leaders believed that a great company could only survive decades of change through the intentional creation of a vibrant culture, one grounded in shared beliefs and values. And they and subsequent generations of IBMers actually built it. That is the legacy of IBM’s first century, and it continues to shape our company today. It is no accident that our growth strategies like Smarter Planet and Growth Markets are aimed at the most promising business and societal opportunities of our era. Nor is it surprising that we are pushing the frontiers of science and technology to achieve those ambitious goals—from analytics, to cloud, to new workload-specific computing models. It is also consistent with our DNA that we have paid equal attention to the continual reinvention of IBM itself—most importantly, reexamining and applying our core values to how we run the company. In a fundamental sense, by becoming a very different company from what we were just a few years ago, we have become much more like the company IBM has been for most of its history. As we start our second century, that’s a good place to be. Let me close by expressing my pride in the worldwide IBM team for bringing us to this point, and my gratitude to you, our shareholders, for your unwavering support. I hope that you are pleased with how your company is performing and evolving. And I trust that you share our excitement about the future of an enterprise whose storied past is propelling us into an enormously promising future.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2011,"A Letter from
the President and CEO 
I am pleased to report that IBM had another strong year in 2011. Your company continued to outperform our industry and the market at large. 
We capped IBM’s first century by achieving record revenue, profit, free cash flow and earnings per share. 
At the same time, we continued to deliver superior returns to you, and we are well positioned for future growth in a globally integrating economy. 
Revenue and income: Our revenue in 2011 was $107 billion, up 7 percent. We grew operating pre-tax income by 9 percent, to $21.6 billion, our highest ever. 
Margins: IBM’s operating pre-tax income margin rose for the ninth consecutive year —to 20.2 percent, up 10 points since 2000. We achieved this by continuing to shift our business mix to more profitable segments and by driving productivity. More than 90 percent of our segment profit in 2011 was from software, services and financing. 
Earnings per share: We have continued to achieve strong EPS growth. Last year was another record, with diluted operating earnings per share of $13.44, up 
15 percent. This marked nine straight years of double- digit EPS growth. 
Cash flow: IBM has consistently generated strong cash flow, a key indicator of real business performance. In 2011 our free cash flow was $16.6 billion. We have improved our free cash flow by nearly $10 billion over the past decade. We ended 2011 with $11.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. 
Investment and return to shareholders: Our cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business and to generate substantial returns to investors, while spending
$6.3 billion on R&D. In 2011 we invested $1.8 billion for five acquisitions in key areas of software and $4.1 billion in net capital expenditures. We were able to return
$18.5 billion to you—$15 billion through share repurchases and $3.5 billion through dividends. Last year’s dividend increase was 15 percent, marking the 16th 
year in a row in which we have raised our dividend, and the 96th consecutive year in which we have paid one. 
A road map to the future 
This performance was the result of disciplined execution by more than 400,000 IBMers and the strategic repositioning of the company over the past decade. We have steadily realigned our business to lead in a 
new era of computing and to enable our clients to benefit from the new capabilities that era is creating. As a consequence, our investors benefit from a business model that is both sustainable over the long term
and fueled by some of the world’s most attractive high- growth markets and technologies. 
You see this expressed in financial terms in our EPS road maps. We introduced our first in 2007, and surpassed our 2010 objectives. Now, we are well on track toward our 2015 Road Map goal of at least $20 in operating earnings per share. 
As before, the road map is not simply a list of targets,
but a management model built on exploiting multiple ways to create value. Operating leverage will come
from our continuing shift to higher-margin businesses and improving enterprise productivity —expected to
be $8 billion over this five-year period. We will create value for shareholders through an anticipated $50 billion in share repurchases and $20 billion in dividends. 
When it comes to growth strategies, we are focused on four high-growth spaces that should drive approximately $20 billion in revenue growth by 2015: 
1. Growth Markets. Revenue for our Growth Markets Unit was up 11 percent at constant currency for the second year in a row. Growth markets contributed 22 percent
of IBM’s geographic revenue in 2011, up from 11 percent in 2000, and we expect them to approach 30 percent by 2015. 
2. Business Analytics. Our analytics business grew
16 percent for the year. Having spotted early the emergence of “big data,” IBM built the world’s leading 
analytics software and consulting practice, and we are translating it into powerful new capabilities, which enable our clients to identify, manage and even predict outcomes that matter to their success. 
3. Cloud. IBM has helped thousands of clients adopt aspects of cloud computing, where IT resources are virtualized, highly automated and accessed by self-service. Our cloud revenue in 2011 was more than three times 
the prior year. 
Our strong strategic positioning, solid balance sheet, recurring revenue, robust profit streams and unmatched global 
reach give us confidence that we will achieve success in
the next five years, as we have during the past decade. 
4. Smarter Planet. All of this comes together in our solutions to build Smarter Planet systems, transforming systems such as supply chains, retail, energy, transportation, telecommunications, food and water. It includes the successful establishment of large new market categories, such as Smarter Cities and Smarter Commerce. Smarter Planet revenue grew by almost 50 percent in 2011. 
In sum, our strong strategic positioning, solid balance sheet, recurring revenue, robust profit streams and unmatched global reach give us confidence that we will achieve success in the next five years, as we have during the past decade. The information on pages 9 to 15 —“Generating Higher 
Value at IBM”—explains how. 
The decade ahead 
The next decade holds enormous promise for IBM,
most importantly because of what it holds for business and society at large. We are uniquely positioned to deliver the benefits of a vast new natural resource —a gusher
of data from both man-made and natural systems that can now be tapped to help businesses and institutions succeed in an increasingly complex and dynamic global economy. Together, we can create economic and societal value of incalculable potential, across the developed
and developing worlds, as well as in new global markets such as those in Africa. 
Without question, the world is undergoing disruption. But IBM now stands out among our industry peers
and in business at large as distinctively able to keep moving to the future, and to keep generating differentiating 
value for our clients, our employees and the citizens of the world. And that, in turn, promises to continue generating high value for our owners. 
The fact that we enter IBM’s second century with such strength and confidence is a testament to the extraordinary leadership of Sam Palmisano as IBM’s CEO. I will leave
to Sam the description of our historic transformation. 
But there is no doubt that IBM today is far stronger than it was a decade ago, in both its performance and its impact on the world. 
Let me close by expressing my pride in the worldwide IBM team for bringing us to this point, and my gratitude to you, our shareholders, for your unwavering support.
I trust you share our excitement about your company’s performance and the way in which IBMers are building on our storied past to build an even brighter future.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2012,"I am pleased to report that in 2012, IBM achieved record operating earnings per share, record free cash flow and record profit margins, with revenues that were flat at constant currency. Operating earnings per share were up 13 percent, putting us well on track to our 2015 Road Map objective of at least $20 of operating earnings per share. Importantly, we continued to deliver value to you, our owners. This performance is a testament to our strategic position and capabilities, the discipline of our management systems, and the dedication and expertise of more than 430,000 IBMers around the world. Importantly, it reflects the impact of a distinct choice we have made about IBM’s business and technology model. IBM is an innovation company. Both in what we do and in how we do it, we pursue continuous transformation— always remixing to higher value in our portfolio and skills, in the capabilities we deliver to our clients and in our own operations and management practices. This is not the only path to success in our industry, and it is not the easiest one. But it is ours. In this letter, I will report on our 2012 results, and then put them in context of our model of continuous transformation. Results in 2012 Earnings per share: Diluted operating earnings per share in 2012 were $15.25, a new record. This marked 10 straight years of double-digit EPS growth. Margins: IBM’s operating pre-tax income margin rose for the 10th consecutive year—to 22.2 percent, up 12 points since 2000. Cash flow: IBM has consistently generated strong cash flow, a key indicator of real business performance. In 2012 our free cash flow was $18.2 billion, a record for IBM and $12 billion higher than a decade ago. We ended 2012 with $11.1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Revenue and income: Our revenue in 2012 was $104.5 billion, down 2 percent as reported and flat at constant currency. We grew operating net income by 8 percent, to $17.6 billion, our highest ever. Investment and return to shareholders:In 2012 we invested $3.7 billion for 11 acquisitions in key areas of software and services; $4.3 billion in net capital expenditures; and $6.3 billion in R&D. We were able to return $15.8 billion to you—$12 billion through share repurchases and $3.8 billion through dividends. Last year’s dividend increase was 13 percent, marking the 17th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend, and the 97th consecutive year in which we have paid one. Since 2000, we have added $14.6 billion to IBM’s operating pre-tax profit base, and increased our pre-tax income 1.7 times, our operating earnings per share 3.6 times and our free cash flow 1.7 times. Cumulatively, we have generated about $150 billion of free cash flow. IBM’s Model: Continuous Transformation In an industry characterized by a relentless cycle of innovation and commoditization, one model for success is that of the commodity player—winning through low 
price, efficiency and economies of scale. Ours is a different choice: the path of innovation, reinvention and shift to higher value. We remix to higher value:We do so in our portfolio, in our organic R&D investment, and through targeted acquisitions and divestitures. • We remix our research and development: Two decades ago, 70 percent of our researchers were working in materials science, hardware and related technology. Even the one-in-ten working in software were focused on operating systems and compilers.Today, 60 percent are in fields that support our key growth initiatives, such as the 400 mathematicians developing algorithms for business analytics, as well as a diverse group of specialists that include medical doctors, computational biologists, experts in natural language processing, and weather and climate forecasters. Since the beginning of 2010, we have spent $19 billion on R&D, and in 2012 IBM earned the most U.S. patents for the 20th straight year, with a record total of 6,478. • We acquire new capabilities: Organizations run into trouble when they look to fulfill a new strategy or provide the basis for transformation through acquisitions. We practice a disciplined approach that asks three questions: Does it build on or extend a capability IBM already has? Does the company have scalable intellectual property? Can it take advantage of our reach into 170 countries? Our balanced formula has built a strong track record since 2000, with more than 140 acquisitions. • We divest nonstrategic assets: Always moving to the future isn’t just about what you invent. It also involves choices about when to move on. Over the past decade we have divested almost $15 billion of annual revenue— businesses that no longer fit our strategy. If we had not done so, we would be a larger company today, but with lower margins and capabilities less essential to our clients.
We make markets: We create new markets by category, by geography and by client. • We make markets by category: Our software and services businesses today look very different from just a few years ago, offering new solution categories like MobileFirst, Social Business and Smarter Commerce. In our hardware business, momentum is building for our new PureSystems family, which launched the new category of workload-optimized systems. PureSystems has seen more than 2,300 installations in more than 70 countries in just two quarters. • We make markets by geography: We are achieving strong results in the world’s growth markets, working closely with businesses, institutions and governments as they seek to modernize their infrastructures and societies. We opened 144 new branches in these markets in 2012. We also continue remixing to more profitable opportunities in these countries, through Smarter Planet solutions such as Smarter Transportation, Smarter Finance and Smarter Cities.
• We make markets by client: We unlock new opportunity within our existing client base by creating capabilities for a new generation of IT buyers—from chief marketing officer to chief financial officer to the head of human resources and more. I discuss this in greater depth below. We reinvent core franchises: Our System z enterprise server, introduced in 2012, is just the latest reinvention of the mainframe, and it drove System z’s largest capacity shipment ever during the fourth quarter— with more than half of that growth coming from Linux workloads. Core software platforms such as WebSphere have been entirely transformed. And Information Technology Services, which was once a significant reseller of others’ technology—generating good revenue but low margins— has shifted significantly to high-value services such as data center energy efficiency, security, and business continuity and recovery. This has contributed to a 6-point pre-tax income margin improvement in services since 2000. We remix our skills and expertise: An innovation model means continuously remixing and deepening our expertise. For example, over the past three years we have increased our skill base in analytics by more than 8,100 experts. We have also added nearly 9,500 sellers in key areas of industry expertise— such as healthcare, energy, telecom and banking, as well as emerging sectors such as metals and mining. This year, IBM Global Business Services and IBM Research will launch the IBM Client Experience Lab, as well as joint GBS and Software practices in social business and mobility— including a tripling of our skill base in social and mobile technologies and doubling our skill base in Smarter Commerce. We reinvent the enterprise itself:We have been highly disciplined about driving productivity—through the adoption of common, shared operations and systems; the streamlining of enterprise-wide processes; and the leveraging of global skills—all in the service of global integration. And we are now taking the next step, becoming a Smarter Enterprise: • In part, this means applying analytics to every part of our business—changing how we manage risk, drive efficiency, increase marketing effectiveness and infuse business insight across the company. • In part, it means using social technologies to identify IBM experts and enable them to deliver their knowledge and leverage our entire portfolio to create a seamless, high-value client experience. This ongoing transformation gives us confidence that we will achieve our goal of $8 billion in productivity savings over the course of our 2015 Road Map. Sixty percent of our productivity savings are reinvested in the business. 
We use our strong cash flow strategically: Our cash flow generation fuels reinvestment in the business— in R&D, capital expenditures and acquisitions. At the same time, we deliver consistently strong returns to you, our owners.
A New Era of Computing To sustain an innovation model in our industry, a company must do more than accommodate major technology shifts. It must lead them. IBM has done this repeatedly over the past century—not only pioneering new technology models, but capturing significant economic value. Today, another new wave is sweeping in—powered by Big Data, analytics, mobile, social and cloud. We anticipated this several years ago with our point of view on building a Smarter Planet—a world that was becoming instrumented, interconnected and intelligent. Now, the IT environment is moving from monolithic applications to dynamic services; from structured data at rest to unstructured data in motion; from PCs to unprecedented numbers and kinds of devices; from stable to unpredictable workloads; from static infrastructure to cloud services; and from proprietary standards to open innovation. This shift plays strongly to IBM’s historic position in enterprise computing. So we are, as we have so often done in the past, reshaping our investment, innovation and market strategies to lead. We see three defining characteristics of this new era— what we call Smarter Computing: 1. Smarter Computing is designed for Big Data. Every two days, as much data is now generated as in all of human history up to 2003. This is “Big Data,” and it constitutes a vast new natural resource that can revolutionize industries and societies— with the right technology, capable of analyzing and extracting value and insight from it. This is one reason IBM’s analytics business is growing so strongly, as we work with clients to drive intelligence into every aspect of their operations. Indeed, we have raised our 2015 Road Map target for Business Analytics from $16 billion to $20 billion of revenue. We are also rapidly advancing the marketplace applications for our breakthrough “cognitive” computing system, Watson, which is already demonstrating its potential to transform healthcare and finance. We will introduce our first commercial Watson offerings this year. To sustain an innovation model in our industry, a company must do more than accommodate major technology shifts. 2. Smarter Computing is built on software-defined environments. To handle today’s volume, velocity and variety of data, enterprise data centers must become more dynamic and flexible. One way to think about this is to imagine entire IT infrastructures that are as programmable as individual systems. This new model is known as the “software-defined environment,” and cloud computing is its first manifestation. However, it will not be the last. This new model optimizes the entire computing “stack”—compute, storage and network resources—so that it can adapt to the type of work required. Hardware built for these new environments will be of significant business value— exemplified by IBM’s systems today. From System z, to Power Systems, to storage, to our new PureSystems family, IBM systems are software-defined. 
3. Smarter Computing is open. Only through open standards and platforms can enterprises support an expanding universe of heterogeneous data, devices and services, and engage in today’s rich innovation ecosystems. The challenge is how to turn open approaches into successful business. IBM helped do so with Linux, Eclipse and Apache, supporting their growth into standards with vital industry ecosystems, and then developing highvalue IBM business on top of them. Today, we are repeating this strategy through a number of collaborations such as OpenStack, a new open source cloud platform; Hadoop, an open source platform for Big Data; and several promising open source hardware projects. Taken together, computing that is open, softwaredefined, and designed for Big Data constitutes a profound shift in information technology. And as in prior such shifts, it will create new markets and new clients. We are pursuing them aggressively. New Clients, New Markets As I mentioned, to capture the opportunities opened up by this new era of technology, IBM is engaging with new kinds of clients as we make new markets in Big Data/analytics, cloud for the enterprise, emerging economies and Smarter Planet. Indeed, from a business perspective, Smarter Planet is a platform for a growing array of new markets—such as Smarter Commerce, Smarter Cities and Social Business— and these new markets take concrete shape through the engagement and enablement of a new generation of IT clients. Today, we are working around the world and across multiple industries with many new leaders. Perhaps the most active among them in embracing the new era of technology have been chief marketing officers, who are looking to reinvent the practice of marketing— for example, by understanding and enabling customers as individuals, rather than “segments.” This helped our Global Business Services Smarter Commerce signings grow by nearly 200 percent in 2012—reaching $2 billion. At the same time, chief procurement officers are expected to increase their annual investment in Supplier Intelligence by 30 percent through 2015, as they reshape their global supply chains. And leaders of human resources are investing in analytics to build smarter workforces and social enterprises. One analyst has ranked IBM as number one in enterprise social business for the past three years. “Front-office” transformation has the potential to fuel the biggest wave of business technology investment since the era of enterprise resource planning. City mayors are deploying Intelligent Operations Centers to transform public services in Davao, Philippines; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Miami-Dade County, Florida. And urban transportation managers, such as those in Singapore and Eindhoven, Netherlands, are reducing urban congestion by offering drivers alternate route recommendations in exchange for their cars’ data on braking, acceleration and location. This list could go on. “Front-office” transformation has the potential to fuel the biggest wave of business technology investment since the era of enterprise resource planning (ERP). And that creates a powerful set of conditions for the tens of thousands of business advisors and industry experts embedded in the world’s greatest engine of technical innovation. In sum, our strong strategic positioning, solid balance sheet, recurring revenue, robust profit streams, global reach— and especially our institutional capacity for innovation and continuous transformation—give us confidence that we will continue to provide differentiating value to our clients, employees, partners and communities—and therefore to you, our owners. “Generating Higher Value at IBM” (pp. 8–15) summarizes how. On Being Essential In closing, let me say a few words on the deeper meaning of this model of continuous transformation to higher value, at this particular moment in history. As I have noted, an innovation model does not present an easy path, especially in an industry as fast-changing as ours. But once you are clear on your choice, it shapes everything you do: your business strategy, how you recruit talent, how you develop skills, how you invent, how you run the company. And for IBM, it means something more. It speaks to IBMers’ aspiration to be essential to each of our vital constituencies— our clients, our communities, our partners, our investors, and one another. We see this as our purpose as an enterprise— to serve their plans for success, their need to transform and their own unique sense of purpose. 
The era opening before us offers a historic opportunity for both businesses and societies to pursue this higher purpose. A vast new natural resource is being unleashed— promising to do for our century what steam, electricity and fossil fuels did for the Industrial Age. The economic and societal potential of this new gusher of data is incalculable. It is the opportunity of our lifetime— and IBMers are determined to seize it. It is in this spirit that I express my deep pride in the worldwide IBM team for bringing us to where we are, and my gratitude to you, our shareholders, for your unwavering support. I hope you share our excitement about your company’s performance and the way in which IBMers are building a smarter planet and a brighter future.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2013,"Dear IBM Investor: What will we make of this moment—as businesses, as individuals, as societies? What will we make with a planet generating unprecedented amounts of data? What will we create from—and with—global networks of consumers, workers, citizens, students, patients? How will we make use of powerful business and technology services available on demand? How will we engage with an emerging global culture, defined not by age or geography, but by people determined to change the practices of business and society? To capture the potential of this moment, IBM is executing a bold agenda. It is reshaping your company, and we believe it will reshape our industry. In this letter I will describe the actions we have taken and are taking, and the changed company that is emerging from this transformation. I believe that if you understand our strategy, you will share our confidence in IBM’s prospects—for the near term, for this decade and beyond. Let’s start with the phenomenon of our age—data.
A planet of data Today, every discussion about changes in technology, business and society must begin with data. In its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, data is becoming a new natural resource. It promises to be for the 21st century what steam power was for the 18th, electricity for the 19th and hydrocarbons for the 20th. This is what we mean by enterprises, institutions and our planet becoming smarter. Thanks to a proliferation of devices and the infusion of technology into all things and processes, the world is generating more than 2.5 billion gigabytes of data every day, and 80 percent of it is “unstructured”—everything from images, video and audio to social media and a blizzard of impulses from embedded sensors and distributed devices. This is the driver of IBM’s first strategic imperative: To make markets by transforming industries and professions with data. The market for data and analytics is estimated at $187 billion by 2015. To capture this growth potential, we have built the world’s broadest and deepest capabilities in Big Data and analytics—both technology and expertise. We have invested more than $24 billion, including $17 billion of gross spend on more than 30 acquisitions. We have 15,000 consultants and 400 mathematicians. Twothirds of IBM Research’s work is now devoted to data, analytics and cognitive computing. IBM has earned 4,000 analytics patents. We have an ecosystem of 6,000 industry partners and 1,000 university partnerships around the world developing new, analytics-related curricula. IBM provides the full array of capabilities our clients need to extract the value of Big Data. They can mine multiple structured and unstructured data sets across their business. They can apply a range of analytics—from descriptive to predictive to prescriptive. And importantly, they can capture the time value of data. This matters, because the battle for competitive advantage in this new world can be lost or won in fractions of a second. Our data and analytics portfolio today is the deepest in the industry. It includes decision management, content analytics, planning and forecasting, discovery and exploration, business intelligence, predictive analytics, data and content management, stream computing, data warehousing, information integration and governance. This portfolio provides the basis for the next major era in computing—cognitive systems. Traditional computing systems, which only do what they are programmed to do, simply cannot keep up with Big Data in constant motion. For that, we need a new paradigm. These new systems are not programmed; rather, they learn, from the vast quantities of information they ingest, from their own experiences, and from their interactions with people. IBM launched this era three years ago, when our Watson system defeated the two all-time champions on the quiz show Jeopardy! Watson has since matured from a research grand challenge into a multifaceted business platform, enabled globally via the cloud. Earlier this year we launched the IBM Watson Group. It will comprise 2,000 professionals, a $1 billion investment and an ecosystem of partners and developers that we expect to scale rapidly. In the process, we believe Watson will change the nature of computing, as it is already beginning to change the practice of healthcare, retail, travel, banking and more. Taken together, our investments in data and analytics are driving significant growth, with 40,000 service engagements to date, growing by double digits. In 2013 our business analytics revenue rose 9 percent—led by Global Business Services and Software. This is already a nearly $16 billion business for us, and we have raised our expectations for it. An IT industry remade by cloud At the same time that industries and professions are being remade by data, the information technology infrastructure of the world is being transformed by the emergence of cloud computing—that is, the delivery of IT and business processes as digital services. It is estimated that by 2016, more than one-fourth of the world’s applications will be available in the cloud, and 85 percent of new software is now being built for cloud. This is driving IBM’s second strategic imperative: To remake enterprise IT infrastructure for the era of cloud. As important as cloud is, its economic significance is often misunderstood. That lies less in the technology, which is relatively straightforward, than in the new business models cloud will enable for enterprises and institutions. This is creating a market that is expected to reach $250 billion by 2015. IBM today is the leader in enterprise cloud, a position we have enhanced through investments of $7 billion on 15 acquisitions, most notably SoftLayer in 2013. We provide the full spectrum of cloud delivery models—infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service and business process as a service. IBM’s cloud capabilities are built on 1,500 cloud patents and supported by thousands of cloud experts. Eighty percent of Fortune 500 companies use IBM’s cloud capabilities. Our cloud foundation at the infrastructure level is SoftLayer, the market’s premier public and private cloud environment, with “bare metal” dedicated servers that provide unmatched compute power, deployed in real time, with hundreds of configuration options. Our public cloud processes 5.5 million client transactions every day. In terms of technology, security, flexibility and pricing, IBM surpasses all our major competitors. And our rapidly growing roster of 30,000 client engagements—including companies like Honda, Sun Life Stadium, US Open Tennis and hundreds of top online games with a user base exceeding 100 million—is a testament to that. These companies and a growing number of others understand that their customer-facing applications—which they deploy on public clouds for reasons of cost, accessibility and speed—must be integrated with their core enterprise systems—such as finance, inventory, manufacturing and human resources. This is why one analyst predicts that by 2017, nearly 50 percent of large enterprises will use hybrid cloud environments that are part public, part private and integrated with back-end systems. It is also why a new class of “cloud middleware services” is emerging to manage these complex environments. Last month we announced several capabilities that will connect enterprise data and applications to the cloud. IBM’s entire enterprise software portfolio is becoming available to developers in an open, composable business environment to build applications with flexibility and scalability. A “cloud first” approach is being implemented in IBM software development labs globally. For line-of-business users looking to drive innovation—including heads of finance, marketing, human resources, procurement and other functions—we offer an unmatched array of more than 100 software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. IBM’s SaaS offerings today support 24 of the top 25 companies in the Fortune 500. Going forward, companies will continue to unlock the value of these business applications. For example, nearly 70 percent of organizations are currently using or planning to use composable business services. Finally, enterprises will want—and need—to manage their data in the cloud with the same rigor as if it were on-premises. Companies will do this in order to ensure auditability, visibility, change control, access control and data loss protection. Indeed, data management will arguably be the single most important design point for enterprise cloud environments, driven not only by security and cost, but also by regulation. To meet growing demand for greater speed, and legal requirements for compliance and data residency, IBM is aggressively expanding its global cloud footprint. We currently have 25 data centers globally, and the new $1.2 billion investment announced in January will see the opening of 15 more, in the US, the UK, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan and Mexico. The impact of our cloud investments shows up clearly in our results. IBM’s cloud business grew 69 percent in 2013, delivering $4.4 billion of revenue. As we actively embrace cloud in order to deliver “IBM as a Service” to our clients, we expect to see significant benefits in client experience, revenue growth and enterprise productivity. Engagement in a world of empowered individuals The phenomena of data and cloud are changing the arena of global business and society. At the same time, proliferating mobile technology and the spread of social business are empowering people with knowledge, enriching them through networks and changing their expectations. This leads to IBM’s third strategic imperative: To enable “systems of engagement” for enterprises. 
Complementing traditional back-office systems of record, enterprises are now taking a systematic approach to engagement with all of their constituencies—customers, employees, partners, investors and citizens. Indeed, 57 percent of companies now expect to devote more than a quarter of their IT spending to these new systems of engagement by 2016, nearly twice the level of 12 months ago. They are doing so because the way their customers and their own workers expect to engage is undergoing profound change. Seventy percent of people who contact a company via social media today expect a response within five minutes. Nearly 80 percent of adult smartphone users keep their phones with them an average of 22 hours a day. This is why we launched IBM MobileFirst in 2013, and why we have made eight acquisitions to advance our mobile initiatives. We have 3,000 mobile experts, and have been awarded hundreds of patents in mobile and wireless technologies. When these individuals use their mobile devices to engage with a company, they expect personalized service. Indeed, 80 percent of people are willing to trade their information for a customized offering. The good news is that this is increasingly possible, thanks to social business and data analytics. But it’s not that simple. One only needs to follow the news to see rapidly rising concerns— legitimate concerns—about data security and institutional trust. Two-thirds of US adults say they would not return to a business that lost their confidential information. And the economic stakes are enormous. One analyst estimates that by 2016, there could be an additional $1 trillion of growth in global online retail—if the industry can enhance trust. We have strengthened our already clear leadership in enterpriseclass social business and in security. Our acquisitions in social include Kenexa, which helps companies use behavioral science not just to connect with people, but to understand and build lasting engagement with them. And we have made a dozen acquisitions in security, building a capability of more than 6,000 security experts, 3,000 patents and 25 labs worldwide. Finally, IBM is leading by example in building modern enterprise systems of engagement and learning. Our social platform, Connections, has 300,000 IBM users and 200,000 communities. There are more than 30,000 IBMers active on Client Collaboration Hubs for our top 300 accounts. Last year, hundreds of thousands of IBMers worldwide shaped the practices that define how we work. And they are enhancing their skills daily through a massive open online learning system called THINK Academy. In 2013, we achieved year-over-year growth of 69 percent in mobile, 19 percent in security and 45 percent in social business. Our performance in 2013 You can learn more about the IBM Strategy on pp. 10–23. This is the context in terms of which to understand our performance in 2013. By many measures, it was a successful year for IBM. Our diluted operating earnings per share in 2013 were $16.28, a new record. This marked 11 straight years of operating EPS growth. We grew operating net income by 2 percent, to $18 billion. In 2013 we invested $3.1 billion for 10 acquisitions. We invested $3.8 billion in net capital expenditures. We invested $6.2 billion in R&D, while earning the most US patents for the 21st straight year. 
While making all these investments in IBM’s future capabilities, we were able to return $17.9 billion to you in 2013—approximately $13.9 billion through gross share repurchases and $4.1 billion through dividends. Last year’s dividend increase was 12 percent, marking the 18th year in a row in which we have raised our dividend, and the 98th consecutive year in which we have paid one. However, we must acknowledge that while 2013 was an important year of transformation, our performance did not meet our expectations. Our operating pre-tax income was down 8 percent. Our revenue in 2013, at $99.8 billion, was down 5 percent as reported and 2 percent at constant currency. So, while we continue to remix to higher value, we must also address those parts of our business that are holding us back. We have two specific challenges, and we are taking steps to address both. The first involves shifting the IBM hardware business for new realities and opportunities. We are accelerating the move of our Systems product portfolio—in particular, Power and storage—to growth opportunities and to Linux, following the lead of our successful mainframe business. The modern demands of Big Data, cloud and mobile require enterprisestrength computing, and no other company can match IBM’s ongoing capabilities and commitment to developing those essential technologies. We also announced, in January, an agreement to sell much of our Intel-based x86 server business to Lenovo. This divestiture is consistent with our continuing strategy of exiting lowermargin businesses, such as PCs, hard-disk drives and retail store solutions. But let me be clear—we are not exiting hardware. 
IBM will remain a leader in high-performance and high-end systems, storage and cognitive computing, and we will continue to invest in R&D for advanced semiconductor technology. The second challenge involves the world’s growth markets. While IBM’s growth in Latin America and Middle East and Africa was strong, enterprise spending slowed in other key growth markets. We are intensifying focus on new growth opportunities. Overall, the opportunity in the world’s growth markets remains attractive. On being essential As we have learned throughout our history, the key to success is getting the big things right, innovating and investing accordingly, and challenging our organization, operations and especially our culture to adapt. When you do all those things, you do more than stay abreast of change. You lead it. You invent entirely new capabilities— such as cognitive computing and Watson. You translate these innovations into sustainable economic value—such as building cloud infrastructure that is enterprise-class and societally robust. And you make yourself a laboratory for the future—of work, of engagement, of the modern enterprise. The progress we are making on these strategic imperatives is highly encouraging. No company in our industry is positioned as strongly as 103-year-old IBM for the world now taking shape. We are confident in our vision, our strategy and our prospects. Every generation of IBMers has the opportunity—and, I believe, the responsibility—to invent a new IBM. This is our time. We are working to make this not just a successful business, but an essential institution for our clients and the world in a new era. 
I am deeply proud of the global IBM team for bringing us here, and I am grateful to you, our shareholders, for your unwavering support. I hope you share our excitement about your company’s path and the shared opportunity we have, together, to build a brighter future on a smarter planet.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2014,"Dear IBM Investor: The cover of our report to you last year asked: “What will we make of this moment?” This was the critical and urgent decision that we—and our clients—faced. Would we seize upon the major shifts that are reordering our industry and opening up vast new applications of information technology? In my letter, I described our answer: • IBM would help transform industries and professions with data. • We would remake enterprise IT for the era of cloud. • We would reimagine work by helping clients build systems of engagement, underpinned by the imperative of security. At the same time, we would address significant challenges in some of our businesses, principally hardware. We knew we faced a critical year of transformation. It proved to be just that. The work of transforming IBM continues, and much remains to be done. But I am pleased to report that we made significant progress and built momentum in 2014. In this letter I will describe what we have done, and continue to do, to transform and differentiate your company and to position ourselves for leadership in the new era now taking shape. 
Continuing to move to higher value Information technology is one of the most dynamic, fastchanging and fiercely competitive industries in the world, characterized by relentless cycles of innovation and commoditization. Our choice is clear: We pursue a model of high-value innovation, rather than commodity technology, products and services. Our commitment to this model compels us to reinvent businesses continually; grow new ones organically and through acquisitions; and occasionally divest businesses that do not fit our profile. You see all of this reflected in our 2014 results—a dynamic shift of our portfolio underneath our $92.8 billion in revenue, $21 billion in operating pre-tax income and operating earnings per share of $16.53 from continuing operations. Consider that we completed or announced the divestiture of three businesses in 2014 that a year earlier drove $7 billion in revenue, but lost about $500 million in profit— what I call “empty calories.” At the same time, we are making significant investments in line with the strategy I described to you last year. Throughout the year you saw the bold moves we made: • $1 billion to accelerate the commercialization of IBM Watson, bringing cognitive computing to more clients and partners in more industries. • $1.2 billion to expand our SoftLayer cloud centers around the world. We expect to have 46 locations by the end of 2015. • $1 billion to create IBM Bluemix, our cloud platform-asa-service for software developers. • Further scaling our global IBM Cloud business through partnerships with SAP and Tencent.
IBM Watson Analytics, offering powerful cognitive and visually intuitive analytics in the palm of your hand. • A landmark partnership with Apple to bring mobility to the enterprise and reimagine the work of professionals. • A strategic alliance with Twitter to bring an entire new category of Big Data to business. These investments will contribute to the strong growth we are seeing in our strategic imperatives, which deliver high value and now represent a significant part of IBM. Together, cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security generated $25 billion of revenue in 2014, growing by 16 percent. Five years ago, these businesses represented just 13 percent of our revenue. Today, that has risen to 27 percent of IBM’s revenue. Big Data and analytics. Our analytics business grew 7 percent to $17 billion in 2014. We are driving growth by helping our clients integrate all data sources—structured and unstructured—and apply a range of analytics— descriptive, predictive and prescriptive. We combine this capability with deep knowledge of industries and professions. Our analytics portfolio draws upon more than 30 acquisitions and includes nine Analytics Solutions Centers with an ecosystem of more than 6,000 business partners. Further, we are creating the next stage of Big Data and analytics with cognitive computing. Cloud. Our cloud business is growing rapidly—up 60 percent to $7 billion in 2014, with “as-a-service” at $3 billion, up nearly 80 percent and exiting the year with a run rate of $3.5 billion. IBM Cloud is set apart by focusing on hybrid environments optimized for data and security, shaped by our knowledge of the requirements of enterprise clients. For example, the planetwide footprint of cloud centers that we are building will provide clients the combination of global and localized data access and security that they need. This is unmatched in the industry. Engagement, underpinned by security. In mobile, our growth more than tripled in 2014. Going forward, we expect this to benefit from the apps from our strategic alliance with Apple and our global network of digital design studios. Further, IBM is the global leader in enterprise security, grounded not only in technology and our 3,700 patents, but in our experience-based understanding of the changing nature of the challenge. Enterprises and institutions discover that they cannot wall out attackers. Twenty-first century security is a Big Data problem— which is why our security business, with unequalled data and analytics capability, grew 19 percent in 2014. At the same time that we have been growing new businesses, we have been reinventing our core franchises. Last year we promised to address challenges in our Systems and Technology business. We did so in 2014, with hardware going from losses in the first half to nearly $400 million of profit in the fourth quarter alone. That is a remarkable swing. In transforming this business, we took several important actions: • We sold our x86 server business and announced the divestiture of our commercial semiconductor technology business. • We committed $3 billion over the next five years to the development of next-generation semiconductor technologies.
We introduced major technological advances with POWER8 and software defined storage—built for cloud and Big Data. • In January 2015 we launched our new z13 mainframe. Built for the mobile era, it processes massive volumes of transactions while tapping back-office data and simultaneously applying real-time analytics for deeper insights and fraud detection. • Historically, we kept our industry-leading Power technology all to ourselves. Today, we see greater value by enabling an OpenPOWER ecosystem, which allows partners to innovate and build on the Power technology. Launched in 2013, the OpenPOWER Foundation began with five members and now stands at more than 100 around the world. The U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded IBM a long-term, $325 million contract to create future supercomputers based on OpenPOWER technology. All of this speaks to the enduring quality of IBM as a highvalue innovation company. Last year we again spent about 6 percent of our revenue on research and development— and the ratio within our software business is double that. We invested $4 billion on capital expenditures. IBMers are prolific innovators. For the 22nd straight year, we earned the most U.S. patents of any organization, averaging 20 a day. 2015: Our transformation continues Our direction is clear. We remain confident in our strategy, and we have made much progress. In 2015 we will build on our momentum: 1. We will shift an additional $4 billion of spending to data, cloud and engagement this year, aimed at deepening our differentiation in the marketplace. In February we introduced innovations to make hybrid cloud a reality for the enterprise. We are also growing our portfolio of industry-specific analytics solutions in areas ranging from counter-fraud and oil and gas exploration, to airline maintenance and the Internet of Things. And we began the year by establishing a number of business units focused on markets and industries being transformed by our strategic imperatives: IBM Commerce, IBM Analytics, IBM Security and IBM Cloud. We have announced plans for an IBM Healthcare unit. 2. We will continue to bring innovation to our core franchises —innovation highly valued by our clients. I previously mentioned the entirely refreshed line of mainframes, IBM Power Systems and storage. We will continue to apply breakthroughs from IBM Research to our products and services. In software, we will accelerate our march to “as-a-service.” In services, we will deploy advanced automation to delivery. And we will continue helping new and existing outsourcing clients transform their infrastructure and processes by leveraging IBM’s hybrid cloud platform. This was an important differentiator in helping us to sign nearly 50 contracts worth greater 
than $100 million in 2014 and to maintain a services backlog of $128 billion. These core franchises also provide the foundation for future innovation and growth. One example is our partnership with Apple. Together, we are placing powerful analytics capabilities in the hands of professionals. These apps are integrated with critical business systems, work flows and data sets. That’s what enables an airline attendant to rebook a flight while en route; a financial advisor to model a portfolio in the client’s living room; an in-store sales assistant to act as a trusted fashion advisor; or an emergency responder to have real-time situation-risk awareness, including live video. 3. We believe open ecosystems and partnerships are key to our future innovation. This is a significant new element of our growth strategy. We will add to and scale partnerships with companies like Apple, Twitter, SAP, Tencent and now, SoftBank. Also, the IBM Watson Ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with 4,000 companies in the pipeline. Together, these actions will make IBM an even higher-value business. We expect our strategic imperatives of cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security to continue growing by double digits and to become a greater percentage of IBM. We will remain the enterprise leader in these markets. Finally, we will continue to return substantial value to you, our owners, through dividends and gross share repurchases. Last year, these were $4.3 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. In 2014 we marked our 19th consecutive year of raising our dividend and our 99th year of paying one.
An essential company So I come back to this moment, full of rapid change, but even more opportunity — and to IBM’s unique purpose as an enterprise. IBM lives at the intersection of technology and business. This enables us to change the way the world works, and in so doing, to be essential to our clients and to society. We work with 90 percent of the world’s top banks, 9 of the top 10 oil and gas companies, 40 of the top 50 retailers and 92 of the top 100 healthcare organizations. IBM systems manage banking, reservations, transportation, retail, trading and healthcare systems. Our mainframes alone process 75 percent of the world’s business data. Today we are building upon this foundation to create an entirely new generation of critical systems. IBM’s clients are unclogging city traffi c, exploring a cure for cancer, improving the safety of food supplies, reducing risk, and serving their own customers, employees, citizens and patients with greater levels of understanding, personalization and intimacy. A new world is taking shape before our eyes, remade by data, rewritten in code and growing smarter every day. This is the work that energizes me and all of my fellow IBMers. I am deeply grateful to the IBM team for bringing us here, and to you, our shareholders, for your support. I hope you share our excitement about your company’s path and the shared opportunity we have, together, to do something that is truly essential. 
"
IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2015," IBM is unique. It is the only company in our industry that has reinvented itself through multiple technology eras and economic cycles. We do so for one reason: to create differentiating value for our clients and for you, our owners. 
We are doing so again, in an IT industry that is fundamentally reordering at an unprecedented pace.
In important ways, our industry is unrecognizable from what it looked like just a few years ago. So is your company. Today, IBM is much more than a “hardware, software, services” company. IBM is now emerging as a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. 
In this year’s report, I will share my perspective on what this means to you and
to our clients around the world. I will discuss our results from 2015 and what we expect
to achieve this year and beyond. Although more must be done and the work of transformation is never complete, I believe we have reached a turning point in our journey. 
The Progress of Our Transformation 
Two years ago, we laid out our strategic plan
to transform IBM, in order to ensure that we meet the changing needs of our clients and capture the highest-value opportunities for our investors. As part of this, we divested commoditizing businesses that provided diminishing value
to our clients and contributed revenue but little or no profit. We restructured other businesses, of which hardware was the largest—businesses vital to our future but in need of reinvention.
At the same time, we dramatically accelerated the growth of our strategic imperatives—
Data and Analytics, Cloud, Mobile, Social and Security—to help our clients become “digital.” 
Then last year, we launched integrated units to make it easier and quicker to put together solutions drawn from our expanding digital portfolio, further accelerating growth and enhancing client experience. We shifted more than $5 billion of investment to add fuel to our strategic imperatives, and in 2015 these businesses delivered solid growth, contributing 35 percent of IBM’s total revenue, up signifi- cantly from 22 percent two years ago. 
Now, in 2016, we have reached a new stage in our transformation. As important
as “becoming digital” is to our clients, it
has become clear that it is not the destination. Rather, digital business is converging with
a new kind of digital intelligence—what you will recognize as Watson. We call this Cognitive Business. In October we launched a global conversation about this new era of business and technology. 
Cognitive Business simultaneously speaks to clients about the coming era and explains the IBM that is now emerging. Let me describe it in greater depth. 
Our Solutions Are Cognitive Data is the world’s new natural resource, and it is transforming all industries and professions. IBM has been building and acquiring the capabilities necessary to lead in data and analytics, deepening our industry expertise and growing partnerships and ecosystems. Today, our data and analytics business is the industry leader, generating revenue of $18 billion in 2015. 
This is a strong and growing business— but its potential is actually much greater.
That potential lies in the 80 percent of the world’s data that is unstructured: everything we encode in language—from textbooks
and formulas to literature and conversation— plus all digital video, audio and images. This unstructured data has been essentially invisible to computers. They can capture, store and process it, but they cannot understand what it means. 
But with cognitive technology, we can now probe this “dark data.” Cognitive systems can ingest it all, and they can understand its meaning, through sensing and interaction. They can reason about it, generating hypotheses, arguments and recommendations. And unlike any computing system we have known, they are not programmed. Rather, they learn—from training by experts and from their own experience. In fact, they never stop learning. 
Cognitive includes—but is broader than— artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. And its embodiment
is Watson. 
Watson has come a long way since it won
on the American quiz show Jeopardy! in 2011. Back then, it did one thing: natural language Q&A, powered by five technologies. Today, Q&A is just one of more than 30 Watson capabilities— all of which have been turned into digital services, or application programming interfaces (APIs), delivered via the cloud. This means that we can literally build cognition into everything digital. With Watson, every digital application, product and process can understand, reason and learn. 
You can see why cognitive is becoming the heart of our solutions businesses. What started as one Watson unit is now a growing family:
the core Watson team, which continues to build new capabilities and nurture its expanding ecosystem; and individual Watson businesses, aimed at particular industries or professional domains, such as IBM Watson Health and
IBM Watson Internet of Things. Each business brings together Watson capabilities with industry expertise, vast data sets and an ecosystem
of partners and clients, and each is powered
by the IBM Cloud. 
In IBM Watson Health, for example, our partners include Medtronic, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the New York Genome Center and CVS Health. We have enhanced
our capabilities in healthcare with expertise and data sets acquired through population health management leader Phytel, health data analytics provider Explorys and medical images firm Merge Healthcare. In February 2016 we announced our intention to acquire Truven Health Analytics, a leading provider of cloud- based healthcare data, analytics and insights. And Watson is being trained by the world’s leading practitioners and researchers in multiple fields of life sciences, medicine and healthcare. 
Because these IBM Watson units will be
fed by an enormous new volume and variety of data, we have moved aggressively to expand our clients’ access to it, through partnerships with companies such as Twitter and Box and our acquisition of assets from The Weather Company. 
IBM Watson today is a rapidly expanding business, with clients in 36 countries, including leaders and start-ups in healthcare, financial services, retail, energy, automotive, government and more. And we continue to grow Watson’s capabilities—for example, giving it the capacity to “see” and expanding its natural language range beyond English—so far including Japanese, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and Arabic. 
OurPlatformIsCloud Inaworldbeingrewritten in code, coders are the new builders, and cloud is the platform on which they are building. All of our IBM Watson units, along with the rest of our growing portfolio of cognitive solutions, are being built on a cloud platform. 
The word “platform” is important. Much more than simply a faster and cheaper way
to access IT, a cloud platform is a new model
of innovation, manufacturing and distribution. Cloud platforms provide an open environment for collaboration and rapid scaling. They expose growing libraries of APIs from which partners and third parties across a broad ecosystem can create new, innovative solutions. And cloud offers access to multiple data sets and relevant expertise—not only about technology, but also from business and societal domains. 
The IBM Cloud is designed for this new era. It is the overall platform on which we, our clients and our ecosystem partners are building a rapidly expanding array of solutions.
It encompasses multiple technology and data platforms: 
• IBMBluemix,ourplatform-as-a-servicefor developers, was created by IBMers using Agile and Design Thinking approaches.
It has grown rapidly, ending the year onboard- ing 15,000 developers a week. And with more 
than120services,IBMBluemixisthelargest deployment of Cloud Foundry, an open source cloud application development platform. 
•	IBMSoftLayeristhecoreofourinfrastructure- as-a-service platform, which now consists
of 46 cloud data centers in every major market in the world. This business grew by double digits in 2015. 
•	The Weather Company is not just a source of enormously valuable weather data. It is
a platform, and it forms the heart of our new IBM Watson Internet of Things solutions unit. Today the platform can analyze data from 
3 billion weather forecast reference points, including satellites, weather stations, air- planes, consumer apps and more. It handles 26 billion inquiries to its cloud-based services each day in the United States alone, making it the country’s fourth most popular app. Going forward, we will apply this powerful platform to collect, integrate and analyze data from multiple sources, such as telematics in cars, sensors in buildings, readingsfromwearabledevicesanddata from smartphones, social media, supply chains and the environment. 
• Forourindustry-leadingIBMSecurity business, the IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform offers collaboration,
an app exchange and pertinent APIs. Our Security business also launched IBM X-Force Exchange, a cloud platform for more than 2,000 members across 16 industries to share threat data, with one of the world’s fullest catalogs of threat information, from more than 20 billion security events monitored daily. 
• InJanuary2016weannouncedIBMCloud Video Services, enhancing our substantial organic video capabilities with the acquisi- tions of Aspera, Cleversafe, Clearleap 
and, most recently, streaming video service Ustream. Like weather, video is one of the richest and fastest-growing data sources— expected to comprise 80 percent of Internet traffic by 2019. The market for cloud-based video services, analytics and software 
is estimated to be more than $100 billion by 2019, and we are now positioned for strong growth there. 
• Finally,Watsonitselfisacloudplatform, supporting a growing ecosystem. More than 80,000 developers are using Watson APIs, and more than 500 start-ups and businesses in the Watson ecosystem 
are building applications and solutions powered by Watson. 
Importantly, the future of cloud is hybrid, spanning public cloud, private cloud and the integration software, systems and services needed to bring these environments together securely and seamlessly. As enterprises move to the cloud, hybrid is not a transition phase; it is the destination. 
Indeed, it is the fastest-growing segment
of the cloud market, and IBM is the global leader in hybrid cloud for the enterprise. In this, our incumbency is a significant advantage—from processing and protecting nearly three-fourths of the world’s transactions on the IBM main- frame to designing and running core banking systems, supply chains, reservation and retail systems, and more. 
For example, we are bringing our large base of clients in IBM Global Technology Services (GTS) to the cloud. Last year, of our more than 70 services deals greater than $100 million, seven out of 10 featured hybrid cloud. 
We have also brought all of IBM’s relevant middleware into IBM Cloud. Our middleware
is the world’s leading IT integration platform, with one analyst firm naming us the middleware leader for the past 14 years. And middleware 
will be the heart of hybrid. IBM WebSphere, for example, unlocks all data and applications for the cloud. It enables clients’ existing apps to access the cloud and new “born on the cloud” applications to access existing assets. 
A final reason we will remain the global leader in enterprise cloud is that cloud’s future depends on infrastructure innovation. This is why the full spectrum of IBM Systems remains critical in this new era. We continue to design, develop and deliver leading-edge servers, storage and software built for a hybrid cloud world. For instance, our mainframe, reinvented for mobile transactions, serves as an advanced analytics accelerator and security-rich enterprise cloud server. And our Power platform is being used to deliver cognitive workloads through the rapidly growing OpenPOWER ecosystem and
a vibrant Linux community. 
Cognitive and cloud—many in our industry see these as two separate phenomena. We see them differently: as two sides of the same coin, two dimensions of a single model. Cognitive
is the only way to ingest and extract value from the new natural resource of data in all its forms, so that it can be turned into competitive advantage and societal value. And cloud is the platform on which these solutions are designed, built, tested and deployed in the world. 
2015 Performance 
The impact of our transformation is clear in our 2015 results. 
Our strategic imperatives—Analytics, Cloud, Mobile, Social and Security—grew by 26 percent and generated $29 billion last year. As I mention- ed, that represented 35 percent of IBM’s total revenue at year end. 
Adjusted for the impact of currency and divestitures (as are all revenue results
reported in this letter), Analytics revenue grew 16 percent for the year, to $18 billion. Mobile more than tripled for the second straight year. Security grew 12 percent. And Social was up
21 percent. Not only did total Cloud revenue increase by more than 50 percent, to $10 billion, making ours the largest cloud business in the world, but our cloud-delivered as-a-service revenue continued to grow, reaching $4.5 billion in 2015, with a year-end annual run rate of 
$5.3 billion.
Even as we fueled these high-growth 
businesses, we continued to bring innovation to the businesses our clients have long valued and relied on. 
IBM Global Technology Services, which
is increasingly injecting automation and cognition into our services delivery, grew both 
revenue and signings, finishing with a growing backlog. We have also grown in the parts
of IBM Global Business Services (GBS) where we have transitioned to our high-growth strategic imperatives, with nearly half of our GBS revenue now coming from those busi- nesses. In December we announced that our partnership with Apple had delivered more than 100 IBM MobileFirst for iOS applications, helping to transform the way work gets done across14industriesand65professions. 
Our Systems Hardware business had
a strong year. Since the launch of the z13
in the first quarter of 2015, we have delivered mainframe growth of 35 percent, with strong double-digit gains every quarter. Power revenue grew 4 percent in 2015 and has grown for
four straight quarters on the strength of OpenPOWER and Linux on Power. The strong performance of our Systems Hardware business over the past two years—swinging from a year-to-year decline in profit of $1.7 billion in 2013 to reporting profit growth of nearly $600 million last year—is largely the result of the significant business restructuring we
have implemented. 
For the full year, we generated revenue
of $81.7 billion, down 1 percent. We achieved operating earnings per share of $14.92 and delivered operating net income of $14.7 billion. 
The progress of our transformation—in particular our growth in hardware and GTS— shows what IBMers can do to reinvent
our core businesses. In 2016, we will focus on: 
• Oursoftwarebusinesses,wherewewill accelerate our shift to cognitive solution- based opportunities and help our
clients make the transition to as-a-service models delivered via hybrid cloud. 
• GBS,wherewewillusecognitivetodifferen- tiate and drive our consulting business; modernize GBS’s core business with digital value propositions; and grow margin through continued focus on high-value markets and improved productivity. 
• Storage,wherewewillaccelerateour shift to object storage and strengthen our leadership in flash. 
Our model is based on strong generation
of free cash flow, which we maintained with $13.1 billion in 2015. We use our cash to invest in the future and to return value to you, our owners. 
In 2015 we invested more than 6 percent of our revenue in R&D and about $4 billion in capital expenditures. We announced 15 acquisitions. And for the 23rd consecutive year, IBM led 
in U.S. patents earned, once again breaking
the 7,000 threshold. Even more important than the total number is the transformation those patents represent. Consider that when our streak began more than two decades ago, 27 percent of our patents were in hardware. Last year,
not only did we earn seven times as many total patents, but 31 percent of them were in cloud, analytics and cognitive. 
We also returned $9.5 billion to you in 2015, including dividends of nearly $5 billion and $4.6 billion in gross share repurchases. This marks the 20th consecutive year of an increased dividend, and IBM’s 100th straight year of providing one. 
The Emerging IBM 
Because IBM uniquely transforms both tech- nology and business, our own reinventions
in response to changing eras have been far- reaching. This is evident again today. As you have seen, we have transformed our portfolio— shedding businesses that provided little differ- entiating value to our clients, shifting our R&D and making dozens of acquisitions to fuel our growth businesses. At the same time, we have also injected new thinking and talent into IBM’s culture—such as training 60,000 IBMers in Agile methods and increasing our team 
of professional designers to more than 1,000, embedded with clients and in 23 design studios around the world. Both client satisfaction and employee engagement are on the rise. 
Our experience over multiple eras of techno- logical change has also taught us the importance of understanding its implications for the global economy, for society and for how all of us work and live. Today, some have expressed concerns about the impact of intelligent systems on
jobs and the future of work. These are legitimate questions, which must be addressed in a thoughtful manner across business, government and civil society. 
At IBM, our experience with cognitive systems —undertaking the deep science, learning what cognitive systems actually do and working every day to apply these capabilities in the world—has taught us that cognitive technology does not replace, but rather enhances, human capabilities. Instead of “artificial” intelligence, the real-world work of cognitive business is intelligence augmentation. And its benefits for the human condition will be extraordinary. 
In the end, the most important challenges we face are not about technology, but about values. Whether the question is civil liberties and national security; or privacy and conven- ience; or some professions rising while others decline, our path to this enormously hopeful future will depend on the creation of mutual value, transparency and, above all, trust. 
For IBM, 2015 was a pivotal year in our journey to this new era, providing strong confirmation
of the strategic direction of our transformation. We know who we are. We know why our clients seek to work with us. We know why you choose to invest with us. 
We also know why brilliant experts, professionals and innovators seek to become and remain IBMers. Together, we understand that we are at a turning point in IBM history
and in the history of technology. We are committed to doing what every prior generation of IBMers has done—transforming ourselves
to lead in a new era of business and technology, in order to remain essential to our clients and
to the world. 
My colleagues and I are excited and confident about the cognitive future, and we are working hard with our clients, partners
and peers to build it. I am proud of the IBM team for bringing us here, and I am grateful to you, our shareholders, for your steadfast support. 
"
IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2016,"It can be hard to assess the progress of a major transformation from a single year’s results. And yet, when you look back after a few years, it becomes clear just how much has changed. Before I offer a broader perspective, let me describe how your company performed in 2016. We made substantial progress last year: • We achieved operating earnings per share of $13.59 and free cash flow of $11.6 billion. • We invested heavily for our long-term competitiveness—nearly $6 billion in research and development, nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures and nearly $6 billion to make 15 acquisitions, adding to our capabilities in the high-growth areas of cognitive, cloud and security. • We returned $8.8 billion to you, our shareholders, including dividends of $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion in gross share repurchases. We raised our dividend for the 21st consecutive year—and it was IBM’s 101st straight year of providing one. We are proud of both milestones. • IBM’s technical community outdid itself. For the 24th year in a row, IBM led in U.S. patents earned, becoming the first company to break the 8,000 mark in one year. • All of this and more is due to the work and passion of 380,000 IBMers. They are our greatest competitive advantage and the most important reason for confidence in IBM’s prospects in the years ahead. This is why it’s so encouraging that employee engagement scores continue to rise year after year. But understanding IBM at the start of 2017 requires a longer view—in particular, remembering why we embarked on this journey of transformation. It had nothing to do with economic downturn or fixing something broken. Rather, our experience over more than a century has trained us to be vigilant. We began to see that the IT industry would radically reorder, driven by the phenomenon of data, the maturation of cloud computing and the emergence of what many call artificial intelligence or AI. We were convinced that the source of value— for our clients and for our owners—would shift, and that the convergence of these innovations would usher in a new era in both technology and business. We didn’t wait. We got out of commoditizing businesses—trimming $8 billion from our top line (and nothing from our bottom line) over the past five years. We redoubled our efforts to reinvent our core hardware, software and services franchises, while investing to create new ones—in cloud, data, cognitive, security and the other businesses that comprise our strategic imperatives. We did this not simply to manage a portfolio of businesses, but to build the integrated capability that our clients would need for the new era. While our transformation continues, a strong foundation is now in place. Our strategic imperatives have reached critical mass. At $33 billion, they now contribute 41 percent of IBM’s revenue. With double-digit growth, we’re on pace to achieve our goal of growing these businesses to $40 billion by 2018. Most importantly, within these businesses we have built unique and powerful platforms with Watson and the IBM Cloud: • Watson has become the AI platform for business. I will have much more to say about Watson, but just consider that, through our clients and ecosystem partners, we expect Watson to touch one billion people this year. • IBM is now the global leader in cloud for the enterprise. In 2016, our cloud business grew an outstanding 35 percent, to $13.7 billion (adjusted for the effects of currency, as are all revenue growth numbers in this letter). Cloud by itself is now more than 17 percent of our total revenues. Our as-a-Service exit run rate was $8.6 billion, up 63 percent. I am so proud of the teams who have incubated and scaled these businesses. They are the IBM investor’s “unicorns.” At the same time, we have transformed much of IBM’s core—the other 59 percent of our company. Global Technology Services (GTS) is the market leader in IT services. The next time you use your credit or debit card, take out an insurance policy, board a plane or drive your car, chances are you are being 
touched by GTS. Their services run the infrastructure that powers 60 percent of the banking industry’s daily card transactions, 61 percent of the automobile industry’s production of passenger vehicles and nearly half of mobile connections worldwide. And while our GTS team is superb at managing infrastructure, they are innovators at heart. In recent years, they have built strong capabilities in hybrid cloud and are applying automation and Watson wherever and as fast as they can. This unique combination of innovation and trust enables GTS to grow signings and revenue, and win new clients. Global Business Services continues to reinvent itself and is growing robustly where we have created new practices. Last year, our cloud practice was up more than 60 percent, mobile more than 40 percent and analytics 10 percent. That’s good—though not enough yet to offset declines in some traditional practices, such as enterprise resource planning. But I remain confident in our ability to transform this business, and we will continue to invest in these new areas. For example, we created a new Watson IoT (Internet of Things) consulting practice that will include 1,500 consultants, data scientists and security experts. When it comes to our ability to reinvent large, significant businesses, I must say a word about the mainframe. Installed mainframe capacity has increased 20-fold in the past 20 years—and is still growing, as you saw in our fourth-quarter 2016 results. Why do clients love the mainframe? Because no other system can do what it can do, and because our mainframe team continues to create new capabilities for new workloads. Our latest mainframe runs Linux, processes mobile payments instantly, supports hybrid clouds and is becoming preferred as the most secure platform for the important new technology blockchain. This is why I call this part of IBM our youngest oldest business. Leading a new era With Watson’s victory on Jeopardy! in 2011, IBM ended the latest so-called “AI winter” and led our industry and the world into the cognitive era. Today, we’re no longer alone: The land rush into AI is on—including a lot of hype. But we expect to maintain and extend our lead in cognitive business, because we uniquely serve the needs of the enterprise. Enterprises need cognitive solutions that turn vast amounts of data into insights and competitive advantage. They need access to a cloud platform not only for IT capability, but for speed and agility. Its architecture must be hybrid, spanning both public and private clouds, because businesses will want to leverage their existing investments in applications, IT infrastructure and, most of all, their data. And they need a partner they trust, who understands their industry and process flows, and whose platform is secure, scalable, global in scope and local in presence. IBM provides this powerful AI cloud platform, and we are using it to build industry-based solutions to real-world problems. We are creating domain-specific datasets that we either own or partner to access, and we’re applying our deep industry expertise to build vertical solutions and to train Watson in specific professional fields. In short, to win in the cognitive era, data matters. Client control of their data and insights matters. Public, hybrid and enterprise-strength cloud matters. Industry expertise matters. Trust and security matter. That is what sets apart Watson on the IBM Cloud—and why thousands of clients, partners and IBM itself are building powerful solutions and businesses on it: • IBM Watson Health leverages broad datasets, including 100 million electronic health records, 200 million healthcare claims records and millions of images. You also need clinical data, payer data and images, all of which are created and owned by clients. (Consider that an estimated 80 percent of the world’s data cannot be accessed by search engines.) We capture and integrate all this data, because publicly available data alone is not sufficient for work like transforming healthcare or making advances in cancer. What’s more, you need deep domain expertise. Watson Health’s 7,000 employees include doctors, nurses, health policy experts and data scientists. Finally, we provide a quality management system that is HIPAA-compliant. Only IBM Watson Health offers all of this capability. 
IBM Watson IoT has similar unique advantages. The number of new clients and developers using our platform more than doubled last year. Our new global Watson IoT center in Munich opened in 2017, including the first-ever Cognitive IoT Collaboratories, where clients and IBMers work together to drive innovation in automotive, electronics, manufacturing, healthcare and insurance. • Late last year, we launched Watson Financial Services. And because top industry specialists are needed to train Watson in the risk management requirements of financial services, we acquired Promontory Financial Group, a leader in regulatory compliance and risk management consulting. IBM is changing industries around the world. Watson on the IBM Cloud is available to more than 200 million consumers to answer questions, find what they need online and make recommendations. Half a million students can choose courses and master a subject with Watson, which also helps teachers address each student’s unique learning needs. IBM Security—which monitors 35 billion security events a day for 12,000 clients spanning 133 countries— launched the world’s first commercial “cyber range,” where clients can simulate and prepare for real-world attacks and draw on the power of Watson to fight cybercrime. With Watson, buildings are reducing CO2 emissions by 10 million tons a year; businesses are accelerating hiring cycles by 75 percent; and airlines are improving maintenance efficiency by 80 percent. It is also becoming clear that as IT moves to the cloud, transactions must be trusted by all parties involved. That is why we are building a complete blockchain platform. Blockchain brings together shared ledgers with smart contracts to allow the secure transfer of any asset—whether a physical asset like a shipping container, a financial asset like a bond or a digital asset like music—across any business network. Blockchain will do for trusted transactions what the Internet did for information. IBM is already working with more than 400 clients to pioneer blockchain for business. They include clients who manage foreign exchange settlements, smart contracts, identity management and trade finance—but the potential goes well beyond financial services. For instance, we are collaborating with Walmart to ensure transparency in the way food is tracked, transported and sold to consumers across China and the United States. And Everledger is using a cloudbased blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other high-value goods as they move through the supply chain. This is the real world of cognitive business. Unlike the AI we see in movies and pop culture—which depict machines achieving consciousness or independent agency— the true promise of this revolutionary technology comes not from replacing but from augmenting human intelligence. It comes from embedding cognitive capability in the processes, systems, products and services that permeate business, society and our daily lives. New roads and new rules for a cognitive future As 2017 begins, our industry stands at an inflection point. The next few years will be critical for information technology providers, as businesses and institutions around the world will make key architectural decisions—about cloud, about data, about AI. IBM is well positioned to help clients make wise choices—and to lead our competition. We take seriously our responsibility to ensure that new technology is adopted in ways that are both ethical and enduring— never more essential than in times of rapid economic and societal change. We will continue to engage across our industry and society, and to advocate for a business and policy environment that is open, inclusive, global and equitable. And we will do more than advocate. We will innovate. An example of such innovation is IBM’s “Principles for Transparency and Trust in the Cognitive Era,” which we issued in January of this year. Its main tenets: • We believe AI’s purpose is to augment human intelligence. • We will be transparent about when and where AI is being applied, and about the data and training that went into its recommendations. • We believe our clients’ data and insights are theirs. • We are committed to helping students, workers and citizens acquire the skills to 
engage safely, securely and effectively with cognitive systems, and to do the new kinds of work that will emerge in a cognitive economy. These principles will be our touchstone for everything we do to build this new world. We will practice them with our clients, and we believe they can form an important foundation for business and society at large. A world with Watson Last October, IBM hosted more than 15,000 entrepreneurs, innovators and other leaders from business, government, healthcare and civil society who are working with Watson to transform their industries and sectors. Their work showed that Watson has, indeed, entered the world at scale. But this signature gathering did something more than showcase the reality and reach of Watson. It also presented a vision of the world with Watson. In example after example, we saw a world that is healthier, more secure, less wasteful, more productive, more personalized, more sustainable. That is a world my colleagues and I want to live in. Indeed, this is, in the end, why we are IBMers—and why we remain so deeply committed to the hopeful future that is now within our grasp. As IBM has done throughout its history, we remain dedicated to leading the world into a more prosperous and progressive future; to creating a world that is fairer, more diverse, more tolerant, more just; and to creating long-term value for you. Our strategy to reinvent our company is being validated by our clients around the world, and has the support of our Board of Directors. I’m grateful to them and to you, our owners, for your continued support. Most of all, I am deeply proud of the IBM team for bringing us here and for what they do every day for our great company.

IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2017,"Dear IBM Investor: The businesses of the world are changing the way they work. We have prepared your company for this moment. During the past five years, propelled by our belief that the phenomenon of data would reorder technology and business, we have undertaken one of the most ambitious reinventions in IBM’s modern history. This phase is largely complete. IBM is now a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. IBM now possesses capabilities that are unmatched in our industry to address our clients’ most pressing needs. In my letter to you this year, I will describe our performance in 2017, which reflects the progress we have made in building these capabilities. And I will explain why we believe this moment marks an inflection point, not just for our company, but for business and society at large.
The substantial progress we made last year We achieved operating earnings per share of $13.80, up 2 percent. Our revenue for the year was $79.1 billion, with operating pre-tax income of $13.9 billion. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue 4 percent, 1 percent adjusted for the effects of currency (as are all other revenue numbers in this letter). We did so in significant part because our strategic imperatives reached critical mass. With revenue of $36.5 billion and growing 11 percent, these products and services now contribute 46 percent of IBM’s revenue. And we expect to achieve our goal of growing these new products and services to $40 billion in 2018. Watson strengthened its position as the AI platform for business. We are embedding AI into more of what we offer— including security, the Internet of Things, commerce and verticals, such as Watson Health. Together, these helped IBM’s Cognitive Solutions business generate more than $18 billion in revenue in 2017. We also remained the global leader in cloud for the enterprise. In 2017, our cloud revenue grew 24 percent, to $17 billion. Cloud by itself is now more than 21 percent of our total revenue. Our reinvented systems franchises generated strong growth. Mainframes enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter, thanks to the launch of the new z14, the world’s first system that can encrypt data pervasively without requiring changes to applications and with no downtime. We expect this breakthrough will drive significant expansion of the mainframe’s already broad market. Similarly, we are reinventing our services business. Global Business Services saw signings growth throughout the year, as clients engaged with our high-value consulting practices in areas such as AI, blockchain, and digital strategy and design. In addition, our Technology Services and Cloud Platform team is working with clients worldwide to integrate public, private and managed cloud environments through a single architecture. IBM is the clear leader in quantum computing. The world’s first (and only) prototype 50-qubit system, announced in 2017, was a major step toward systems that can tackle problems beyond the scope of classical computation. Through IBM Q Experience, the world’s first publicly available quantum computers, more than 75,000 users have run more than 2.5 million quantum experiments. A dozen clients, including partners JPMorgan Chase, Daimler AG, Samsung and JSR, are now exploring practical applications on our latest commercial systems. We have also achieved global leadership in blockchain. By providing a permissioned and immutable shared ledger, blockchain is doing for trusted transactions what the Internet did for information. Hundreds of leading organizations already have embraced IBM’s blockchain platform. Walmart, Nestlé, Dole, Kroger and others are applying blockchain to improve food safety. Early in 2018, we announced a joint venture with Maersk to apply blockchain to the complex world of international shipping. We also are working with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) on new blockchain approaches for complex derivatives, such as credit default swaps. Finally, 2017 saw a milestone in innovation as IBM, for the 25th year in a row, led the world in U.S. patents earned, setting a new record of 9,043. Importantly, nearly half of those patents were in AI, cloud, blockchain, quantum, security and other technologies that will power our portfolio for years to come. We did all this while continuing to invest heavily for long-term competitiveness—$5.6 billion in research and development and $3.3 billion in net capital expenditures, adding to the capabilities of our high-growth strategic businesses. We also returned $9.8 billion to you, our owners, including dividends of $5.5 billion and $4.3 billion in gross share repurchases. We raised our dividend for the 22nd consecutive year—it was IBM’s 102nd straight year of providing one. All of this is due to the creativity and passion of IBMers. They are the reason we have reached an inflection point, and they are our greatest competitive advantage.
Inflection points This is not just an inflection point for IBM. It is also an inflection point for our clients—the enterprises and institutions of the world. Until a year or so ago, you would find many who believed that “digital disruption” was here to stay. They believed that the world’s incumbent businesses were at risk of being marginalized. We had a different point of view. We did not believe the platform giants alone would dominate a data-centric economy—in large measure because they lack access to the most valuable sources of the world’s data: the 80 percent that is not searchable on the Web. The world’s incumbent businesses and institutions own and generate this data, coming from their professional expertise, their industry’s practices and market dynamics, their processes and operations, their people and cultures. Therefore, we believe they are positioned to lead. In this letter and throughout this report, you will find the names of many of the world’s great enterprises and institutions. This is not a coincidence. It is a reflection of an important new reality: The incumbents of the world understand that they can be the new disruptors, and they are going on offense to seize this opportunity and to capture this moment. They are doing so by becoming smarter businesses. • Businesses are becoming smarter by leveraging intelligent digital platforms. The IBM Cloud has emerged as the platform of choice for business—built for all applications, ready for AI and secure to the core. It is the unifying platform for IBM’s capabilities, integrated into a single architecture that spans public and private clouds. Through this powerful platform, we are delivering to the world’s businesses a continuous stream of innovative capabilities: computation and storage, data and Watson services, IoT and blockchain services, and IBM Q. • Businesses are becoming smarter by making their systems and processes intelligent—which is why IBM’s services and solutions are grounded in deep knowledge of our clients’ industries. This has made IBM the partner of choice for smarter businesses’ digital and cognitive transformation and IT services. Clients include RBS, Autodesk and Hyundai Card, as well as the large client bases of our strategic partners, such as Salesforce, Workday, Apple, SAP and VMware. This deep industry dimension is also what has allowed us to establish successful new solutions businesses, such as Watson Health, Watson IoT and Watson Financial Services. • Businesses are becoming smarter by embedding AI and data to change how work is done, equipping themselves for an era of man + machine. Watson for Oncology is helping doctors identify treatment options for their patients at more than 150 hospitals around the world, including Gachon University Gil Medical Center in South Korea, Svet Zdravia in Slovakia and Taipei Medical University in Taiwan. A year ago, Watson for Oncology was trained in four types of cancer. Today, it is trained in multidisciplinary support for 13 cancer types. Watson is helping tax preparers at H&R Block provide the best advice to millions of clients. Bankers and customer service representatives at Crédit Mutuel, Banco Bradesco, Orange Bank and other financial institutions are reinventing banking. Woodside Energy chose Watson to help it preserve the institutional knowledge—and reinvent the work—of petroleum engineers. You can read in this report how these and other leaders are making their companies smarter, in all dimensions. They are placing big bets on the future to increase their competitiveness and to reconnect with their company’s true reason for being.
We also stand at an inflection point for society, everywhere in the world. IBM does not believe that the future belongs to the few. We believe it belongs to all of us—and we translate that belief into practice and policy. On data and AI responsibility: As the world’s new natural resource, unleashed by the maturation of AI, data holds the potential to generate growth, prosperity and societal progress. But it will only do so if the world can trust that data is being collected, managed and analyzed responsibly. At a time when many are questioning the power and behavior of some companies, IBM is stepping forward as a responsible steward of data and AI. We believe that AI’s purpose is to augment, not replace, human intelligence. We are clear on the need for transparency—on where AI is used, who trained it and what data sets were ingested. We also believe that data and the insights it generates belong to their creators. No one should have to give up ownership or control of their data to benefit from AI and cloud computing. We have built and are deploying Watson accordingly. Trust also requires the protection of data through strong encryption and security systems that are constantly tested and strengthened. The privacy of data must be respected. Those, too, are core dimensions of the IBM Cloud with Watson. On jobs: Without question, new technology will eliminate work; it always has. At the same time, new job categories will emerge. The challenge, however, is that AI will transform the skills required for all jobs. There still will be doctors, lawyers, salespeople, teachers and engineers. But the tasks and tools they need to perform their work will be different.
This is why building skills for the jobs of the future—not blue collar or white collar, but “new collar” jobs—will require a major reinvention of education. We at IBM are leading that transformation, in the U.S. and worldwide, through public-private partnerships to create the revolutionary Pathways in Technology Early College High Schools (P-TECH) education model, 21st century apprenticeships and retraining programs. This includes investing $5 billion over 10 years in the continuous renewal of IBMers and the re-skilling of mid-career professionals looking to get back into the tech workforce. On inclusion: Today, we proudly carry forward a global commitment to inclusion that has defined IBM for more than a century. We are stepping forward to support the open exchange of people, information and ideas, as well as to protect cross-border data flows for international privacy and security agreements. IBM is the recognized gold standard for inclusion, reflected in winning the 2018 Catalyst Award for advancing women in business. IBM is the first company to win this award four times. We advocate for fairness and equality—as everyone is, and always has been, welcome at IBM. For more than a century, IBMers have earned the world’s trust by building progress with responsibility. We continue this legacy today. Rediscovering IBM At the deepest level, the most important fact about IBM’s 2017 was not our return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter or the continued scaling of our new products and services or our patent achievement. It is our reaffirmation of IBM’s essential identity. IBM is an enterprise technology company. We deliver services with the simplicity, speed and delight of the best consumer products and services, but we are very clear on whom we serve. We are dedicated to our clients’ success, and our reinvention during the past five years has been driven by helping our clients serve their customers. This unrelenting focus on the client is a particular source of pride.
We also are clear on the markets we serve. IBM is global in presence and mind-set. We earn trust. We take positions—and act—on issues that matter for our time. Today, that begins with data, AI and security, and extends to inclusion and trust. Put it all together, and you have a company that always has been unique in combining innovative technology with deep industry expertise, underpinned by security, trust and responsible stewardship. In helping businesses move from era to era, we seek to be essential—to our clients and to the world. Let me close by expressing my gratitude to the treasured clients we serve, and to the hundreds of thousands of IBMers whose brilliance and resilience make it possible for us all to achieve our life’s work at the world’s most essential enterprise. I never have been more optimistic in my IBM career—optimistic about our technology, about our clients, about IBM and about the world we are building together.
"
IBM,IBM,Info Tech,2018,"Dear IBM Investor: 2018 was a defining year for IBM and our clients. Your company returned to growth, just as businesses readied to enter Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions. For years, we have focused on building the tools businesses need in the 21st century. Our investments have reshaped IBM to lead in the emerging, high-value segments of the IT market, including analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud, security, blockchain and quantum computing. At the same time, we have deepened our longstanding commitment to the responsible stewardship of technology. IBM is now ready to help our clients advance their business transformations. In my letter to you this year, I will describe IBM’s performance in 2018. I will outline how clients are poised to enter Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions, with help from IBM, and how this translates to growth for IBM, for businesses and for the world. 2018: Return to Growth In 2018, IBM achieved $79.6 billion in revenue and operating earnings per share of $13.81. For the full year, we returned to revenue growth, grew earnings per share and stabilized margins. Our strategic and continued investment in innovative technology drove our improved competitive position and profit dynamics. Offerings that address data, AI, cloud, analytics and cybersecurity now represent more than half of our revenue—up from a quarter just four years ago—accounting for approximately $40 billion in revenue in 2018. Our investment of more than $5 billion in research and development produced thousands of breakthrough innovations, which led to IBM’s 26th consecutive year of U.S. patent leadership. Of the 9,100 patents granted to IBM in 2018, more than 1,600 were related to AI and 1,400 to cybersecurity—more than any other company in either area.
This focus on breakthrough innovation has created IBM’s strongest portfolio ever and has driven results: – Total cloud revenues were more than $19 billion in 2018, up 12 percent. In the fourth quarter alone, IBM signed 16 client services agreements worth more than $100 million to help optimize business performance on the IBM Cloud. Today, 47 of the Fortune 50 depend on the IBM Cloud. – IBM is the world’s enterprise AI leader. Solutions enabled by IBM Watson are helping produce better decision-making and business outcomes through more than 20,000 client engagements, across 20 industries to date. IDC ranked IBM number one in AI market share. We continue to pioneer innovations in natural language processing, speech processing, computer vision and machine learning. – IBM Blockchain is the global leader in improving trust and transparency across business networks by creating a new way for clients to share and secure data. IBM Blockchain now powers more than 500 client projects, with more than 85 active networks transforming supply chains, global shipping and cross-border finance. – IBM Security, the world’s largest cybersecurity enterprise, has 8,000 subject matter experts serving more than 17,000 clients in more than 130 countries. The industry’s leading AI and cloud-based security solutions include IBM Security Connect, launched in 2018, which allows clients to gather, integrate and analyze security data across multiple applications and tools, in a vendor-agnostic way. – IBM Systems produces innovative infrastructure for AI and hybrid cloud. The z14 is one of IBM’s most successful mainframe programs in history, with broad global adoption across 27 different industry segments. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy’s POWER9-based supercomputers, Summit and Sierra, were ranked the most powerful supercomputers in the world in 2018. – IBM Services was a key driver of IBM’s performance in 2018. Forty-seven engagements worth more than $100 million each helped major clients—like Bank of the Philippine Islands, Juniper Networks, Nordea, Westpac and Aditya Birla Retail— move to the next stage of their digital transformations. New IBM investments are further energizing our portfolio. In late 2018, we announced plans to acquire Red Hat, the world’s leading open source technology provider for the enterprise. With this acquisition, which is expected to close in the second half of 2019, IBM will enhance our position as the world’s number one hybrid cloud provider, helping clients unlock the full business value of the cloud. We also continued to divest stand-alone software and services assets that are no longer strategic for IBM. At the same time, we remained committed to returning capital to our shareholders. In 2018, we returned more than $10 billion to you, our shareholders, including dividends of $5.7 billion and gross share repurchases of $4.4 billion. We raised our dividend for the 23rd consecutive year—IBM’s 103rd straight year of providing one. Moving Clients to the Next Chapter of Digital Reinvention For the past several years, businesses around the world have been driving their digital reinventions to take advantage of data, their most powerful source of competitive advantage. This first chapter has been defined largely by experimenting with narrow and disparate AI applications and moving simple workloads—typically consumer and customer-facing applications— to the cloud. Now, we are beginning to see the contours of Chapter 2 among pioneering businesses: moving from experimentation to true business transformation at scale with AI and hybrid cloud. This next chapter of digital reinvention will be enterprisedriven. It will be characterized first by scaling AI and embedding it everywhere in business. Second, in cloud, it will be characterized by moving mission-critical applications to hybrid cloud— using a combination of multiple public clouds, private clouds, and on-premise IT capabilities, so businesses can create the environment most suitable for their enterprise workloads. Underpinning it all is the growing importance of trust, both in technologies and in their impact on the world. Scaling AI throughout the Enterprise In Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions, businesses will begin to scale AI across the enterprise, as some first movers are already demonstrating. Take the world’s leading banks, for example. While many have been applying AI to specific challenges, some first movers are scaling AI across the enterprise. Orange Bank, one of the fastest growing mobile banks in France, now manages all customer 
service through IBM Watson. Similarly, Banco Bradesco is now using IBM Watson to assist every member of its services team—resolving customer inquiries in seconds with nearly 95 percent accuracy. IBM brought AI for business into the mainstream with the introduction of our Watson platform in 2014. Today, IBM Watson is the most open and trusted AI for business, available to run on any environment—on premise, and in private and public clouds. Businesses can apply Watson to data wherever it is hosted and infuse AI into their applications, regardless of where they reside. With Watson Studio, Watson Machine Learning and Watson OpenScale, IBM delivers a suite of tools that allow enterprises to build, deploy and manage their AI models in a hybrid cloud environment. IBM Watson OpenScale, a first-of-a-kind platform introduced in 2018, also enables businesses to manage their AI— no matter where it was built or where it runs—with transparency, explainability and bias mitigation. Addressing these factors, which traditionally have held businesses back, is critical for scaling AI throughout an enterprise. Through IBM Services, we are helping our clients around the world apply AI to core business processes and workflows, infusing their businesses with automation, intelligence and continuous learning to transform everything from supply chains and HR to finance and operations. In 2018, we also launched a new service called IBM Talent and Transformation that addresses the often overlooked cultural aspects of AI. This service helps our clients ensure their teams have the right skills and talent—and the supporting culture and work environment—to support a new way of working that is critical to scaling AI for business. Moving Mission-Critical Work to Hybrid Cloud In the first chapter of digital reinvention, cloud deployments largely focused on easily portable workloads for productivity and commodity computing. This primarily was driven by user-facing applications inspired by advances in consumer technology. As a result, only 20 percent of enterprise workloads today have moved to the cloud. The remaining 80 percent of enterprise workloads provides the real value opportunity for business—transforming missioncritical workloads and applications for the cloud. The challenge is that most businesses have unique regulatory or data requirements and anywhere from five to 15 clouds across multiple providers. 
That is why businesses moving to Chapter 2 will need to embrace a new, hybrid cloud approach. It is one that will allow them to more easily move data and scale AI and other applications across public, private and on-premise IT in their enterprises, with consistent management and security protocols, using open source technology. For example, BNP Paribas, a leading European bank, is working with IBM to speed and scale the launch of new digital and AI customer services across the cloud, while protecting the security and confi dentiality of customer data. Similarly, global telecom leader Vodafone Business is partnering with IBM to innovate the way it delivers multicloud and digital capabilities—including AI, edge computing, 5G and software-defi ned networking solutions—to its customers. IBM Services provides end-to-end cloud integration capabilities and is helping thousands of businesses migrate, integrate and manage applications and workloads seamlessly and securely across any cloud environment. Industry experts from IBM Services are co-creating cloud-enabled solutions with clients in our IBM Garages. Using design thinking and agile methods, we are helping clients implement new ways of working, such as rapid prototyping and iteration to more quickly move technology projects from pilot to production at scale. We are ready for this moment of moving clients to Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions with our unique integration of innovative technology, industry expertise and a reputation for trust and security earned over decades. IBM is now moving the world’s major enterprises to the next era, an effort that will be enhanced by our planned acquisition of Red Hat. Chapter 2 of Trust and Responsible Stewardship We recognize that our clients and the consumers they serve expect more than groundbreaking innovation and industry expertise. They want to work with technology partners they can trust to protect their data and handle it responsibly. They want to work with partners who know how to bring new technologies into the world safely and help society benefi t from them. And they want their partners to create inclusive workplaces and communities where diversity thrives.
These expectations are linked by a common theme: responsibility. Responsibility has been a hallmark of IBM’s culture for 107 years—from our labs to our boardroom. IBMers’ unwavering global commitment to the responsible stewardship of data and powerful new technologies has earned us the trust of clients and society as a whole. In 2018, as trust in technology came under heightened global scrutiny, we published our IBM Principles for Trust and Transparency, which have long guided our company. They stress our belief that the purpose of new technologies is to augment— not replace—human intelligence, and that the data and insights derived from technology belong to the businesses who own them. The principles also emphasize that new technologies brought into the world must be open, transparent, explainable and free of bias. We know that AI, like other transformative technologies before it, will have a profound impact on peoples’ jobs and the workplace. That is why, in 2018, IBM further expanded access to the pathways through which students and professionals can build skills for today’s technology era. That includes “new collar” jobs, where having the right skills matters more than having a specific degree. Through our work in 11 U.S. states and 13 countries, there will be 200 Pathways in Technology Early College High Schools— or P-TECHs—serving a pipeline of 125,000 students in the 2019 school year. 2018 also saw the rapid growth of our IBM Apprenticeship Program, which trains people in 21st-century skills ranging from blockchain and digital design to cybersecurity—and which expanded nearly twice as fast as we had projected in its first year. Yet skills are only part of today’s workforce opportunity. In 2018, fueled by record diverse hiring, promotion and retention, we achieved our greatest progress in a decade on diversity representation among global executive women and underrepresented minorities. We also continued advocating with governments around the world for policies that help ensure workplaces are as inclusive and diverse as the world we live in. Recognizing that responsible stewardship should not be confined within IBM’s walls, we also are working aggressively to empower others to do lasting good. We are, for example, a founding partner in Call for Code, a global initiative that works with software developers to create solutions that can help save lives. Last year, 100,000 open source developers from 156 countries responded to the call, creating more than 2,500 applications to help communities recover from natural disasters. As IBM sees it, the promise of technology is to empower people to do good, access new opportunities and make the world better, safer and smarter—for the many, not just the few. IBM Poised to Lead In summary, we have returned your company to growth. We have positioned IBM’s products, services and people to enable clients to write the next chapter of their digital reinventions. And we have done it all while reaffirming IBM’s longstanding reputation for trust, integrity and responsibility. Our work ahead is to build on this progress and bring these capabilities to life for our clients. I want to thank all of our clients for partnering with us while we reinvented IBM, and for choosing us for their own journeys of transformation. I also would like to thank our investors for their confidence in IBM. Finally, I would like to thank the hundreds of thousands of IBMers whose expertise has prepared us to lead in this new chapter of digital reinvention. I am honored to steward this great company, and I am filled with optimism about what we can achieve in partnership with our clients and society. Together, we are changing work and business— and ultimately, the world.

Adobe Inc.,ADBE,Info Tech,2000,"It’s hard to believe that it has been only ten years since Adobe Photoshop changed the way graphic designers work with images destined for the printed page. At that time, we couldn’t have guessed the extent of its influence. During the past decade, Adobe has distributed more than 30 million units of products based on Photoshop software, and Photoshop technology has transformed the way information is presented on the World Wide Web. Today, with a full suite of equally powerful applications, Adobe Systems has become a recognized leader in the creation, management, and delivery of rich Web content seen by millions of people worldwide. And more than 200 million copies of Acrobat Reader software have been distributed worldwide, making Adobe a global household name. As we continue to help people communicate through the creation of visually rich information, we are pursuing the many opportunities afforded by the next generation of Internet-enabled innovations, including broadband, wireless, and Internet appliance technologies. In fiscal 2000, these pursuits translated into a record year for Adobe Systems. Our diluted earnings per share increased by 23%, from $0.92 to $1.13 year over year, and our operating profit increased by 57% year over year. We achieved seven consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth and six consecutive quarters of record revenue. Led by a highly focused management team, we executed on our existing business plan and began to set the stage for Network Publishing, a visionary Internet-centric publishing model in which all types of digital content can be published and viewed by anyone, anywhere, on any device. As Adobe Systems continues to develop inspiring software, to catalyze innovative new markets, and to provide leadership for the Network Publishing community, we’re operating from an unprecedented position of strength. And although we will never stop refining our operational controls, our newest phase of growth relies directly upon our growing software application revenue. Simply put, we’re ready— financially, strategically, and creatively — for What’s Next. RECORD NUMBERS BECOME REALIT Y In fiscal 2000, Adobe exceeded its internal annual revenue budget, and for the second consecutive year, revenue exceeded $1 billion, reaching a new high of $1.266 billion. This represents a 25% increase compared with fiscal 1999. Reported net income reached a record level of $288 million, a 21% increase compared with fiscal 1999. 
Adobe’s Web Publishing revenue grew to $536.6 million, a 36% increase over fiscal 1999. Cross-media Publishing revenue grew to $390.5 million, a 10% increase. Success of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper Solutions application revenue from $129.3 million to $207.8 million, an increase of 61% over 1999. And as we projected, revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined in 2000—from $138.2 million to $131.5 million, which is a drop-off of 5%. The growth and strength in our other market segments more than offset this decline. OUR LEANEST OPER ATIONS EVER Adobe has been improving and refining company-wide operations to produce a lean, efficient organization capable of agile responses in a fast-moving marketplace. Leveraging a state-of-the-art financial system, we are now at the forefront of operational excellence in the industry. Among other achievements, we have streamlined our worldwide accounting process so we can now close two days after the quarter ends. Improvements like this have helped us build a highly predictable business operation that can readily scale as the company grows. 
During fiscal 2000, direct costs were reduced, helping to increase gross margins from 90.7% in fiscal 1999 to 93.1% in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative overhead was reduced from 10.2% to 9.2%. With carefully managed expenses, operating profit increased to $408.1 million in fiscal 2000. REVENUE GROW TH THROUGH APPLIC ATIONS While tight operational controls contributed significantly to our overall fiscal health, our growth was driven primarily by record revenue from our industry-standard applications. Web and print professionals enjoyed new versions of our flagship products. Both Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and Adobe Illustrator 9.0 software delivered significant enhancements for working with rich Web content. With an expanded feature set and tighter integration with other Adobe applications, Adobe GoLive 5.0 software garnered rave product reviews. And Adobe LiveMotion software gave Web designers an intuitive software tool that integrates with Photoshop and GoLive and produces compelling Web animations in the Macromedia® Flash ™ (SWF) file format. As Web publishers compete for attention online, they are beginning to integrate rich media and streaming video into their Web sites. In the midst of this trend, Adobe continued to benefit as the leading provider of video-editing tools for broadcast professionals. And with dynamic media products such as Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects software, we are taking advantage of all aspects of the current Web media convergence. From site building tools to digital video and imaging software, Adobe empowers Web designers to showcase their products online, build strong Web brands, and make e-commerce a reality. For cross-media professionals, we continued to deliver layout tools that streamline the management of digital assets between the print and Web worlds. The latest update to Adobe InDesign software addressed many of our customers’ workflow concerns, and we increased our investment in markets where we are working to establish InDesign as the professional layout application of choice. While this market will not grow as rapidly as Web Publishing, it nonetheless represents a $500 million per year opportunity that we continue to pursue. Adobe PageMaker software enjoyed strong success with business professionals, and Adobe FrameMaker® software continued to be the preferred application for the publication of complex technical documents. Adobe’s solutions for page layout, illustration, business publishing, and printing enable graphic designers, production artists, and prepress professionals to create the visually rich information we see every day on the printed page.
BEYOND THE ENTERPRISE Built on the foundation of Adobe Portable Document Format, Adobe ePaper Solutions continued to bridge the worlds of digital and paper-based information in corporations, government agencies, and other large organizations. And while revenue from Adobe Acrobat set all-time records in 2000, Adobe ePaper Solutions are now reaching far beyond the enterprise. In 2000, Adobe PDF became an important format in the emerging eBook market. In March, Stephen King’s Riding the Bullet became the first book from a major author to be published only in Adobe PDF. And in September, Adobe acquired Glassbook, Inc., further solidifying our position as a leader in this young but extremely promising space. As the eBook market continues to evolve, we plan to offer solutions that allow the easy reading and printing of Adobe PDF– based eBook content from any device. And as the Internet becomes the preferred medium for exchanging information, Adobe ePaper Solutions will continue to provide innovative tools for preserving documents exactly as intended and exchanging them securely with anyone, anywhere. As we pioneer new markets and help define the future of publishing, we must also remember our roots. PostScript, the page description language that launched Adobe and helped start the Desktop Publishing revolution, is still the technology graphics pros and publishers rely on for quality printing. That’s one of the main reasons the OEM PostScript and Other segment of our business composed 10% of our overall revenue in fiscal 2000. NETWORK PUBLISHING As the Third Wave of the modern publishing revolution, Network Publishing will enable the streamlined creation, management, and delivery of visual content that can be deployed across any device—including Web-enabled wireless phones, Internet appliances, and PDAs. Adobe is leveraging our legacy of leadership, especially our workflow expertise, to make this vision a reality. But we’re not doing it alone. In October 2000, several industry leaders— including Interwoven, HewlettPackard, Nokia, RealNetworks, and ATG — announced support for the joint development of complementary technologies that will empower both corporations and individuals to communicate like never before. Network Publishing promises to be just as important to the coming decade as Desktop Publishing and Web Publishing were to the ’80s and ’90s. The opportunity to change the way technology is developed and deployed, along with holistic employee benefits and a uniquely creative work environment, are just a few of the reasons that hundreds of engineers as well as sales, marketing, finance, and support professionals choose to work at Adobe. In fact, this year Adobe Systems can be found once again in FORTUNE Magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work for.” We are also among the technology leaders committed to making a difference. Through cash grants, employee volunteer support, and nonprofit training, the Adobe Community Relations program makes significant contributions in the areas of K–12 education, fair housing, and other social services. More information on these programs is available at www.adobe.com /aboutadobe/philanthropy. At Adobe, we consider ourselves to have four primary constituents: our customers, our stockholders, our employees, and our community. By continuing to provide inspiring products, increasing stockholder value, creating an innovative workplace, and investing in community relations, we strive to address each constituent’s needs. We thank you for your part in making Adobe successful.

Adobe Inc.,ADBE,Info Tech,2001,"To Our Stockholders During fiscal 2001, Adobe Systems assumed a leadership role in turning the promise of Network Publishing into reality. Working closely with our partners, we delivered powerful software tools that help our customers publish anything, anywhere, on any device. We listened closely to our customers to discover how Network Publishing is unfolding in today’s changing communications environment. We introduced technologies that enable the delivery of highly personalized, visually rich content—and the industry took notice. Communications from both our partners and competitors echoed our vision and are helping to establish Network Publishing as the model for the next wave of publishing. Just as important, Adobe ePaper Solutions made further strides into the enterprise, and Adobe PDF has provided a foundation for streamlined corporate and government electronic document workflows worldwide. Even with these successes, Adobe Systems, like many technology leaders, experienced a difficult fiscal 2001. Our diluted earnings per share decreased from $1.13 to $0.83 year over year, and our operating profit decreased by 7% year over year. One of the greatest factors contributing to these results was the widespread decision by enterprises to defer capital investments, including software purchases. And creative professionals—our core customers—were hit particularly hard as corporations spent less on marketing and advertising programs. As Adobe tracks these and other trends, we are working toward meeting our customers’ changing needs.
As enterprises and governments worldwide streamlined their processes to more fully leverage their Internet-based infrastructures, we delivered Adobe ePaper Solutions, such as Adobe Acrobat, to drive this evolution from paper-based to digital workflows. In April, we shipped Adobe Acrobat 5.0, which has garnered excellent reviews and impressive revenue. In fact, despite the difficult economic environment, revenue from Acrobat software grew more than 40% over fiscal 2000 and now represents 24% of Adobe’s total revenue. For large organizations implementing Web-based electronic forms solutions, we introduced Adobe Acrobat Approval software. And newly released versions of Acrobat Reader for Palm OS and Pocket PC devices allowed publishers to deliver Adobe PDF files to millions of handheld device users.
Looking at the coming year, we are inspired by the opportunities that lie ahead. As publishers, advertising agencies, and creative professionals adopt Network Publishing workflows, Adobe will provide the tools they need to create, manage, and deliver visually rich communications. Surging sales of digital cameras and digital video recorders are opening a huge opportunity for Adobe’s marketleading imaging software. And the continued streamlining of corporate business processes means an even greater opportunity for Adobe ePaper Solutions, our fastest growing market segment. Leveraging these trends, our strong cash position, and continued operational excellence, we will ensure that Adobe continues to be everywhere our stockholders, partners, and customers look. 
In fiscal 2001, Adobe achieved revenue of $1.230 billion. This represents a 3% decrease compared with fiscal 2000. Reported net income reached a level of $205.6 million, a 29% decrease compared with fiscal 2000. Operating profit was $378.5 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2000. Based on our new operating segments, Adobe’s Graphics revenue was $543.4 million, a 10% decrease from fiscal 2000. Cross-media Publishing revenue was $289.6 million, an 11% decrease. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined in 2001, from $131.5 million to $104.8 million, a drop-off of 20%. And robust licensing of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper Solutions revenue from $207.6 million to $291.9 million, an increase of 41% over 2000. (For further information on our former and new business segments, please refer to our Form 10-K.)
Despite the difficult economic environment of fiscal 2001, we showed that we can tightly manage our business. We minimized direct costs, resulting in gross margins of 93.4%, compared with 93.1% in fiscal 2000. Additionally, soon after the economy began to affect our business during the year, we swiftly exercised company-wide operational expense reductions, which enabled us to deliver respectable bottom-line results. Adobe continues to be a highly profitable company, and we are operating from a strong financial position. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was 31% in fiscal 2001. On a pro forma basis, our operating profit margin (which excludes restructuring and other charges, acquired in-process research and development, and amortization of goodwill) was 33%. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $581.6 million as of November 30, 2001. And although we reduced our overall expenses during the year, we continued to increase research and development headcount. In fiscal 2001, Adobe spent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars on R&D. This investment will help position us for long-term growth and success. While some of Adobe’s competitors focused their efforts on developing either Web- or print-only publishing tools, we believed our customers would want to communicate both onscreen and on the printed page, and we developed our software solutions accordingly. In fiscal 2002, Adobe will continue to deliver cross-media applications that allow publishers to communicate cost-effectively in the medium of their choice. With the announcement of InDesign 2.0 software, we continued to rally support among professional publishers and designers looking for an alternative publishing application. Adobe PageMaker software continues to provide business users with the tools they need to communicate with impact, and Adobe FrameMaker software remains the application of choice for producers of long, structured documents. Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects are becoming increasingly popular, due to exceptional growth in the digital video (DV) market, where Adobe has a strong position in the professional segment. Customers making the switch from analog to digital photography are licensing our new consumer-oriented imaging software, Adobe Photoshop Elements. And for creative professionals working in print and on the Web, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator software continue to set the standard for high-end digital imaging and illustration, and they lead the market in their respective categories. 
After announcing our vision for Network Publishing last year, we worked hard to deliver tools that would allow anyone to create, manage, and deliver visually rich communications anytime, anywhere, on any device. The latest version of InDesign software allows the import and export of XML for unique layouts in print and on the Web. Adobe Illustrator 10 enables a dynamic data-driven graphics workflow, automating the most time-consuming production tasks. And Adobe AlterCast software, a new server-based application, allows the customization and delivery of optimized graphics to multiple access devices, including desktop computers, PDAs, and wireless phones. We also unveiled the eXtensible Metadata Platform (XMP), a new open standard for cross-media development that enables the easy and accurate exchange of publishing assets between software applications. Delivering high levels of interoperability, this new protocol opens up exciting opportunities for both Adobe and its strategic partners. Even though the development of world-class software tools remains a top priority, we begin fiscal 2002 with a renewed commitment to our customers. More than ever, we’re listening carefully to what our customers have to say, implementing product functionality and support levels based on their feedback. Internally, we’ve thoroughly reorganized our Customer Care organization, realigning its goals with those of our field sales teams so that we can more effectively meet our customers’ changing needs. Adobe continues to be equally committed to the needs of our community. Everywhere you look, Adobe employees are donating time, money, and expertise to a number of critical nonprofit causes—including initiatives in the fields of K–12 education, fair housing, and other social services—under the auspices of the Adobe Community Relations program. Adobe also contributed $500,000 in combined employee and corporate donations to the American Red Cross September 11 fund. 
Adobe continues to attract the very best talent. Although we slowed our hiring in fiscal 2001, we continued to invest in the future by filling critical positions throughout the year. As eager as we are for their expertise, these employees are equally eager to work for a company that FORTUNE magazine has included in its “100 Best Companies to Work For” list four of the last five years. We’ve all been on an economic roller coaster this past fiscal year. As we look to the near future, we are confident that we can manage Adobe Systems through difficult times. And our focus—as always—is on the long term. Once the current economic malaise subsides, we believe we will be well positioned to drive revenue growth and expand our profitability. We’ve aligned our product road map to match the growing trends we see not only in Network Publishing but also in digital imaging and digital video software. We’re excited about emerging opportunities in areas such as digital photo management, DVD authoring, and Internet printing—new markets we are actively exploring. And we’re charging more than half of our field sales organization with realizing our single largest growth opportunity, Adobe ePaper Solutions. With Acrobat and related products, we’re helping enterprises migrate from paper-based workflows to Web-centric electronic document workflows. Our market-leading franchise products and their loyal customers, our world-class global operation, and our highly profitable business continue to fuel our excitement about Adobe’s future. We look forward to sharing our ongoing success with you.

Adobe Inc.,ADBE,Info Tech,2002,"As Adobe Systems’ twentieth year of helping people communicate better comes to a close, we’re pleased to see our customers using Adobe solutions—as well as complementary technologies from our partners—to create, manage, and deliver visually rich information to anyone, anywhere, on any device. For the fourth consecutive year, strong sales of Adobe Acrobat software licenses have contributed to making the enterprise our single greatest market opportunity. We’ve made significant inroads with Adobe InDesign® page layout software. And Adobe Photoshop Elements software has been embraced by over a million customers as the professional-quality, mid-level digital imaging software of choice.
Still, this past year many of our core customers grappled with unfavorable business conditions and market uncertainty. Design agencies, publishing houses, and other creative organizations faced smaller client budgets and reduced staffing, leading them to decrease their spending on capital expenditures such as new software. As a result of this reduced demand, as well as an overall weakened global economy, our diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2002 decreased by 5% year over year from $0.83 to $0.79, and our operating profit decreased by 24% year over year. In this difficult economic climate, we concentrated on reinforcing our strong market positions and preparing ourselves for the future with increased research and development. The results of our efforts will allow us to take advantage of several culminating market trends. Cost-conscious enterprises are looking to find greater return on their existing technology investments, creative professionals are looking for ways to save money and improve efficiency, and home and office users need easy-to-use software to help them work with a new generation of digital cameras and video cameras. Adobe plans to roll out solutions that address each of these trends, and we’ve realigned our organization to more effectively deliver these solutions to an eager customer base. In addition to a strong product roadmap, we remain profitable, with a strong cash position achieved through highly disciplined operational controls. Our transparent reporting system gives us a 24/7 view into worldwide operations, leading to greater efficiencies and reduced costs. Unusual among software companies, this financial strength gives Adobe a competitive advantage and long-term confidence. With a combination of powerful customer-facing solutions and solid bottom-line financials, we will strive to provide strong market leadership and stockholder value as we enter decade number three. Financial overview For fiscal year 2002, we are reporting earnings of $191.4 million. This represents a 7% decrease compared with fiscal year 2001. We made changes to our reporting structure, moving some of our products into new categories that more accurately reflect their usage by our customers. Adobe’s Creative Professional revenue was $351.3 million, an 11% decrease over fiscal year 2001. Digital Imaging and Video revenue was $411.9 million, a 6% decrease. Sales of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper® solutions application revenue from $291.9 million to $312.5 million, an increase of 7% over fiscal year 2001. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined from $104.8 million to $89.0 million, a decrease of 15%. During fiscal year 2002, gross margins were 91.0%, compared to 93.4% in fiscal 2001. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were 21.1%, compared to 18.2% in 2001 — a reflection of Adobe’s commitment to continue to invest in its future. Sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, as a percent of revenue, were 32.7% and 9.3% respectively — essentially at the same levels in 2002 when compared to 2001. Thanks to our ongoing financial discipline, we once again end the year in a solid financial position, with $617.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Highlights and partners Fiscal year 2002 was marked by several highlights. Accelerating our reach into the enterprise was our April acquisition of Accelio. The company’s electronic forms offerings provide the foundation of our newest ePaper solutions, and we anticipate that the acquired expertise in selling into the enterprise should be a major asset moving forward. We introduced several server-based applications, including Adobe® Document Server, which automates document 
production and delivers targeted, secure, and reliable electronic documents to virtually any platform a business or government agency may require. Within the design community, Adobe InDesign 2.0 software gained more customers among publishers and creative agencies worldwide. This version of our next-generation page layout software incorporates several innovative new features to deliver a top-notch application. Since its release in January, InDesign 2.0 has gained significant market share. In April, we released a new version of Adobe Photoshop software to widespread acclaim. And professional videographers working with corporate and broadcast video continued to make Adobe Premiere® and Adobe After Effects® software leaders in their category on the Windows® platform. Software collections, bringing together several flagship Adobe applications for specific customer requirements, continued to do well. Offering a complete solution, these suites allow customers to adopt multiple Adobe applications simultaneously at a great value. Licensing of Adobe Collections by our customers continues to represent a significant portion of Adobe’s revenue. In fiscal year 2002, our partnerships became more strategically important. Of particular note is our agreement with enterprise software provider SAP. By integrating Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) technology with SAP solutions, this partnership is an important step toward establishing Adobe as an essential enterprise infrastructure provider. Other important relationships include those with Dell and Documentum. Corporate governance At a time when investor confidence is being tested, Adobe is committed to closely following all newly established rules, certifications, and board independence requirements, and we will continue to conduct our operations with integrity. Focus and strategy Adobe’s focus for the coming fiscal year is threefold: to extend our business to the enterprise by developing and delivering enterprise-class ePaper solutions, to provide more value to our creative professional customers, and to extend our digital imaging and video businesses to meet the needs of home and business users. Underlying each of these goals is the evolution of Adobe PDF as a robust, rich media container that complements other established standards such as the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The use of Adobe PDF as a format for reliable, multiplatform communications spans all of Adobe’s customers, including creative professionals, businesses, and government agencies. No other technology today can equal what Adobe PDF provides, and we intend to continue to innovate its functionality—including extending it as a container for delivering digital photographs. For the enterprise, we are extending our Adobe Acrobat software-based ePaper solutions to help corporations, government agencies, and other large organizations move from paper-based workflows to electronic document-based workflows. Leveraging our reach through the now ubiquitous Acrobat Reader, ® we are delivering end-to-end, client- and server-based solutions that help enterprises both save and make money. To support these goals, we are refocusing our direct sales force to sell directly to executives, line of business managers, and IT managers.
We’re also giving increased attention to creative professionals, developing powerful tools that allow them to do their jobs more efficiently, creatively, and at a lower cost. Whether working in the creative departments of large enterprises or as independent professionals, these demanding power users depend on Adobe products to help them create the visually rich content found in newspapers, magazines, on television, on the Web, and in marketing communications of all kinds. Besides continuing to improve the industry-standard applications that are found in nearly every creative professional’s toolbox, we plan to offer newly designed software collections with greater integration and interoperability for enhanced creative workflows. Lastly, Adobe stands to benefit from the explosive trend of home and business users migrating from analog to digital photography and video. For these customers — including photography enthusiasts, home users, educators, and office workers in charge of producing corporate videos and internal Web sites— we’re rolling out applications designed to help them master the world of digital expression. In addition to a new version of our well-received Adobe Photoshop Elements software, we recently released Adobe Photoshop Album software. This new Adobe software will help people organize and share their digital photos. We’re also developing a new professional tool for video authoring that creative professionals can use to deliver rich media on a new, portable broadband platform: DVD. An anniversary and a birth We consider this year to mark not only a twentieth anniversary, but also a birth ; with solid solutions developed and key partnerships established, we are emerging as a key competitive player in the enterprise. The following pages of this Annual Report will show you how we are working to deliver robust solutions that help enterprises communicate better with their employees, their customers, and their business partners. As we take our mission to help people communicate better into the enterprise, we are determined to uphold the values that make Adobe Systems a great company in every sense of the word. We plan to continue to invest heavily in research and development, creating innovative products and services that meet our customers’ diverse needs. We remain committed to seeking out, hiring, and retaining the most creative employees in the industry. And we are proud of our community involvement: our community relations department sponsors a variety of programs to benefit our local communities, including software donations, cash grants, and volunteer efforts. We’re excited about the next twenty years, and are committed to serving our customers, employees, and you, our valued stockholders.

Adobe Inc.,ADBE,Info Tech,2003,"When we think of the word “platform,” several concepts come to mind: a strong foundation, a launching pad, an elevated vantage point. Those of you who have followed technology for the last couple of decades have seen several examples of companies that provide foundational platforms on which customers and partners can build their businesses and add value. This year we took a look at the way our own customers have standardized on Adobe software and solutions and came to an inescapable conclusion: Adobe has transformed itself into a platform company.
Not that long ago, Adobe was a company thought of almost exclusively in terms of its products. Today, we provide a foundation of innovative technologies on which our customers can be more creative, save time and money, and run their businesses more efficiently. We’ve built these foundations in three areas: Intelligent Documents, design, and digital imaging. Within each of these domains you’ll find Adobe software tools—as well as complementary technologies from partners—that help our customers share ideas, information, and memories. Together, these platforms represent the foundation of our success in the present and the launching pad of our vision for the future. For our customers, our partners, and you, our stockholders, they also represent a firm place to stand. Financial performance Fiscal year 2003 was an excellent year for Adobe Systems. With one of the strongest new product lineups in the company’s history, and more stable global economic conditions, we met or exceeded Wall Street expectations in every quarter in fiscal 2003. In addition, we grew our annual revenue to a record $1.295 billion, representing an 11 percent year-over-year growth when compared with fiscal 2002. Our diluted earnings per share increased from $0.79 to $1.10, and our operating profit margin expanded to more than 29 percent for fiscal 2003. Reported net income from all market segments reached $266.3 million, a 39 percent increase when compared with fiscal 2002. Adobe’s Creative Professional revenue was $368.5 million, a 5 percent increase over fiscal 2002. Digital Imaging and Video revenue was $392.4 million, a 5 percent decrease year over year. Licensing of Adobe Acrobat® software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper® Solutions application revenue from $312.6 million in fiscal 2002 to $444.1 million in fiscal 2003, a 42 percent increase year over year. Finally, revenue from our OEM PostScript® and Other segment was $89.7 million, a 1 percent increase when compared with fiscal 2002. Due to strong operational cash flows and cash proceeds from stock options, our cash position grew significantly in 2003. Our strong cash position of nearly $1.1 billion provides the flexibility to both invest in our future and continue to return cash to our stockholders through repurchase and our quarterly stock dividend. And by investing approximately 20 percent of our revenue in research and development, we are able to stay at the forefront of the markets we serve. From sales and engineering to marketing and finance, we’ve achieved a level of operational excellence uncommon 
in the software industry. And, as befits a major software company, we’ve kept our business processes streamlined and accountable. Further, we have deployed centralized information systems that provide real-time financial information to quickly assess our business performance throughout the world. Ethics and integrity have always been an important part of both Adobe’s culture and our way of doing business, and we take corporate governance very seriously, seeking to achieve the same level of excellence as we do in all other aspects of our business. A foundation for success We successfully executed the strategy that we outlined for you last year. As promised, in our fastest growing business, ePaper Solutions, we helped enterprises and government agencies migrate their legacy paper-based workflows to electronic document workflows. With the release of Adobe Acrobat 6.0, we not only delivered a strong product, but also segmented the product line to meet a broader set of customer needs: Acrobat Professional for demanding collaborative environments such as the creative professional segment and engineering, Acrobat Standard for working with Adobe PDF across the enterprise, and Acrobat Elements for basic Adobe PDF creation on the desktop. With this strategy we achieved record revenue for this powerful application— in the third quarter alone, Acrobat desktop revenue exceeded $100 million. We also further extended our Intelligent Document Platform to deliver document services that help connect people to back-end enterprise systems. Allowing large organizations to customize their outbound communications, Adobe Document Server software filled out our offerings for document generation. By making Adobe PDF forms interactive, Adobe Document Server for Reader Extensions delivered document collaboration and electronic forms capabilities to corporations and government agencies around the world. In all of our enterprise initiatives, we differentiated ourselves from the competition by concentrating on the ways that people work with information and business processes, rather than only on the ways that machines talk to other machines. For our creative professional customers, we fulfilled our promise to add value by delivering the Adobe Creative Suite. With this revolutionary platform, we combined new versions of all of our flagship software products—including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe GoLive®—with Version Cue,™ an innovative file management feature, to form a complete solution that allows creative professionals to work in newly efficient, collaborative workflows. Moving forward, we expect that all of the standalone products that are part of the Adobe Creative Suite, as well as the Suite itself, will be updated simultaneously, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and a streamlined product development cycle. Also of note in the creative professional space is the increased adoption of InDesign software as the page layout application of choice for major newspapers, publishers, and advertising agencies. By delivering enhanced creative freedom, an integrated workflow, support for rich media including video, and an ecosystem of service providers and partners, we’re seeing increased adoption of InDesign in this competitive space. Users of our digital imaging and video software took advantage of several new and important product releases. Digital imaging hobbyists wanting to use the professional power of Adobe Photoshop found tools to retouch, organize, and share their photos in Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album software. With these products, we shared our leading digital imaging platform with a broader range of customers than ever before. Similarly, video professionals gained a complete solution with the release of the Adobe Video Collection, which brings together several leading Adobe digital video products. At the core of the collection is an entirely rewritten version of Adobe Premiere,® now called Adobe Premiere Pro. With newly improved performance and enhanced capabilities, this video editing tool is poised to lead the market. The collection also includes a major upgrade of Adobe After Effects, as well as two new professional-grade applications: Adobe Encore™ DVD for DVD production and Adobe Audition™ for sound editing. What comes next Just as Adobe has transformed itself into a company that delivers platforms rather than tools or products, our customers’ businesses and markets are transforming in significant ways. By maintaining our strong relationships with our customers, we will anticipate and meet their evolving needs. In the enterprise space, we see the XMLbased interchange of information moving from the pilot phase to everyday reality. To that end, all of our enterprise solutions will incorporate robust XML support in the form of “Intelligent Documents.” By combining Adobe PDF with XML, these documents connect people, systems, and processes in innovative ways. In fact, what used to be called the Adobe ePaper Business Unit is now known as the Intelligent Documents Business Unit. With more than half a billion copies of Adobe Reader distributed on all major operating systems and devices, along with the fact that Adobe PDF has become the de facto standard format for the delivery of electronic documents, our customers have an unmatched platform from which they can reliably interact with information. As broadband and various new access devices continue to proliferate, creative professionals will be called on to repurpose rich media content at an accelerated rate. In the largest production environments, they will also have to manage tens of thousands of digital assets while attempting to streamline workflows. With the Adobe Creative Suite design platform, we help our customers accomplish these demanding imperatives. For example, our new Version Cue technology helps ensure that workgroups of all sizes can work on highly complex, asset-intensive projects collaboratively. And when it comes to Adobe InDesign, we continue to see increased adoption, solidifying our position as the page layout and design solution of choice for users who are eager to make the switch from non-Adobe applications. In 2003, sales of digital cameras surpassed sales of traditional film cameras, and by the year 2005, it’s expected that 100 percent of video cameras sold will be digital. Our strategy for taking advantage of this opportunity with our digital imaging platform is threefold. First, we will strengthen the leadership of the gold standard for desktop digital imaging, Adobe Photoshop. As we evolve the application’s features to match the next generation of digital photography, we plan to increase market share among influential new customers, including professional photographers. Second, we will continue to extend Photoshop technology to a rapidly growing number of hobbyists and consumers. As these users grow to desire more sophisticated capabilities, they will find a smooth upgrade path from Photoshop Album and Photoshop Elements to the full version of Photoshop. Finally, we expect to provide more market-leading digital video tools—not only for creative professional customers looking to expand their skill sets, but also for video producers within corporations and large organizations who are moving from analog to digital production. Moving forward Although Adobe has transformed itself into a platform company, our essential strategy has not dramatically changed. We plan to move forward in our key growth markets, using the power of our technology platforms to meet the needs of customers, effectively leverage an ecosystem of partners, and provide more value to stockholders. As always, we’ll continue to focus on our customers’ perspective, incorporating their input into the way we plan for and develop solutions. And, just as we have for more than twenty years, we’ll count on Adobe innovation as the stimulus for new revenue streams. For Adobe, being a model employer and responsible corporate citizen has always been an important part of creating stockholder value. We’ve been recognized for many years as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” by FORTUNE magazine, and we’re especially proud to be listed in the number six position in the 2004 report. By inspiring our employees to contribute at peak performance and share in the success of the company, we’re ensuring a steady rate of innovation and growth. We’re also contributing to our communities and helping to improve the quality of life by addressing critical needs, primarily through schools and nonprofit organizations that reach underserved populations in areas where Adobe employees live and work. Being a platform company means more than just setting industry standards. It means helping people and businesses communicate better by helping them integrate information, images, and insights. They can do it with the power of Adobe’s innovative technologies, tools, products, and services, and they will do it in new and paradigm-shifting ways over the coming years. Thank you for supporting our efforts, and for standing next to us in this exciting time.

In addition, we grew our annual revenue to a record $1.295 billion, representing an 11 percent year-over-year growth when compared with fiscal 2002. Our diluted earnings per share increased from $0.79 to $1.10, and our operating profit margin expanded to more than 29 percent for fiscal 2003. Reported net income from all market segments reached $266.3 million, a 39 percent increase when compared with fiscal 2002. Adobe’s Creative Professional revenue was $368.5 million, a 5 percent increase over fiscal 2002. Digital Imaging and Video revenue was $392.4 million, a 5 percent decrease year over year. Licensing of Adobe Acrobat® software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper® Solutions application revenue from $312.6 million in fiscal 2002 to $444.1 million in fiscal 2003, a 42 percent increase year over year. Finally, revenue from our OEM PostScript® and Other segment was $89.7 million, a 1 percent increase when compared with fiscal 2002. Due to strong operational cash flows and cash proceeds from stock options, our cash position grew significantly in 2003. Our strong cash position of nearly $1.1 billion provides the flexibility to both invest in our future and continue to return cash to our stockholders through repurchase and our quarterly stock dividend. And by investing approximately 20 percent of our revenue in research and development, we are able to stay at the forefront of the markets we serve. From sales and engineering to marketing and finance, we’ve achieved a level of operational excellence uncommon 
in the software industry. And, as befits a major software company, we’ve kept our business processes streamlined and accountable. Further, we have deployed centralized information systems that provide real-time financial information to quickly assess our business performance throughout the world. Ethics and integrity have always been an important part of both Adobe’s culture and our way of doing business, and we take corporate governance very seriously, seeking to achieve the same level of excellence as we do in all other aspects of our business. A foundation for success We successfully executed the strategy that we outlined for you last year. As promised, in our fastest growing business, ePaper Solutions, we helped enterprises and government agencies migrate their legacy paper-based workflows to electronic document workflows. With the release of Adobe Acrobat 6.0, we not only delivered a strong product, but also segmented the product line to meet a broader set of customer needs: Acrobat Professional for demanding collaborative environments such as the creative professional segment and engineering, Acrobat Standard for working with Adobe PDF across the enterprise, and Acrobat Elements for basic Adobe PDF creation on the desktop. With this strategy we achieved record revenue for this powerful application— in the third quarter alone, Acrobat desktop revenue exceeded $100 million. We also further extended our Intelligent Document Platform to deliver document services that help connect people to back-end enterprise systems. Allowing large organizations to customize their outbound communications, Adobe Document Server software filled out our offerings for document generation. By making Adobe PDF forms interactive, Adobe Document Server for Reader Extensions delivered document collaboration and electronic forms capabilities to corporations and government agencies around the world. In all of our enterprise initiatives, we differentiated ourselves from the competition by concentrating on the ways that people work with information and business processes, rather than only on the ways that machines talk to other machines. For our creative professional customers, we fulfilled our promise to add value by delivering the Adobe Creative Suite. With this revolutionary platform, we combined new versions of all of our flagship software products—including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe GoLive®—with Version Cue,™ an innovative file management feature, to form a complete solution that allows creative professionals to work in newly efficient, collaborative workflows. Moving forward, we expect that all of the standalone products that are part of the Adobe Creative Suite, as well as the Suite itself, will be updated simultaneously, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and a streamlined product development cycle. Also of note in the creative professional space is the increased adoption of InDesign software as the page layout application of choice for major newspapers, publishers, and advertising agencies. By delivering enhanced creative freedom, an integrated workflow, support for rich media including video, and an ecosystem of service providers and partners, we’re seeing increased adoption of InDesign in this competitive space. Users of our digital imaging and video software took advantage of several new and important product releases. Digital imaging hobbyists wanting to use the professional power of Adobe Photoshop found tools to retouch, organize, and share their photos in Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album software. With these products, we shared our leading digital imaging platform with a broader range of customers than ever before. Similarly, video professionals gained a complete solution with the release of the Adobe Video Collection, which brings together several leading Adobe digital video products. At the core of the collection is an entirely rewritten version of Adobe Premiere,® now called Adobe Premiere Pro. With newly improved performance and enhanced capabilities, this video editing tool is poised to lead the market. The collection also includes a major upgrade of Adobe After Effects, as well as two new professional-grade applications: Adobe Encore™ DVD for DVD production and Adobe Audition™ for sound editing. What comes next Just as Adobe has transformed itself into a company that delivers platforms rather than tools or products, our customers’ businesses and markets are transforming in significant ways. By maintaining our strong relationships with our customers, we will anticipate and meet their evolving needs. In the enterprise space, we see the XMLbased interchange of information moving from the pilot phase to everyday reality. To that end, all of our enterprise solutions will incorporate robust XML support in the form of “Intelligent Documents.” By combining Adobe PDF with XML, these documents connect people, systems, and processes in innovative ways. In fact, what used to be called the Adobe ePaper Business Unit is now known as the Intelligent Documents Business Unit. With more than half a billion copies of Adobe Reader distributed on all major operating systems and devices, along with the fact that Adobe PDF has become the de facto standard format for the delivery of electronic documents, our customers have an unmatched platform from which they can reliably interact with information. As broadband and various new access devices continue to proliferate, creative professionals will be called on to repurpose rich media content at an accelerated rate. In the largest production environments, they will also have to manage tens of thousands of digital assets while attempting to streamline workflows. With the Adobe Creative Suite design platform, we help our customers accomplish these demanding imperatives. For example, our new Version Cue technology helps ensure that workgroups of all sizes can work on highly complex, asset-intensive projects collaboratively. And when it comes to Adobe InDesign, we continue to see increased adoption, solidifying our position as the page layout and design solution of choice for users who are eager to make the switch from non-Adobe applications. In 2003, sales of digital cameras surpassed sales of traditional film cameras, and by the year 2005, it’s expected that 100 percent of video cameras sold will be digital. Our strategy for taking advantage of this opportunity with our digital imaging platform is threefold. First, we will strengthen the leadership of the gold standard for desktop digital imaging, Adobe Photoshop. As we evolve the application’s features to match the next generation of digital photography, we plan to increase market share among influential new customers, including professional photographers. Second, we will continue to extend Photoshop technology to a rapidly growing number of hobbyists and consumers. As these users grow to desire more sophisticated capabilities, they will find a smooth upgrade path from Photoshop Album and Photoshop Elements to the full version of Photoshop. Finally, we expect to provide more market-leading digital video tools—not only for creative professional customers looking to expand their skill sets, but also for video producers within corporations and large organizations who are moving from analog to digital production. Moving forward Although Adobe has transformed itself into a platform company, our essential strategy has not dramatically changed. We plan to move forward in our key growth markets, using the power of our technology platforms to meet the needs of customers, effectively leverage an ecosystem of partners, and provide more value to stockholders. As always, we’ll continue to focus on our customers’ perspective, incorporating their input into the way we plan for and develop solutions. And, just as we have for more than twenty years, we’ll count on Adobe innovation as the stimulus for new revenue streams. For Adobe, being a model employer and responsible corporate citizen has always been an important part of creating stockholder value. We’ve been recognized for many years as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” by FORTUNE magazine, and we’re especially proud to be listed in the number six position in the 2004 report. By inspiring our employees to contribute at peak performance and share in the success of the company, we’re ensuring a steady rate of innovation and growth. We’re also contributing to our communities and helping to improve the quality of life by addressing critical needs, primarily through schools and nonprofit organizations that reach underserved populations in areas where Adobe employees live and work. Being a platform company means more than just setting industry standards. It means helping people and businesses communicate better by helping them integrate information, images, and insights. They can do it with the power of Adobe’s innovative technologies, tools, products, and services, and they will do it in new and paradigm-shifting ways over the coming years. Thank you for supporting our efforts, and for standing next to us in this exciting time.

Adobe Inc.,ADBE,Info Tech,2008,"To our stockholders:
2008 was an eventful year for Adobe, for the U.S., for the entire world. Despite a global financial crisis and a broad economic
downturn, Adobe delivered another year of solid growth. We continued to execute against our strategy. We launched innovative
new products. And we remained focused on our mission to revolutionize how the world engages with ideas and information.
Highlights of 2008 include the launch of Adobe® Creative Suite® 4, the largest software release in Adobe’s history. We also
unveiled Adobe Acrobat® 9 and an update to Adobe LiveCycle® ES software, a combination that increased demand for our enterprise
solutions. We introduced exciting advances in the Adobe Flash® Platform, the leading technology for video, games, and interactivity
on the web. In addition to these product-related highlights, we expanded and deepened relationships with customers and partners
worldwide, reached out to our communities, and achieved another year of record financial results.
Just as the economic and political landscape is changing, the consumer and technology landscape is also evolving. The world
is moving from single-screen to multiscreen media consumption as people are demanding a consistent experience across
multiple devices—from their TV to their computer monitor to their mobile device. Success for our customers hinges on their
ability to deliver multiscreen experiences that build a meaningful and lasting connection with the person on the other side of
the screen. And that is why Adobe remains committed to our vision of enabling the most compelling applications, content, and
video—on screens of every size, across operating systems, accessible from anywhere at any time.
2008: Steady growth continues
Despite the uncertain economic environment, Adobe delivered double-digit revenue growth for the sixth consecutive year.
Fiscal year 2008 revenue was $3.58 billion, a 13% increase from fiscal year 2007 revenue of $3.16 billion. In addition, Adobe’s
annual net income grew to $871.8 million in fiscal 2008, compared wit
date, the Creative Suite 4 family includes 6 editions, 13 point products, 14 integrated technologies, and 7 services. With new
levels of integration and expressiveness for our Adobe Flash technology across the entire product line, the Creative Suite family
continues to be the industry-leading design and development software for virtually every creative workflow.
We also introduced groundbreaking advances in our Adobe Acrobat family of products that help knowledge workers share
their ideas and collaborate more effectively. Among the many new features in the latest release, Acrobat 9 delivers native
support for Flash technology, the ability to unify a wide range of content in rich PDF Portfolios, and access to real-time
collaborative capabilities for sharing a PDF document with colleagues. It also works with Acrobat.com, a new set of hosted
services, to provide unprecedented levels of collaboration online.
In addition, we released a new version of Adobe Acrobat Connect™ Pro software, our comprehensive web conferencing and
eLearning solution. The new version includes functionality that enriches online communication and collaboration, helping
organizations and schools provide high-impact rapid training, interactive virtual classes, and dynamic online meetings.
Our update to Adobe LiveCycle ES enables enterprises, government agencies, and other organizations to more effectively
engage customers, constituents, partners, and employees in key business processes—inside and outside the organization.
Among the many enhancements, LiveCycle ES Update 1 adds new components for rapid development of content-rich
applications, automated conversion of two- and three-dimensional CAD design data to PDF, and new Adobe Solution
Accelerators to help customers expedite deployment of enterprise applications.
In the burgeoning market for Software as a Service (SaaS), Adobe is on the cutting edge with offerings such as Acrobat.com,
Photoshop.com, and Scene7®. We are even making it possible to develop applications online, using our SaaS version
of LiveCycle, LiveCycle ES Developer Express.
In 2008, we announced further advancements to the Adobe Flash Platform, a complete system of integrated tools, frameworks,
clients, and servers to develop video, content, and web applications that run consistently across operating systems and devices.
The Flash Platform development tools, tightly integrated with Creative Suite 4, offer the foundation for agile design and
development workflows, making it faster and easier for creators to create, developers to deliver, and companies to profit.
To improve deployment of applications created with Flash, we’re continuing to drive innovation in our nearly ubiquitous client
software. Released in 2008, the Adobe Flash Player 10 runtime introduced new capabilities in 3D graphics, publishing-quality
text, audio, custom filter effects, and other advances. Adoption has been swift—Flash Player 10 was installed on more than
55% of computers worldwide in just the first two months of its release, far outpacing the installation rate of previous versions
of the software.
Flash technology has also solidified its position as the number one format for video on the web. Worldwide, Flash Player is on
over 98% of connected computers and delivers more than 80% of web video [Source: December 2008 data from independent
research firm comScore].
In the mobile market, handset manufacturers have shipped more than 800 million devices equipped with Adobe Flash Lite®
technology, and we will reach over 1 billion devices with Flash in the first half of 2009. With smartphones that can offer
computing power comparable to personal computers, and new Internet-enabled devices hitting the market every day, there
is great opportunity in providing a consistent runtime environment across desktops, mobile phones, televisions, and other
consumer electronics devices. We believe that Flash Player and its companion runtime, Adobe AIR®, are the logical choice for
this consistent runtime environment. With the Open Screen Project, we’ve partnered with leaders in the mobile, desktop,
and device ecosystems for the purpose of enabling consumers to engage with rich Internet experiences seamlessly across
any device, anywhere.
These are just a few of the innovative products, technologies, and partnerships Adobe announced in 2008 that will help
our customers create and deliver compelling content and applications more effectively than ever before. As cultural and
technological trends demonstrate, people want to interact with peers, brands, and companies—and the content they
deliver—in more meaningful and dynamic ways. Adobe is well positioned to meet these expectations with solutions that
spark creative endeavors, improve organizational productivity, enable efficient collaboration, and engage the hearts and
minds of customers around the world.
Corporate social responsibility: Adobe makes an impact in the community
Since Adobe was founded, a commitment to community involvement and philanthropy has been among the company’s
core values. A highlight for Adobe in 2008 was the formal introduction of the Adobe Foundation, created to leverage Adobe’s
human, technological, and financial resources to drive social change and improve the communities in which we live and work. 
Our extensive corporate giving programs benefit a wide variety of causes, from supporting education to reducing hunger and
poverty. We are particularly proud of our global signature philanthropy program, Adobe Youth Voices, which provides youth in
underserved communities with the critical skills they need to become active, engaged members of their communities and the
world at large.
Driven by a strong belief that corporations have a responsibility to their local communities and the global environment,
Adobe has consistently taken a proactive approach to resource conservation, waste reduction, environmental protection,
and sustainability. At our San Jose headquarters, for example, we’ve implemented more than 60 projects to drastically reduce
the use of electricity, natural gas, and water. As a result, Adobe is the first organization to earn five Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) certifications by the U.S. Green Building Council, and the only company in the world to receive
four Platinum certifications. Also, Adobe recently launched an environmentally sensitive redesign of its software packaging that
combines recyclable cardboard derived from sustainably managed forests, a die-cut production method and folding inserts to
minimize glue, and reduced size and fewer inserts to limit materials use.
We are very proud of our employees, who are demonstrating our values through a variety of individual and group volunteer
efforts that are making a positive impact in cities around the world. We thank the entire Adobe team for their commitment to
making our company the best it can be, and doing the same for the global communities and constituencies we serve. Moreover,
we’re proud that employee satisfaction continues to be high; for 2008, we had the honor of being recognized as the 11th best
company to work for in the U.S., according to FORTUNE magazine’s 12th annual “100 Best Companies to Work For” survey.
Looking ahead to 2009, we expect challenges. And with challenge comes opportunity. As we’ve done in the past, Adobe will
continue to focus on executing against our strategy and strive to fulfill our mission of revolutionizing how the world engages
with ideas and information. "

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2002,"Fellow Shareholders: On behalf of the 68 thousand Xerox people around the world, I am pleased – no, thrilled – to report that we have gone a long way to restoring Xerox to good financial health and positioned our company for a period of growth and opportunity. If I sound bullish on Xerox, it’s because I am. We have weathered the most serious crisis in our history and emerged a company that is stronger, different and better – a company prepared and resolved to take Xerox to new levels of greatness. Doing What We Say We Will Do Perhaps most importantly, we believe we have begun to earn your trust. A year ago we made a series of commitments to you. And we have already made good on most of them. We said we would improve liquidity and we did. Last year we generated operating cash flow of $1.9 billion. Since the end of 2000 we have reduced total debt by $4.4 billion. And we ended the year with $2.9 billion cash on hand. We said we would begin to drive equipment sales and we have – by making 2002 our biggest new product year ever. Equipment sales declines have moderated substantially in each of the last five quarters. That’s a very encouraging trend and a key part of our strategy. Equipment sales not only add revenue today, they add to our profitable post sales revenue stream tomorrow. We said we would improve our gross margins to the high ‘30s and we exceeded our commitment. Our gross margins in 2002 were 42.4 percent. Some of that improvement was reinvested as price decreases for our customers.
We said we would drive selling, administrative and general (SAG) costs down and we have. We reduced SAG costs by six percent last year and implemented actions under the Turnaround Program which will reduce our total cost base by $1.7 billion. We said we would return Xerox to full-year profitability and we did. After absorbing $670 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, we were able to report a return to profitability in 2002. All of our major operations were profitable for the full year. Over the past two years, we have reduced costs, improved liquidity, stabilized our business, strengthened our business model, invested in our future and laid out a plan to return to growth and to provide value for our shareholders. But all of us at Xerox are keenly aware that last year’s accomplishments are yesterday’s news. The task before us now is to harness our momentum and take Xerox to the next level of greatness. We are well on our way. Opportunities For Growth Xerox has three strong opportunities for growth over the next several years. There is, of course, the production market which we lead and which is growing at about two percent a year. It is expected to reach $39 billion by 2006. Within that market, digital production color – where Xerox has a commanding lead – is growing much more rapidly at more than 30 percent per year. A strong array of systems and solutions – led by the Xerox DocuColor® iGen3™ digital production press – promises to dramatically expand the market opportunity for Xerox. There is every reason to expect that we can grow faster than the market as a whole by driving the “new business of printing” in areas such as one-to-one marketing and print-on-demand. Early customer response to our new generation of color production technology has been very encouraging. Our second opportunity is in the office – a market that is relatively flat, but very large at $52 billion a year. Xerox is entrenched in the office and we are competitively advantaged in segments of the market that are growing the fastest. Three examples: color in the office, digital multi-function devices and value-added office solutions and services. 
As this report goes to press, we will be introducing new technology for the office – products and services that will further expand our fleet of worldclass offerings. They will include new solutions, a new family of black and white multi-function products, and color printers. And our third opportunity is in the services market which is growing at around 15 percent a year. This market includes knowledge, content and document management – areas where we have considerable expertise and resources. Our highly successful document outsourcing business gives us a strong base on which to build. More than 12,000 Xerox employees currently work on site in hundreds of customer offices around the world. They operate in-house printing and copying centers, and manage document workflow across the enterprise for our customers. More and more, these customers are turning to us for help in redesigning processes, improving productivity and strengthening customer relationships – all starting from our base of knowledge and expertise around the document. In aggregate, these three opportunities – production, the office and services – give us lots of room to run. We do not want for opportunity. We are engaged in three attractive markets where we can choose our sweet spots, add value for our customers, grow profitable revenue for Xerox and reward our shareholders for their investments. We estimate that over time these three markets will yield five percent a year revenue growth – even more if we are highly successful in areas such as digital production printing, color, high value solutions for the office and services. Our Vision For The Future If you think of Xerox as a world leader in office products like copiers and printers, you are only half-right. To be sure we have the broadest and deepest set of products in our industry – an arsenal of products that were substantially strengthened in 2002 and will be again in 2003. But that’s only part of the story. I spend a lot of my time – every opportunity I get really – talking to Chief Executive Officers and Chief Information Officers. I hear several common themes emerge over and over. They need to drive significant improvements in productivity. They need to access information quickly anytime, anywhere. They want to outsource parts of their business that others can do more effectively. They want to be able to market more effectively and to serve their customers more efficiently. Increasingly, these business leaders are turning to Xerox for help: • That’s why Bank of America asked Xerox to manage its fleet of 63 hundred digital multifunction devices and two thousand light lens copiers – a three-year contract worth over $50 million that will save money for the bank. • That’s why UnitedHealth Group called on Xerox to manage their extensive human resource records as they migrate to a paperless Internet world. Their twin goals are lower costs and improved customer satisfaction. • That’s why Lloyd’s TSB asked Xerox to manage seven digital print centers that form the heart of their marketing communications operations – at an annual expected savings of $10 million. In today’s economy, businesses and organizations of all sizes face the challenge of improving their performance or being overtaken by the tide of change -- whether it’s more effective communication with customers, leveraging what a company knows, exploiting the opportunity of new technology, or simply reducing costs and boosting productivity, improving results requires rethinking how work gets done. This is what Xerox does best. Our vision is both simple and powerful: “Helping people find better ways to do great work.” Since the introduction of the plain paper copier, Xerox has been about transforming the workplace. Through our worldclass research and technology; our expertise in printing and production; our skills and experience in content, document, and knowledge management; and our experience in process innovation, we serve as change agents, enabling customers to improve business processes and bottom line results. What Shareholders Can Expect It would not be an exaggeration to say that our performance last year has gone a long way to restoring both our health, 4 access information quickly anytime, anywhere. They want to outsource parts of their business that others can do more effectively. They want to be able to market more effectively and to serve their customers more efficiently.

Our vision is both simple and powerful: “Helping people find better ways to do great work.” Since the introduction of the plain paper copier, Xerox has been about transforming the workplace. Through our worldclass research and technology; our expertise in printing and production; our skills and experience in content, document, and knowledge management; and our experience in process innovation, we serve as change agents, enabling customers to improve business processes and bottom line results. What Shareholders Can Expect It would not be an exaggeration to say that our performance last year has gone a long way to restoring our health, our credibility and our confidence. We’ve also made good progress in the past year on corporate governance: • We have adopted strict new guidelines on what constitutes director independence. Applying this definition, 75% of our Directors are independent. • We have proactively integrated Sarbanes-Oxley and proposed NYSE rules into our governance processes. • We have revised and strengthened the charters for our Board of Directors’ committees. • We hold regular executive sessions of outside directors without Xerox management present. • We launched a massive effort to strengthen internal controls, train our people and promulgate a clear and strong Code of Conduct. • We established an Ethics Helpline for our employees and have taken other measures all aimed at making Xerox a role model in ethical behavior. • And, of course, in June we brought Larry Zimmerman on board as new Chief Financial Officer. Going forward, here is what shareholders can expect from Xerox and from my management team. First, credibility. We made a lot of commitments a year ago. We’ve delivered and we’ve executed. My intention is to continue to earn your confidence and to give every ounce of my energy to that end. When we say we’ll do something, we will. You should expect no less. We will deliver no less. Second, communication. We’ll be open, honest and accessible and we’ll build an environment that encourages communication with the investment community – freely, openly and often. To enable you to make the wisest investment decisions, you should have the information you need about the company as quickly as practicable. My objective is to make sure you have it. Third, leadership. In two ways. In the market through technological and market leadership. But also in terms of our people and our culture. As good as we are today, we will be better tomorrow. You have no interest in a company that isn’t leadership in every way. Neither do I.
Fourth, decisiveness. I’ll set clear direction for our people. I’ll hold people and businesses accountable. There will be no sacred cows. If a product development program falters, we’ll end it quickly. If a business isn’t profitable and has no credible plan to become profitable fast, we’ll shut it down. If we see an opportunity, we’ll grasp it. Decisiveness in planning and speed in execution will become hallmarks of the Xerox culture. Fifth, execution. We will continue to introduce competitive technology, to drive costs down, to streamline our business, and to execute against our business model. To ensure that we are best in class in every aspect of our business, we have introduced Xerox Lean Six Sigma – a powerful set of tools that will drive improved results. Our investors put a lot of faith in us. I take that very seriously. And I insist that all our people do as well. We have too much opportunity in front of us to fail. I’m excited by the challenges and so are our people. And we’re eager to give you a good return on your trust. All of us at Xerox firmly believe that our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you for the confidence you have placed in us. Our collective task at Xerox is to earn that confidence and to give you a good return on your investment.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2003,"Fellow Shareholders: It is with enormous pride in our people that I am able to report to you that 2003 was another year of good progress, excellent execution and accelerating marketplace momentum for Xerox. Everywhere you look the signs are positive. Take a look at the charts accompanying this letter. We generated near record amounts of cash from operations, significantly reduced both debt and cost, maintained gross margins and recapitalized the company. Even more importantly, we brought to market an expansive armada of innovative technology and services, gained market share in key segments of our business, grew equipment sales by 7 percent and won scores of large customer contracts – many of them in direct face-offs with our best competitors. Across the board and around the world, we did what we said we would do in 2003 – and then some.
In many ways, the curtain has closed on the Xerox turnaround. But we are keenly aware that most great plays have two acts. As pleased as we are with our performance the past few years, we know that it has merely set the stage for what is to come next – a period of growth and greatness for Xerox and for Xerox shareholders. We are already busy creating that future. Fortunately, we do not want for opportunity. I spend a lot of time with our customers – every chance I get. And every time I do, I come away bullish on our prospects for growth. Chief Executive Officers and Chief Information Officers have some very common and critical problems: the need to reduce costs and boost productivity, the desire to get closer to their existing customers and attract new ones, the need to make sense of a dizzying array of new technologies, and an almost desperate desire to optimize their investments in technology and make sure that technology is working for them and not against them. And whenever I hear those customer needs, I know that Xerox is part of the solution. Let me give you three examples of how we are helping our customers deal with their most pressing business problems: • In more than 200 blue-chip companies, Xerox has done rigorous Office Document Assessments to understand document workflows. We are saving these customers an average of 30 percent of their document costs and streamlining their processes as well. • In a growing list of marketing companies, our digital printing solutions are enabling our customers to communicate with their customers more effectively. We are helping hundreds of our customers find what up to now has been the elusive Holy Grail of marketing – the ability to communicate with large customer bases with one-to-one precision at just the right time with just the right information, while eliminating the need to maintain inventories of marketing materials that quickly become obsolete.
• In global enterprises around the world, we are helping our customers maximize their investments in information technology and helping them make document-intensive work processes more efficient, more impactful and more user friendly. Companies like Microsoft, Lloyd’s, Sun Microsystems and Siemens have turned to Xerox for help. I could go on, but you get the point. The “copier giant” has transformed itself into a leading technology and services company – with an important twist. Too many organizations focus on the wrong side of information technology – putting too much emphasis on the “technology” and not enough on the “information.” With smart document management services, we’re helping our customers focus more on the information and ideas captured in documents than on the technology needed to produce them. A case in point is the work we are doing with a major airline. We are helping them manage their documents so that they structure their own content, automate their own distribution and approvals, track sign-off by the right person, retire documents to a central repository, and provide reporting statistics to management. That’s what we mean by smart document management. It’s also smart business. The process reduces the risk of delayed flight departures and arrivals, practically eliminates the likelihood of a bad compliance report by the FAA, and saves them three-quarters of a million dollars a year. We have continued to invest heavily in research and development and to focus that investment on helping our customers find better ways to do great work. Even in our darkest days, we never considered mortgaging our future. What a hollow victory it would have been to save the company from financial failure only to suffer the consequences of a technological drought. 
Over the last two years, we have brought to market some 38 new products as well as a rich portfolio of smart documentrelated services. These investments are already paying off. In fact, more than half of our equipment sale revenue last year – and 60 percent in the fourth quarter – came from offerings that were introduced in the past two years. That pace will only quicken in the years ahead. We not only continue to invest heavily, but we’ve also become very smart in focusing that investment on solving real problems that real people have in the real world. Last year we were awarded 628 patents to place us among a handful of leaders worldwide. These are not patents for the sake of numbers. One of the hallmarks of the new Xerox is a deep desire to be connected to the realities of our customers. And we work at it with a passion and pervasiveness that no other company in our industry can match: • More than 12,000 Xerox managed services employees currently work on-site in hundreds of customer locations around the world. • Our cadre of 350 senior executives have each accepted personal responsibility for at least one of our major accounts. • Our research labs regularly host customers for two-way communication exchanges. • Our product developers and engineers, as they are quick to tell you, spend more time in the field with our customers than at any time in our history. • And, of course, our unsurpassed field sales and service force of some 25,000 people worldwide are intimately involved with their clients on a daily basis. From top to bottom, Xerox people are tightly connected to our customers and their businesses. For us, it’s very personal. Our customers are not faceless names, but real people with aspirations and needs and dreams that we want to help them realize. As a result, we are focused on three areas where we can help them be more successful.
There is, of course, the $9 billion production market, which we lead. A strong array of systems and solutions – led by the Xerox DocuColor® iGen3® Digital Production Press – promises to dramatically expand the market opportunity for Xerox. As you will see elsewhere in this report, our new generation of digital technology and services expands our market opportunity three-fold. We are driving the New Business of Printing™ in areas such as one-to-one marketing and print-on-demand. Early customer response to our new generation of color production technology has been very encouraging. By year’s end, we had installed more than 125 DocuColor iGen3 presses. Many customers are buying more than one. In fact, our leading DocuColor iGen3 partner already has a half-dozen. Our second opportunity is in the office, a market that is huge. Xerox is well established in this market and focused on segments that are growing the fastest – color, digital multifunction, and office services and solutions. Last year, we brought 15 new offerings to the office market – color and black-andwhite, printers and copiers, multifunction and services – at price points that are highly competitive. Our customers approved. We participated in more buying decisions than ever before – and we’re winning. Our third opportunity is in the services market, in which we are making significant inroads. Our customers – particularly our larger ones – are turning to us for help in designing and improving work processes that are document intensive. These include mining customer databases for one-to-one marketing applications, content management and retrieval, seamless integration of paper and digital documents and a host of other applications. Our successful document outsourcing business gives us a strong base on which to build. Three years ago we made a critical strategic decision – to place our investment bets on market segments that were growing the fastest, where our customers needed help and where we could add value. That meant putting our technology and innovation muscle and brainpower behind digital production, the digital office, color and value-added services. Last year, 70 percent of our revenue came from these areas and revenue from these segments grew 8 percent.
At the same time, we made another strategic bet. We substantially deepened and widened our distribution channels with an eye to reaching more customers in the way they want while reducing unnecessary costs to Xerox. Although our direct sales force is still one of our crown jewels, it is augmented by an equally effective network of agents, concessionaires, valueadded resellers, retailers and a worldclass TeleWeb operation. Xerox now claims the broadest and deepest set of offerings in our industry and the broadest and deepest network of distribution channels. It’s a winning combination. If I sound bullish, it’s because I am. We are in the right markets with the technology to expand those markets over time. We have the right offerings that help our customers find better ways to do great work. And we have the right business model which delivers both operational excellence and consistently improving performance. When I wrote to you last year, I said that one of our key priorities was to continue to establish credibility with you and to earn your trust. That is very important to all of us at Xerox. We now have a three-year track record of delivering on some very specific commitments. We have an attractive and predictable business model with a large recurring revenue stream. And we have strengthened and streamlined business processes that enable us to better manage our business with improved efficiencies. Just as importantly, we have a premium brand in the attractive and expanding $100 billion document market, a vast distribution network led by a global sales and service force that the rest of our industry only dreams about, worldclass technology and innovation fueled by leading labs and scientists around the world, a knowledge and savviness about our customers’ document needs that builds on a rich heritage and our passionate engagement with our customers, a focused strategy of investing for growth in markets where we can add value – and the enormous talent of 60,000 people in more than a hundred countries who are committed to success. 
As you might expect, the size of our opportunities and the soundness of our strategies has attracted some very tough competitors. We do not shrink from that challenge. It energizes us. All of us at Xerox believe our best days are ahead of us. And we believe just as firmly that the caliber of our competitors and the demands of our customers will only strengthen our resolve to execute tomorrow even better than we do today. Our 2004 plan is for flat revenue with margin and earnings expansion followed by a return to revenue growth, operating margin expansion, and continued earnings growth in 2005 and beyond. As the curtain goes up on our second act, all the pieces are in place to return Xerox to growth and greatness. We are confident but not arrogant, assured but not complacent. We constantly remind ourselves that the enemy of great is good. None of us at Xerox wants to be just good enough. We are on a road whose destination is nothing short of greatness. You should expect no less; we aim to deliver no less. We are keenly aware that you put a lot of faith in us. Earning your trust energizes us. We believe we have demonstrated consistency and credibility over the past three years. And we are determined to keep earning your trust in 2004 and beyond.

"
Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2004,"A s I write this letter, I am enormously proud of what Xerox people have accomplished over the past few years; galvanized by the opportunities we see immediately ahead of us; sobered by the demands of the marketplace and the strength of our competitors; and humbled by the trust you have placed in us. Our goal is to give you a good return on that trust – and that’s precisely what we are all hard at work doing. Proud of Our Accomplishments Over the past four years, we believe we have put together a rather remarkable track record. We have just about cut our debt in half, more than doubled our equity, taken $2 billion out of our cost base, strengthened our offerings, expanded our distribution channels, articulated a clear vision for the future, made the right strategic investments, and consistently increased earnings – building value for our shareholders. Our progress in 2004 provided more evidence that we are on the right track and building strong momentum: • We brought 40 new products to market – products that set new industry standards for the creation of customer value and which garnered some 230 industry awards. • We were granted 525 utility patents in the United States alone – a sign that our best days are ahead of us. • Sales, administrative and general (SAG) costs declined to 26.7 percent of revenue – the lowest in years. • Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. • We reduced debt by another $1 billion. • And we ended the year with a cash balance of $3.2 billion. The charts that accompany this letter tell the story of a company that has returned to good financial health. We deliver consistent predictable results. We do what we say we will do. We also realize that as good as we are today, we must be even better tomorrow. So rather than simply rehash the past, I want to take this opportunity to share our plans for the future. Poised for Growth As the story of the Xerox turnaround gets written, I’m confident that it will say that while we were focused on reducing costs, boosting productivity and slashing debt, we were equally focused on implementing a strategy for growth, investing in our future and creating value for our shareholders. That strategy starts with spending a lot of time with our customers. Many companies preach that; we practice it. Someone just figured out how much of my own time I spend with our clients. The not-so-surprising answer is about 25 percent. All of my senior team maintains an equally aggressive schedule of customer engagement. We estimate that some 80 percent of our people have regular contact with our customers. And one in five of our people work on site in our customers’ places of business. Why? Because we’re keenly aware that it takes five times as much effort and money to attract a new customer as it does to keep an old one. Even more importantly, we know that if we listen to our customers – really listen – they will tell us what we need to do to be successful. What we learn permeates all our decisions. And what we’ve learned is that our customers don’t simply want our products – at least that’s not how they express their needs.
They want our help in reducing costs, improving productivity, growing revenue and creating value for their customers. That’s exactly what we’re helping them do. In more and more accounts, large and small, we are becoming strategic partners. The copier and hardware company has morphed into a technology and services enterprise. Four years ago, we made a series of critical strategic decisions on where to invest. We used three simple but profound criteria – areas of our market that were growing the fastest, areas where our customers were telling us they needed help and areas where we already had core competencies on which we could build. We let go of businesses where we couldn’t make money in the short term, or articulate a credible plan to make money in the long term. That freed up resources for investment in three critical areas of the document market – the digital office, digital production and value-added services. That’s where we placed our strategic bets. We’re glad we did. Last year, three-quarters of our revenue came from these businesses and revenues from these areas grew 6 percent. For the first time in five years, growth in our strategic areas of focus, including the effects of favorable currency, offset declines in older technology and other non-strategic businesses. Now, we are positioned for growth in 2005 and beyond. Here’s why. Leading The Digital Revolution in the Office In the digital office, we’re concentrating our investments on the key growth areas of color, digital multifunction and office services. We continue to expand our portfolio of products at price points that are highly competitive. As a result, we are participating in more and more buying decisions. One way we create value for our office customers is through our Office Document AssessmentSM. A recent industry report indicates that two-thirds of all businesses have initiatives in place that are aimed at reducing the cost of document management. You might think that’s a threat to us; we see it as an opportunity. Until recently, the costs of documents flew under the radar screens of most Chief Information Officers. Once digital technology put documents on the network, that dramatically changed the way document management is viewed. With the help of Xerox, more and more CIOs are recognizing that they can simultaneously reduce costs and improve workflows. Using Xerox Lean Six Sigma methodology, we analyze in detail all of the documentintensive processes our customers use to run their businesses. We identify the exact costs of the way our customers manage printing, copying, faxing and scanning functions. Perhaps even more importantly, we analyze the way real people work with real documents in the real world. We estimate that a typical business spends up to 5 percent of its revenue on documents. We can save 20 to 40 percent of that while improving productivity, speed and worker satisfaction. The opportunity for Xerox is substantial and we are being very aggressive about seizing it.
Building the New Business of Printing The second area in which we are investing is the digital production market. Our strong array of digital systems and solutions – led by the Xerox iGen3® Digital Production Press and augmented by the highly acclaimed Xerox Nuvera® family of products – promises to dramatically expand our market opportunity. Market response to our new generation of color production technology has been very encouraging. Increasingly, our commercial print customers are relying on the iGen3 to fuel their business growth. In fact, many iGen3 customers own multiple systems – some own six or more. We are driving the New Business of Printing® in areas such as one-to-one marketing, print-on-demand, and on-demand book publishing. One example is a large retail customer who maintains many bridal registries. After the couple returns from their honeymoon and settles into married life, they receive a special sales promotion of all the products they had selected for their registry but didn’t receive. The brochure is printed on a Xerox iGen3. Direct mail experts consider a 1-percent response to be quite good. This promotion runs about 40 percent. That’s the power of one-to-one marketing – power we bring to our customers. Digital production printing is a huge market opportunity for Xerox as more and more customers see that they can augment traditional offset printing and penetrate new markets with new applications that create new revenue streams. It’s the ultimate win-win-win – for Xerox, for Xerox customers and for their customers. Leading With Value-Added Services The third area in which we are investing is value-added services. Here, too, we are making a great deal of progress. In fact, revenue from our value-added services business grew 20 percent last year and 25 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago. More and more, our customers – particularly our larger ones – are turning to us for help in designing and improving work processes that are document intensive. We provide consulting, imaging, content management and outsourcing services that help our customers reduce costs through processes that deliver the right information, in the right form, at the right time. Although we manage our business in three areas, we go to market as one Xerox. The umbrella for much of what we do – the value we provide – is something we call Smarter Document Management™. Just about every organization you can think of has made significant investments in information technology over the past several years. In fact, between 1997 and 2003, United States companies alone invested an estimated $2.5 trillion in the promise of information technology. Many are still looking for the return. They are realizing that more is not necessarily better. Xerox is uniquely positioned to help our customers leverage and streamline their legacy investments and make wise investment decisions going forward. Since our earliest days, we have been on a mission to harness the marvels of technology to the needs of people. We take a holistic approach that considers the way people work, the culture they work in, the 
processes they work with, the objectives they strive for. In other words, we help our customers find better ways to do great work through the use of Smarter Document Management. It’s an area in which we are uniquely advantaged. These three market areas – digital office, digital production and value-added services – total more than $100 billion of market opportunity today. Advances in digital technology, many of them driven by Xerox, are likely to significantly expand the market size in the years ahead. We do not want for opportunity. The only thing that stands between Xerox and significant growth is execution. And that, fortunately, is entirely within our own control. It’s a good place to be. Shareholder Value Our Mantra If I sound optimistic about our future, it’s because I am. But don’t mistake optimism for hubris. All of us at Xerox recognize that we are in a race without a finish line. Our competitors are formidable and they are not standing still. Our customers are demanding that we stay on the leading edge of technology and services. Our shareholders are expecting us to deliver premium returns. We don’t shrink from these expectations. We embrace them. This generation of Xerox people has been tested. We’ve learned from our mistakes. At a recent town meeting, a Xerox employee asked me what our greatest strength and weakness was as I looked to the future. My answer: our greatest strength is our people – a highly motivated group of individuals who are committed to their customers, passionate about the success of Xerox and on a mission to drive shareholder value. And our weakness? That we start believing our own press, that we even subconsciously start to behave as though “good enough” really is good enough. That’s something we ferociously guard against. We’re building a culture that is problem curious, that abhors the status quo, that looks at every challenge as an opportunity to improve. All of you have put your trust in us – many of you at a time when others were writing our obituary. It’s something we will never forget. Ever. By the way, just about every Xerox person around the world is a shareowner. We are all in this together. We are all focused on creating shareholder value and we’re making good progress. Xerox’s share price increased 23 percent last year contributing to a three-year cumulative annual growth rate of 18 percent. We’re proud of that, but we also know that it’s yesterday’s news. We realize better than most how easy it is to lose our way. Avoiding that pitfall is what energizes us. We are all focused on a few simple objectives – focusing on our customers with precision and passion, growing revenue and improving profitability. If we do that well, we know we will create value for our shareholders and give you a good return on the trust you place in us. You should expect no less; we aim to deliver no less.



"
Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2005,"I am pleased to report another solid year of progress for Xerox. Our company is in excellent financial health. Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. Our new business model is doing what we intended: whatever the challenges of our business, we are able to adjust quickly and produce earnings growth. In fact, we have met or exceeded our earnings expectations in 13 of the last 14 quarters. Our global operations are producing significant cash flow. At the same time, we have virtually eliminated debt except for the debt that supports our customer financing activities. As a result of our performance as well as confidence that it will continue, the Xerox Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase $1 billion in Xerox common shares. It’s a tangible way to deliver shareholder value and to assure you that we take very seriously the trust you have placed in us.
Our progress in 2005 provided more evidence that we are on track and continuing to build momentum: • Net income of $978 million or 94 cents per share, an increase of 9 percent from full-year 2004. • Gross margins of 41.2 percent – in line with our expectations. • Selling, general and administrative (SAG) expenses of 26.2 percent of revenue – down one-half point from the previous year. • Debt balance of $7.3 billion, a reduction of $2.8 billion from year-end 2004 – and virtually all of what remains is in support of our customer financing activities. • Operating cash flow of $1.4 billion. • Year-end cash and short-term investments balance of $1.6 billion. Xerox is at a pivotal point. We get a lot of credit these days for turning Xerox around. We’re pleased by that, but hardly satisfied. All of our hard work these past five years has been done with a single-minded purpose – to return Xerox to growth, thereby providing value to our shareholders. We made progress in 2005, but not enough. We accelerated the pace of install activity for Xerox digital systems such as color printers, digital presses and multifunction devices that print, copy, fax and scan. In fact, activity increased by double-digit rates in our key markets. At the same time, we aggressively ramped our services business, winning more global consulting contracts for Xerox’s document management expertise. All of this bodes well for our long-term success: increased equipment installs drives more pages printed on Xerox systems. More pages fuel growth for Xerox supplies and service. This translates into “post-sale” revenue, which represents about 70 percent of Xerox’s total revenue. More multi-year contracts for Xerox’s document management services also flows through to support our annuity stream. Our post-sale revenue turned positive in the second half of 2005 – an important sign that our annuity-based business model is working. However, total revenue was flat, slightly below our expectations. We know we can do better and are confident we will. And that’s what I’d like to take this opportunity to discuss with you – how we will grow Xerox over the next few years.
We do business in a very attractive – and therefore very competitive – market that currently affords us a $112 billion opportunity. Parts of that market are stable, parts are growing rapidly, and parts are being created. In each, we have a clear, consistent and credible strategy. Simply put, it’s this: • Compete aggressively and effectively in the relatively stable $58 billion digital black-and-white printing market. • Drive the rapidly growing $17 billion digital color printing market, where the breadth and depth of our technology gives us a commanding competitive advantage. • Create a new $17 billion market by harnessing digital technology to the world of offset printing with applications such as print-on-demand, personalized communications and one-to-one marketing. We call it the New Business of Printing®. • Lead the burgeoning document services market by working with our customers to reduce document costs, streamline processes and enable the free flow of documents down the hall, cross-town and around the world. That’s the opportunity we’re attacking. It’s a blend of markets where we have traditionally competed and natural extensions of those markets – extensions that are enabled by new technology and inspired by the evolving needs of our customers. A question I’m often asked by investors is how Xerox believes it will win in this $112 billion market. It’s a fair question. When I reflect on it, I believe there are six tangible – and one intangible – reasons why Xerox will succeed. First, our technology – a past, present and future strong suit for Xerox. We routinely invest 6 percent of our revenues in research, development and engineering. Our research investments are closely aligned with our growth strategy; this way we’re always outrunning our competitors. For example, Xerox and our partner Fuji Xerox are jointly investing about two-thirds of our combined research and development budget on color. Over the last decade, this investment has resulted in more than 2,700 color-related patents. During 2005, we brought 49 new products to market – products that won more than 260 industry awards. In fact, fully two-thirds of our equipment sales last year came from products introduced in the past two years.
It’s fair to say that no other company has a broader or better set of offerings than Xerox. Perhaps more importantly, we remain committed to our ongoing investment in research and technology – investment that is yielding great returns. During 2005, the Xerox scientific community was awarded 643 patents, placing the patent portfolio in the top 25 of American companies. And, in 2005, we filed 60 percent more patent applications than in the previous year. This relentless focus on innovation assures us that we will be able to bring added value to our customers far into the future. Second, color. The demand for color in today’s world is great. Our response is straightforward – make it affordable and make it easy to use. That strategy has made us the revenue leader in a market that is expected to double by 2009. Color has rapidly become a business-critical tool for our customers. More and more businesses are shifting to digital color systems to produce personalized, colorful materials such as marketing collaterals, financial statements, catalogs and user guides on Xerox digital devices. The number of pages printed on Xerox color devices has doubled in the past two years. In fact, color now represents approximately 30 percent of our total revenue. The potential for color technology is as enormous as it is profitable. Two facts stand out: around 7 percent of the pages printed or copied on Xerox devices today are color, and color pages are five times more profitable than black-and-white. The combination presents us with a world of opportunity. We intend to capture it. Third, our superior knowledge of documents and the way people work with them. Ever since creating the plain-paper copier industry 50 years ago, documents have been part of the DNA of Xerox. We have research teams around the world that study the flow of documents in a workplace and develop smarter software and services that simplify this workflow. Our customers in industries such as health care, legal and manufacturing rely solely on Xerox to manage the huge volume of paper and digital documents that keep their businesses running. As we like to say, we know more about the document, care more about the document and can do more with the document than anyone in our industry. Period. That’s an enormous advantage as the document becomes more digital, more dynamic and more critical to the conduct of business. Heretofore, the substantial cost of documents flew under the radar screen of most Chief Information Officers and Chief Financial Officers. Everyone used documents, but no one was accountable for their management. That is rapidly changing and it plays to our expertise. We can save our customers up to 30 percent of their document costs. And we are. An increasing number of customers are turning to us to simplify their document-intensive work processes; manage their document-related assets; develop systems to easily store, search and retrieve digital files; and provide other services that add value. Fourth, our broadening portfolio of distribution channels. It includes 8,000 sales professionals, 7,000 agents and concessionaires, 10,000 resellers, a world-class teleweb operation, strong OEM relationships, IT and consulting partners – all backed up by industry experts and business analysts. It’s a critical mass of people and expertise that no one else can match. Those distribution and consulting resources span the world and give us a presence that global customers covet. Digital documents and business enterprises don’t stop at geographic boundaries. Neither does our ability to help our customers.
A growing list of global companies are turning to Xerox for help in managing their worldwide document needs. The Dow Chemical Company is a good example. They’ve signed a $66 million deal with us to consolidate all of their document assets – printers, copiers, fax machines and scanners – in 54 countries. Dow will get more technology at less cost, seamless integration around the world and the value of working with a global partner. We believe arrangements such as this are the wave of the future. You can read more about our relationship with Dow on page 10 in this report. Fifth, the customer-centric culture we have built and continue to strengthen. Our people recognize that the customer is our priority among priorities – the reason we exist. Some 12,000 of our people – that’s one in five – literally work every day on customer sites. We work with our customers, offering not just our products, but also providing solutions to the most pressing problems of our customers. The vast majority of our leadership team – including people such as our Chief Accounting Officer and General Counsel – have personal responsibility for the relationship with one of our major customers. Whenever I call on a customer – and that’s every chance I get – they tell me that the most important reason they do business with us is the caliber and commitment of our people. It’s a priceless asset. Sixth, the strength of our brand. We nurture it. We invest in it. And we know that it opens doors, gives us permission to compete for business and positions us as an attractive and trusted partner. One recent brand-building achievement is worthy of special mention. J.D. Power and Associates named Xerox the first document management company to receive its certification for excellence in customer service and support. J.D. Power evaluated the breadth of our on-site, phone and online customer service. In addition, auditors conducted several comprehensive visits to our call centers and surveyed hundreds of our customers. It’s quite an honor and one that will motivate us to strive for even higher levels of performance.
So there you have it – a half-dozen reasons that give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace and should serve to give you confidence that you have invested your money wisely. As I write this letter, I am gathered with the senior leadership team of Xerox – some 300 individuals whom I am proud to call my colleagues. They and the people they lead are the intangible reason I am confident we will continue to be successful. Most of the leadership team has been with the company through our most challenging times. Others were recruited to Xerox to fill gaps in our capabilities and provide leadership in key areas. All chose to be part of our turnaround, to be with us during the most difficult, yet most rewarding period in our history. They inherited a company that lost $273 million dollars in 2000, but had a noble history. And they brought it back to a company that made $978 million last year, adding another inspiring chapter to a storied past. They refused to let Xerox fail, exhibiting what I’ve come to call steely optimism in the face of enormous adversity. While others predicted failure, they said not on our watch. Xerox cannot and will not fail. They showed their True Colors. Now they are focused with an intensity that’s hard to describe, but easy to feel. They are writing another chapter in our history – the story of our return to growth. As I met and talked with the leadership team this week, I was galvanized by their dissatisfaction with the status quo. To them, good is not good enough. They are on a mission to put Xerox back on a growth trajectory and give you a solid return on the trust you place in us. As one of them put it: “We’ve been playing defense. Now it’s time to play offense.”
We’re proud of our accomplishments, but not satisfied. We’re confident in our strategy, but not complacent. We’re bullish on our future, but take nothing for granted. Because our opportunities are large, our competition is formidable. As we get better, so do they. As we deliver value to our customers, they expect more. As you invest in us, you anticipate greater returns. We do not shrink from those expectations; we embrace them. They are an opportunity to continue to show our True Colors. This is a management team that has been tested by adversity and sharpened by challenge. We’re going after a $112 billion opportunity. We’re competitively advantaged to attack it aggressively. Our financial health enables continued investments to keep us on the leading edge of our markets. Our business model is tested and flexible. We adapt to changes in the marketplace, holding steady on our gross margins and increasing earnings for our shareholders. Our leadership team and our people are aligned around a common set of objectives aimed at delivering shareholder value. You should expect no less. We aim to deliver no less. Because of our people, I believe our best days are ahead of us – just ahead.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2006,"“I am pleased to report that 2006 was another year of good progress for Xerox. The strategic investments we made several years ago are paying off and we are confident in our continued ability to give you good returns on the trust you have placed in us.”
We met our full-year expectations on earnings growth and cash generation, increased post-sale revenue and strengthened our industry-leading portfolio of products and services. We purchased two well-performing companies – XMPie® and Amici – that are contributing revenue growth and helping us build value for our customers. We managed our operations efficiently, giving us the flexibility to compete effectively while generating strong bottom-line results. We returned to investment grade and bought back $1.1 billion of Xerox shares in 2006. We’ve committed $2.5 billion to share repurchase since the program launched in October 2005. Our healthy cash position allows us to deliver value for shareholders by buying back stock and investing in growth through acquisitions, innovation and a services-led approach to winning in the marketplace. In fact, Xerox stock appreciated 16 percent in 2006. It was a good year and we have every reason to believe we are on our way to a better one. Our growth strategy While we’re proud of our accomplishments, what gives me the greatest pride in our leadership team is that we’re not satisfied. Hubris is not a part of our vocabulary. Good enough is simply not good enough for Xerox. We’re keenly aware that the last frontier we need to tame is accelerating revenue growth. There are several reasons to believe this is within our reach. While we’re justifiably known for our technology, we’re running an annuity-based business that generates more than 70 percent of revenue from what we call “post sale.” This is the sale of supplies – like ink and toner – and technical services that are needed to support our products, as well as revenue from financing our customers’ purchases. It also includes consulting and outsourcing services such as document imaging and archiving, managing our customers’ print shops, simplifying their work processes and much more. Last year was a turning point in growing our post-sale revenue – up 2 percent for the year – as the annuity from our digital, color and services businesses helped to offset losses from our older light lens business. This positive trend is expected to continue; in fact, we expect it will accelerate as light lens becomes less and less of the total and the annuity from our strong growth markets kicks in. We have four planks in our growth strategy. Each builds on our core competencies. Each responds to customer need with customer value. Each is designed to fuel our annuity stream through long-term contracts. And each is yielding good results. Here’s a snapshot of how we’re doing in each of our four growth strategies. The first is to lead in color. We’ve been investing heavily in leading with the transition to color in the office and in expanding our leadership position in the production market. Last year we brought eight new color products to market, strengthening what was already the broadest and deepest set of technologies in our industry. We’ve already announced five more color products this year and we’re just getting started. The competition doesn’t stand still and neither do we. The power of color is in the pages. Color pages generate significantly more revenue and profit than black-and-white pages. We’re already seeing this benefit flow through to our annuity. Post-sale revenue from color was up 16 percent in 2006. Much of that is due to the 38 percent increase in color pages. More than 30 billion color pages were printed on Xerox color systems last year; that’s close to double what we were doing two years ago. Color now represents nine percent of total Xerox pages. As that percentage grows, so too will our all important post-sale revenue stream. It’s a great business model and it’s working. Our second strategic platform for growth is what we call the New Business of Printing. ® It’s a market where Xerox is competitively advantaged. Our customers in this space are typically commercial printers, marketing and graphic arts companies and large enterprises. They depend on digital printing to print on demand, produce short runs of books, personalize documents as they come off the press and leverage the power of our digital technology in a myriad of other ways. Our digital presses, sophisticated workflow capabilities and expanding set of solutions and applications help our customers grow their businesses. New products helped drive a 74 percent increase in installs of Xerox’s production color publishing systems and printers – that’s actual placements in a customer’s workplace. We closely track install data as an indicator of what’s to come in post-sale revenue. The more color products we sell, the more pages printed on Xerox systems. More pages mean more profitable annuity, all adding up to sustainable growth. One especially satisfying trend: the acceptance of the Xerox iGen3® Digital Production Press, our flagship and unparalleled product that creates up to 110 full-color impressions per minute with the ability to personalize each and every one. The iGen3 is a winner with our customers. In fact, some 180 customers now own more than one. And, about 70 of our customers’ iGens produce more than 1 million images per month. Last year we acquired XMPie for $54 million. XMPie provides software that enables multimedia campaigns with personalized e-mail, Web sites, catalogs, brochures and other documents. When applied to direct marketing campaigns, these capabilities significantly increase standard response rates and open up new ways for marketing professionals to communicate with their customers. You’ve probably received marketing materials in the mail that are targeted to your personal buying needs – like postcards from car dealers with an image of the new version of your car including a license plate with your initials or a travel itinerary from a cruise line featuring activities that appeal to your individual interests. These marketing campaigns cut through the clutter. They’re personalized, colorful and most likely printed on Xerox color systems using XMPie software. The market for variable data jobs that capture individual information such as name, address, account information and photographs is projected to grow from 49 billion pages in 2004 to 138 billion pages in 2009. That’s an annual compounded growth rate of 23 percent. Xerox is in the forefront of driving that market opportunity. Our third strategy for growth is to lead in services in our major accounts – and here, too, we’re making good progress. Our services signings last year were up over 15 percent from the previous year. Customers who are entrusting us to manage large enterprise systems include the likes of Medco and Honeywell, the University of Calgary and Microsoft, OfficeMax and United Technologies and more.
And we believe it’s the tip of the iceberg. More and more large customers are turning to us for help in simplifying their document-intensive work processes; bridging the divide between paper and digital documents; managing their infrastructure; and creating digital systems that allow them to easily store, search and retrieve their digital files. We call this Smarter Document Management™. It’s a market where Xerox is uniquely advantaged – drawing upon our heritage in understanding how people work with documents and adding our rich portfolio of digital applications and technology. During 2006, we acquired Amici LLC for $175 million. Amici is the market leader in e-discovery technology, which involves the identification, filtering, production and storage of relevant data from paper or electronic documents, such as e-mail, text files, memos, databases, presentations and spreadsheets. Projected to grow at an annual compounded rate of close to 40 percent, e-discovery services could be a nearly $2.5 billion market in the United States alone by 2009. Now a part of Xerox Litigation Services, Amici helps position us to go after this burgeoning market. The fourth plank in our growth strategy is to aggressively attack the small and medium business (SMB) market. It’s a $44 billion opportunity where our presence has been modest. Segments of the market, however, are growing – especially in developing countries, in color and in multifunction devices. Here, too, we are making excellent progress. Last year we introduced four products targeted to this segment and earlier this year we launched seven more. At the same time, we continue to expand our distribution channels. We recently announced our most significant investment in resellers and independent agents since launching these sales channels several years ago. That means there will be more “feet on the street” selling Xerox systems and services and greater Xerox brand visibility in the SMB market. Our strategy is straight-forward: more technology plus more distribution equals more growth. We’re attacking a $117 billion market opportunity through our focus on these growth strategies. We can compete for every dollar of it – and we are. Our people Our success is dependent on contributions from Xerox’s 54,000 worldwide employees who impress me every day with their passion for creating great experiences for our customers. They’re led by a deeply committed executive team with a fierce will to win. We have a wealth of talent across our enterprise and spend significant time developing this talent – spreading that wealth throughout our operations and preparing our next generation of leadership. Our recent appointment of Ursula Burns to president of Xerox and a member of the Board of Directors reflects this commitment. Ursula joined Xerox in 1980 as an engineering intern and earned her stripes through product development and business division management roles to her most recent position as head of Business Group Operations with full responsibility for Xerox’s research and product groups through to manufacturing and distribution. She’s been instrumental in fine tuning Xerox’s business model so we’re more cost competitive, and accelerating our time to market with the launch of more than 100 products in the last three years. Ursula now brings her deep knowledge of our business to the president role, where she’ll work closely with me and our leadership team to aggressively drive our well-defined growth strategy. With a lot of heavy lifting behind us, our operations are in good shape. We’re now well positioned – with the best people and best products and services – to build on our momentum in the marketplace both in the near term and for your long-term investment in Xerox. Our innovation Including our partner Fuji Xerox, we invested a combined $1.4 billion last year in research and development, with a similar amount planned for 2007. Our returns on that investment are excellent. Last year we launched 14 products that together earned 208 industry awards. We expect to more than double the number of product announcements this year. We measure the success of our R&D investments through a metric called “Time to Revenue” – how long it takes for new ideas to become new revenue. We believe our progress in this area is among the best in the industry. About two-thirds of Xerox’s equipment sales come from products launched in the past two years. Thanks to our scientists and engineers, the future is bright as well. Last year, the Xerox innovation community received nearly 560 U.S. utility patents. That’s up 24 percent over the previous year. With our research partner, Fuji Xerox, the total was over 800. We hold more than 8,000 active patents, many that are the foundation of breakthrough technology like: • Self-erasable paper that uses a combination of light and ink to automatically erase marks on a page about 16-24 hours after the page is printed. • E-Agent, a special chemical ingredient that reduces the amount of energy needed to make certain Xerox toners by up to 22 percent. • Advancements in natural language search technology which uses familiar phrases and sentences to simplify search results. Our customers One of the hallmarks of the new Xerox is deep relationships with our customers. Increasingly, we are strategic partners. One of them recently referred to Xerox as a combination painkiller and steroid. We’ve been called lots of things, but never that, so I asked him what he meant. His answer went something like this: “Before Xerox came along, document management was a huge headache. We had no idea what we were spending. We had lots of vendors but no partners. We kept investing in the promise that the next new thing would be the right thing. Xerox has made my life simpler. I talk to one person who saves me money and boosts my productivity. That’s the painkiller. The steroid part comes from leveraging documents to reach customers more effectively, to make it easier for customers to do business with us and to grow our business. That’s the steroid part. Xerox gives me both in ways no one else can.” That’s music to my ears. It’s also a novel way to express our value proposition – painkiller and steroid, streamlining document processes to reduce costs and leveraging documents to grow revenue. No one does that better than Xerox – no one. Our operations We also have a business model that works – in part because it’s flexible. We react quickly and decisively to marketplace challenges and opportunities. In today’s world, every quarter seems to present its own unique dynamics. Pricing pressures may put pressures on our margins. Economic slowdowns may slow our revenue pipeline. Competitive threats may cause us to bulk up our investments in marketing. Whatever the circumstances, we adjust. We do it quickly. And we do it in a way that keeps our business model aligned with our financial objectives. As a result, we are a company that is known for consistency. We know that’s important to you so it’s critical to us.
Our commitment to citizenship So, too, is our continued focus on being a good corporate citizen. It’s a cherished part of our heritage and an essential part of our future. I urge you to read the snapshot description of our activities in this report. We’re making progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We supported more than 500 non-profit organizations; spent more than $370 million with minority-, women- and veteran-owned businesses; strengthened our efforts to protect our forests; sent thousands of volunteers into the communities in which we work and live; and much more. Last year, we published our first Report on Global Citizenship. It provides a comprehensive look at how we run our company – from serving our customers and taking care of the environment to conducting our business with integrity and giving back to our communities. The report is available in its entirety at www.xerox.com/citizenship. Our commitment to you We believe our track record is good, our strategy is sound and our business model is robust. We’re participating in a $117 billion market and we’re positioned to compete aggressively for every dollar of it. In 2007 you’ll see continued activity that strengthens our leadership in color, accelerates the New Business of Printing, expands our offerings in services, and broadens our offerings and distribution in the small and medium business market. All this fuels our profitable annuity stream, which accounts for more than 70 percent of our revenue. At the same time, you can expect us to remain diligent on reducing costs, generating cash and prioritizing profitability and earnings growth. We know that you have invested in Xerox because you have confidence in us. It’s an awesome responsibility that we embrace and take very seriously. The thing I love the most about this company is the people. They have what I like to call a “steely optimism.” They do whatever it takes to make Xerox successful, to help our customers be successful and to give you a good return on your investment. Because of them, I have every confidence that 2007 will be another good year for Xerox – and for you.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2007,"I am pleased to report that 2007 was another year of steady and solid progress – a year in which we continued to strengthen the company financially, invest in growth, and win in the marketplace.
Our results included: á Net income of $1.1 billion. á Earnings per share of $1.19, which compares to 2006 earnings per share of $1.22. On an adjusted basis, our earnings per share grew 13 percent in 2007*. á Operating cash flow of $1.9 billion. á Total revenue of $17.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 8 percent. Excluding the benefit of our acquisition of Global Imaging Systems, which we purchased in May last year, revenue was up 4 percent in 2007*. á Investments in strategic acquisitions totaling $1.6 billion. á And disciplined cost management that kept our gross margins and selling, administrative and general costs right in line with our business model. At the same time, we continued to take steps to build shareholder value. All the credit rating agencies rank us as investment grade. We reinstated a dividend. We repurchased $631 million in Xerox stock, bringing the total repurchased since 2005 to $2.1 billion. And, as we entered 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $1 billion of Xerox stock. We feel good about the state of our business. And, we know that consistently delivering double-digit earnings per share growth and strong operating cash flow make for the best long-term investment. It’s a value proposition we’re strengthening every day. 
The numbers, as they say, speak for themselves but they don’t tell the entire story. Turnarounds are easy to track and to talk about; transformations evolve more slowly and are harder to define. Over the past several years – step by step and brick by brick – we have built a new Xerox. I believe we are at an inflection point. We have evolved into a services-led technology company that is known for innovation and customer focus. We help manage the massive flow of information and communication in businesses today. We’re a content management provider and a trusted partner that can help our customers make the most of their IT infrastructure and bridge the paper and digital worlds. The Xerox once known for copiers, printers and paper has greatly expanded its footprint. New technology and services offerings are generating billions of dollars in recurring revenue for us. We’ve made some critical strategic bets in the past few years that are now differentiating Xerox in the marketplace and fueling our growth. We invested heavily in color, determined to be the market leader. We coined the term “The New Business of Printing” and vowed to bring digital technology to what was largely the province of offset or lithographic printing. We also invested in technology and distribution to aggressively attack the office market and expand the business we do with small and mid-size companies. And we vowed to become a services-led partner in large enterprises. I’m not given to exaggeration or hyperbole, but I feel strongly that we have achieved considerable success on all four fronts.
Accelerating the adoption of color We’ve led the transition to color from top to bottom across the markets we serve – color that’s both the highest quality and highly affordable. Last year, more than 40 billion pages were printed on Xerox color systems. That’s an increase of 31 percent over 2006 and way ahead of our competitors. In fact, according to estimates by InfoTrends, a leading independent research firm, Xerox accounts for half of the total worldwide color pages printed by high-speed digital systems. And, for us, the power really is in the pages. We operate an annuity-based business with more than 70 percent of our total revenue coming from recurring revenue streams, what we call our “post sale.” This includes interest income from financing our customers’ purchases; service, such as technical support as well as consulting and outsourcing services; and supplies, like ink, paper and toner. The latter is why pages are so important to our business. Post-sale revenue from color pages was up 18 percent year-over-year, so we know the model is working. As that continues to grow, so will Xerox. Color now accounts for about 39 percent of our total revenue, but only 12 percent of our total pages (excluding the benefit of Global Imaging Systems) – indicating a tremendous growth opportunity that we’re well positioned to mine. Last year, we shook up the marketplace by launching an office printer that makes the cost of printing a color page as affordable as black and white. It’s the Phaser® 8860 and it uses our proprietary solid ink, cartridge-free technology, minimizing the impact on the environment. We announced 18 color products in 2007, strengthening what is already the industry’s broadest portfolio of digital color printing systems. Look for more worldclass color technology this year – technology that promises to widen our significant competitive advantage and generates the pages that boost our annuity. Last year, more than 40 billion pages were printed on Xerox color systems, an increase of 31 percent and way ahead of competitors. Our leadership in digital high-volume printing complements traditional offset printing. This market transition is The New Business of Printing. The opportunity for digital production printing is about $25 billion, and Xerox’s advantages are the ability to print on demand, produce short runs of books, and customize each and every document that comes off a digital press. In The New Business of Printing, the Xerox iGen3® Digital Production Press continues to be the star performer, but it has a great supporting cast. We’ve now installed more than 2,000 iGen3s around the world. Many customers – 126 to be precise – are printing more than a million pages a month on these market-making marvels. Perhaps the best testimony to their success is that 275 of our customers, many of whom run commercial print shops, have purchased at least two iGen3s and have seen their business soar by offering more digital printing capabilities. At the same time, we’re seeing accelerated demand for the high end of our DocuColor® series and the recently launched Xerox Nuvera® systems. We’re going after the continuous feed market with new technology that redefines the industry standards of speed and quality and gives us a competitive advantage. And we’re partnering with photo imaging companies to use Xerox technology for printing photo applications. In fact, if you order a photo calendar from a retailer that works with Fujifilm, the calendar will be printed on a Xerox press using Xerox paper. As Xerox leads advancements in quality for digital printing, the lines are blurring between the traditional photo imaging business and document processing. InfoTrends predicts the specialty photo printing market – that’s calendars, greeting cards and photo books – will grow at a rate of 24.5 percent per year through 2010, reaching $800 million. Xerox is well on its way to capturing a good share of this growth.
Expanding participation in small/medium businesses We also see great opportunity in the office market where we’re investing heavily to win. In 2007, we launched 29 office products that garnered 190 industry awards and broadened and deepened our offerings in this highly competitive market. At the same time, we acquired Global Imaging Systems, which immediately put some 1,400 new sales people on the street and brought more than 200,000 new customers into the Xerox fold. The acquisition has exceeded our expectations and then some. One year ago, this billion-dollar enterprise sold NO Xerox products. By year’s end, 50 percent of the document technology Global Imaging was selling carried the Xerox brand and it is getting better every month. In addition, much of Xerox’s 11 percent growth in developing markets has been fueled by small and mid-size businesses (SMB). We’ve been increasingly building a competitive portfolio of products and services that cater directly to the fast-growing SMB market. We’re making inroads with today’s small businesses that may be tomorrow’s large enterprises. Xerox wants to be with them every step of the way. 
Leading with services Perhaps the greatest transformation has been in our services business, which quietly has become an engine of growth. A few facts make the point. In 2007, the value of services signings was up 18 percent. Services generated $3.4 billion in annuity revenue – up 8 percent over the previous year. Some of the most prestigious enterprises in the world – brands as diverse as United Technologies, HSBC, NASA, EUROPART, The University of California, Raytheon Corp., the United States Navy, and many, many more – are turning to Xerox for help in simplifying work processes, managing their office technology around the world, helping them bridge the paper and digital divide and maximizing their investments in information technology. We’re constantly expanding our service offerings, especially targeting what we call “document-intensive” industries that generate lots of paperwork and digital files. Think health care, where filling out forms for each doctor visit is still the norm. Or, the legal industry, where documentation can make or break cases. All these documents, in any form, need to be managed – scanned, searched, stored and more. And that’s where Xerox’s expertise comes in. 
We like to say that no one knows the document better than Xerox. The ability to manage document-intense processes has opened doors to new business and new markets. And, it’s why we’re investing in acquisitions that further carve out our niche in this space. Last year, we acquired Advectis® Inc. and started Xerox Mortgage Services, which provides one of the mortgage industry’s most widely used solutions for sharing electronic documents. In 2006, we acquired Amici LLC and launched Xerox Litigation Services to become a leading provider of electronic discovery and document services that support legal and regulatory compliance. So just about everywhere you look there are proof points that our strategy is right, our execution focused and our momentum building. That said, Xerox shareholders and the management team share a common belief; as good as our progress has been, it’s now a part of our history. Yesterday’s accomplishments are only important insofar as they provide a bridge to tomorrow’s promise. Growing the business faster Accelerating growth in a competitive environment remains a priority. We’re not yet where we want to be. Key to expanding growth is expanding our distribution channels. It’s the area of improvement where I believe we can make more progress and where we are focusing considerable time, talent and resources. We’re advantaged with a rich portfolio of technology and services, the industry’s smartest experts in document management and a respected brand known around the world. We’re skilled at managing global accounts in big businesses and the commercial print market. But to really ratchet up growth, we need to reach even more potential customers in businesses of any size. Acquiring Global Imaging was a step in the right direction, as was giving our agents and resellers access to more Xerox products and packaged services to sell. We need to – and we will – take this to the next level now by broadening the availability of the Xerox brand through diverse direct and indirect channels. To do this well, we’re connecting even more closely with our customers, predicting and responding to their needs. It’s no secret that I spend a lot of time with customers. So does my entire team. Some of that time is spent fixing problems and some of it selling, but most of it is spent listening – really listening. And when you do that, you learn some pretty interesting stuff. The CEOs I meet with – and they are from a wide variety of industries and geographies – worry that they are not harnessing new technology to leverage growth and better serve their customers. They worry about escalating costs and where to place their IT investment bets so they stay ahead of the curve. They see an explosion of digital information in their enterprises, but are also confronted with a legacy of paper and don’t know how to make sense of it all. They understand the need for information to flow freely and easily throughout their organizations and around the world, but worry about security breaches. 
They’re eager to embrace the promise of a “greener” world, but don’t know how to harness technology to make their infrastructure more sustainable. They are awed by the complexity and potential of technology, but yearn for someone to make it all simpler and more effective. Here’s what excites me. In each of these areas – top-line growth and bottom-line productivity… bridging the digital and paper domains… making document management secure and sustainable… making IT decisions that provide good returns… and making a complex world simple – in all these areas Xerox has answers. Our innovation community is aligned with our strategy and is the best in our industry. Last year, Xerox was awarded 584 U.S. utility patents. Together with our research partner Fuji Xerox, we hold about 8,600 active U.S. patents and continue to invest $1.4 billion a year in research and development. In 2007, we were awarded the National Medal of Technology, America’s highest such honor. It’s a singular accomplishment for Xerox innovators past and present. Our product development community is bringing a steady stream of worldclass technology to market. In the past three years, we have brought more than 100 new products to market. Together with our intelligent software, targeted solutions and tailored services, they bring value to our customers today and assure us continued industry leadership tomorrow. Our distribution channels, already the broadest in our industry, are getting stronger. We have a powerful blend of direct sales people and indirect agents, concessionaires, resellers, dealers and Web-based channels. They have at their disposal a wide array of experts in color, production printing, solutions, software, services and more. Our reach is worldwide, providing a competitive advantage that is unique in our industry. We are on the ground in some 160 countries in every corner of the globe. That becomes increasingly important as our larger customers want help in designing, implementing and maintaining document networks and processes that span the world. Our annuity business model provides a consistent and profitable revenue stream that drives strong cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, more than 70 percent of our revenue comes from post-sale. In 2007, we grew post-sale revenue by 9 percent (6 percent excluding the benefit of Global Imaging*) and added more than $1 billion to our post-sale revenue stream.
And our leadership team is my personal pride and joy. It’s a terrific blend of seasoned Xerox veterans, some great additions from outside the company and some new leaders who have emerged from our own ranks. It’s a team that leads 57,400 Xerox people who consistently deliver on their commitments, have grown earnings in the 10 to 15 percent range, and are determined to do whatever it takes to be successful. It is a team that I am exceptionally proud to lead. Rest assured that we are hardly satisfied with what we have accomplished. We love change and hate the status quo. We embrace challenges and obstacles. We’ve developed a culture that I like to call “problem-curious.” We want to grow faster and win more, not by a little but by a lot. We pride ourselves on listening intently to our customers, connecting with them on a one-to-one basis and committing to finding them the right answer for their unique needs – not some of the time but all of the time. You’ll read more about just that in this report – how we listen, connect and are committed to you. Playing offense with high expectations and great opportunities Our performance in 2008 will be driven by growing our profitable annuity stream – fueled by color and services – and continued discipline in managing costs while generating significant operating cash flow. And, with our strong balance sheet, we’ll focus on share repurchase while being opportunistic in making acquisitions. We do business in a $125 billion market that has attracted a set of competitors we regard with great respect. We know that our customers have choices. We realize that the better we get, the higher our customers’ expectations will get. We are also proud but not content with our record on corporate responsibility. I invite you to read our second Report on Global Citizenship. It’s online at www.xerox.com/citizenship. You will see that we continue to invest in the communities in which we work and live, that our people are active and constructive participants in making our world better, that we have one of the most diverse workforces in the world and that we are a leader but hardly a newcomer in the fight for a sustainable world and a greener planet. This Annual Report to Shareholders is the first to carry our new brand identity, which we launched the first week of 2008. Companies often use new identities in an aspirational way – to signal what they want to become. Our launch is both a statement that we have already arrived at a new place and a promise that our journey continues. I truly believe that our best days are ahead of us. We are playing to our strengths, ushering in a period of great growth for our shareholders, our customers and our people. So, to sum it all up, here’s why I’m confident Xerox will increase value for you:
We operate a global business with about half of our revenue generated from customers outside of the U.S. From small and medium businesses and the public sector to large enterprises and commercial printers, we serve a wide range of markets – giving us diversification globally and in market scope. We’re an annuity-based business that continues to boost profitable recurring revenues. We’re an investment-grade firm that generates strong cash flow. We’re investing in our business and in our stock. All of us at Xerox are eager to play offense and to give you a good return on your trust. We’re listening, we’re connecting and we’re committed. We know that you, like our customers, have choices. You chose Xerox and we take that very seriously. You can be sure we will do whatever it takes to continue to earn your trust. That’s a promise.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2008,"Dear fellow shareholders: It will come as no surprise to you that Xerox shareholders have been negatively impacted by the economic crisis that has ricocheted around the world in recent months. Through three quarters of 2008, we were on the path to another year of solid performance. That trajectory changed dramatically in the fourth quarter. One example will make the point. Our developing markets organization was on track to deliver another year of doubledigit revenue growth. Through the first three quarters of 2008, revenue was up 17 percent. Starting in mid-November, the bottom fell out with breathtaking speed, resulting in a fourth-quarter revenue decline of 14 percent in our developing markets.
“Although we are hardly immune from the recessionary turmoil, we are better positioned than most to navigate through it.” Some of the sudden shift was due to a rapid decline in the Russian and Eastern European economies. But 11 points of the 14-point decline was due to major – some would say wild – shifts in currency in several developing markets.
Typically, we manage changes in currency through pricing, but this currency decline was so swift and so significant that pricing couldn’t catch up. I point this out not as an excuse, but as an illustration of the roller-coaster nature of this economy.
“The wonderful people I am privileged to lead at Xerox are focused with passion and grit on those things we can control. This attitude and focus helped us turn in credible performance in a very difficult year.”
Although we are hardly immune from the recessionary turmoil, we are better positioned than most to navigate through it. Our value proposition is supported by the strength of our financial position and the resiliency of our recurring revenue stream that is driven by installs of Xerox technology and multi-year contracts for Xerox services. More than 70 percent of our revenue and 80 percent of our cash flow is generated from our annuity-based business model, making for a solid and reliable asset, especially in tough economies. Last year, our annuity delivered $12.9 billion in revenue – up 4 percent from 2007 – and helped us generate more than $1.7 billion in adjusted cash from core operations* – or $1.36 per share in adjusted free cash flow.*
Given our cash flow, healthy cash balance – $1.2 billion at the end of 2008 – and a $2 billion credit facility, we remain quite confident in our financial position and have no need to access the capital markets in the foreseeable future. It’s certainly an advantaged position in this economy. Although we are keenly aware that there is much we cannot control, the wonderful people I am privileged to lead at Xerox are focused with passion and grit on those things we can control. This attitude and focus helped us turn in credible performance in a very difficult year: • Total revenue for 2008 was $17.6 billion – that’s an increase of $380 million, or 2 percent, over 2007. • Full-year net income was $230 million including a litigation charge. Excluding this and certain other charges, adjusted net income was $985 million.* • We generated $939 million of operating cash flow. Adjusted cash from core operations for the year was $1.7 billion.* • Through the 5 percent of our revenue invested in innovation, we continued to expand our portfolio of document management technology and services – already the broadest in the industry and in our history. • And we continued to expand distribution, bringing the Xerox brand to more businesses of any size all around the world. The proof points are everywhere. The highly respected Gartner organization lists us as a “Magic Quadrant” market leader in managed print services, as well as for printers and multifunction systems that print, copy, fax and scan all in one device. Our new offerings last year garnered some 230 awards from industry groups and media around the world. I could go on, but you get the point. Third parties are validating our progress and our leadership in virtually every aspect of our business. That’s all looking in the rear-view mirror. I don’t have to be a psychic to know that you have little patience for that – especially in these turbulent times. Neither do I. I’ve met with many investors in recent months and I keep hearing three questions asked over and over: • What are you doing to confront the recession right now? • What are you doing to make sure you come out of this crisis with a full head of steam? • Why should I continue to invest in Xerox? Fair enough. Let me answer each of those questions as candidly and succinctly as I can. “The highly respected Gartner organization lists us as a “Magic Quadrant” market leader in managed print services, as well as for printers and multifunction systems.” Actions to Minimize Impact of the Recession We are doing everything possible to reduce cost – everything that doesn’t mortgage our future. We took a $349 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 that has resulted in the elimination of about 3,400 jobs. We expect that the restructuring will deliver $200 million in savings this year.
2008 bonuses have been scaled back substantially and people on bonus plans will receive no salary increases this year. Expenses like training and travel have been significantly cut back. External hiring has to be approved by me personally. We’ve accelerated the consolidation of manufacturing facilities around the world, stopped the production of products made in very low volume, and consolidated operations wherever we can. We’ve realigned our support operations – including human resources, training, finance and marketing – to achieve better synergy at lower cost. We’ve streamlined product development and engineering by combining two product development organizations into one. So we are taking a long list of actions aimed at getting our expenses aligned with the realities of faltering economies in just about every corner of the globe. Our investments over the years in Lean Six Sigma have given us a set of tools and processes that simplify and reduce the cost of managing our global operations. For us, it’s not an event, but a way of life. The management team I’m privileged to lead is a seasoned group that knows all about belt-tightening and is eager to deliver the best possible shareholder value that conditions allow. You place a lot of trust in us. It’s something we take very seriously. Emerging with a Full Head of Steam At the same time, we are not mortgaging our future. We are continuing to invest for growth and we are continuing to stick to the fundamentals – starting with listening to our customers. One of the things I’m proudest of is the customer-centric culture we’ve developed at Xerox. We have a proven track record that demonstrates that our customers increasingly see us not as a vendor, but as a partner.
Our combination of document services, affordable and innovative color technology, and broader distribution to businesses of any size positions us exceptionally well to attack a $132 billion market. Here’s how: We provide document services that help businesses work faster and smarter with lower costs. Today businesses rely on us to help reduce their infrastructure costs by optimizing how they manage their document technology and handle enterprise-wide printing needs. Also core to our document services offerings is our expertise in converting paper to digital and helping customers seamlessly track, edit, share and save documents in any form. In a world where 15.2 trillion pages are printed each year and $650 billion in productivity is lost each year due to the overload of information, our ability to simplify the way work gets done helps customers save up to 30 percent on their document management costs. That’s a figure that is getting more and more attention as we speak to our customers these days, many of whom are looking for ways to contain cost and reduce paper. That may seem counter-intuitive coming from a company known for putting marks on pages, but it’s actually a sweet spot for us, especially in what we call “document-intensive” industries like legal, healthcare, financial services and education. Increasingly we’re partnering with IT services companies like CSC and HCL Technologies to integrate our strength in document management with their capabilities in managing enterprise-wide IT systems. And, we are the preferred global imaging partner for IBM Managed Business Process Services, a unit of IBM Global Technology Services. Under our worldwide agreement, we’re scanning and imaging millions of documents for IBM and their customers. We provide affordable color printing systems that cut through the clutter with high-impact communications. Xerox continues to benefit from making color printing affordable for businesses of any size. Revenue from color now represents more than 41 percent of our total revenue.
The billions of pages printed on Xerox color systems grew 24 percent last year, and total significantly more than any of our competitors. In fact, according to estimates by InfoTrends, a leading independent research firm, Xerox’s DocuColor®, iGen3® and iGen4™ presses accounted for approximately one-half of the total worldwide color pages printed by high-speed digital systems. With the broadest portfolio of color printing systems on the market, we continue to create new business opportunities in production printing through color technology and systems such as the Xerox iGen4™ Press and Xerox 700, both of which launched in 2008. This year we’ll shake up the industry even more with the introduction of a color multifunction system that breaks down the cost barrier of color printing in the office through exclusive solid ink technology, which not only lessens the impact on a business’ bottom line but also on the environment.
“One of the things I’m proudest of is the customer-centric culture we’ve developed at Xerox. We have a proven track record that demonstrates that our customers increasingly see us not as a vendor, but as a partner.” We have more distribution channels to bring Xerox’s technology and services to more businesses of any size, anywhere around the world. For decades, we’ve had the largest and best direct sales force in our industry. Currently it’s over 7,500 strong – one of our crown jewels and an asset that gives us a competitive advantage. That’s backed up by Global Imaging Systems, our wholly-owned and growing network of U.S. dealers, as well as an equally impressive partnership with agents, concessionaires, resellers and more – giving Xerox the largest, broadest and most professional distribution network in our industry. By acquiring nine office technology dealers in the last two years and launching 19 products in 2008 designed for small and mid-size businesses (SMB), we have significantly increased our penetration in the SMB marketplace. In fact, the number of installs for our desktop printers and multifunction systems grew 10 percent last year, largely due to more channels selling the Xerox brand. “Our recurring revenue stream represents more than 70 percent of our total revenue. That gives us some cushion in challenging economic times and helps fuel the $1.7 billion in cash that we expect to generate this year from core operations.”
Bottom line: yes, we are feeling the impact of the recession; yes, we are moving aggressively to reduce costs, generate cash and weather the storm; but no, we are neither giving up on 2009 nor mortgaging our future by compromising on investments that will give us momentum as we come out of the economic downturn. The Case for Xerox as an Investment We firmly believe that we will navigate through this set of challenges and emerge stronger than ever. I say that for several reasons. We continue to enhance our leadership position in document technology. Last year, Xerox inventors earned more than 600 U.S. utility patents. We currently hold more than 8,900 active patents in the U.S. and, together with our research partner Fuji Xerox, we have received over 55,000 worldwide patents in our history. Our research leadership yields the best and broadest set of offerings in our industry. Over the past three years, we have launched more than 80 products – including 29 new products last year with about the same number expected this year.
Our distribution and services capacity is also the best and broadest in our industry. Through our vast and growing network of direct sales, agents, resellers, Global Imaging partners and distributors, we do business in over 160 countries. This is a huge competitive advantage, as customers depend on us for global account management and increasingly want to move documents around the world with speed, ease and security. Our strategic bets in the marketplace are paying off in areas like color and document services. Color pages now represent 18 percent of total pages printed on Xerox technology, up from 12 percent in 2007. We lead the industry in the number of color pages printed. In services, we generated $3.5 billion in annuity revenue last year, a year-over-year increase of 3 percent. Our recurring revenue stream represents more than 70 percent of our total revenue. That gives us some cushion in challenging economic times and helps fuel the $1.7 billion in cash that we expect to generate this year from core operations. Our leadership team is battle-tested and results-driven. They are an unusual mix of Xerox veterans, new leaders who have recently emerged from the ranks and people who joined us from other leading companies. They are all driven by one goal – the success of Xerox measured by the value we deliver to our shareholders. Last but hardly least is the quality and dedication of our workforce. Together with our technology and our distribution, they provide the knowledge and the passion to bring value to our customers. When I visit customers, it’s our people they want to talk about. Customers sing the praises of Xerox people and want to talk about their focus on solving problems, their can-do attitude, and their desire to do whatever it takes to get the job done. At the end of the day, Xerox people spell the difference between failure and success. So we are feeling good about where we are. There is a fair amount of disruption in our industry – some of it brought on by the economy but much of it brought on by Xerox. Over the past few years, we have upped the ante considerably on the technology we have brought to market. We have both built and acquired new document services offerings. And we have expanded our distribution. We are proud of but not content with the competitive advantage we have created in our industry. We know it’s a never-ending battle but it’s one we’re eager to wage. We feel the same way about corporate responsibility. Even in the worst of times, we continue to make appropriate investments in the communities in which we work and live. We continue to be a leader in diversity in all its forms. We continue to fight for a sustainable world and a greener planet. We don’t have our heads in the sand about the challenges we face, yet we believe we are better positioned than most to meet the obstacles that 2009 will certainly bring our way. There are likely to be winners and losers when the dust finally settles. We feel confident we will be a winner.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2009,"Dear Fellow Shareholders, It will come as no surprise to you that 2009 was a challenging year for businesses around the world. Xerox was no exception. As the recession took its toll, customers pulled back from making new investments in technology, used their current technology less and sought to reduce spending wherever they could. As a consequence, total revenue for the year was $15.2 billion, down 14 percent from the previous year. To help offset this recessionary impact on revenue, we focused intently on reducing costs and generating cash – taking tough actions to weather the storm while prioritizing investments to accelerate growth. Letter to Shareholders Our operational improvements, along with our substantial recurring revenue stream, enabled the following results: • Net income of $485 million • Operating cash flow of $2.2 billion • Closed the year with $3.8 billion in cash1 • Gross margin of 39.7 percent • Debt reduction of $1.1 billion2 • Earnings per share of 55 cents; adjusted earnings per share of 60 cents3 – better than the expectations we set in the first quarter of 2009.
Considering the challenges in the marketplace, we’re especially pleased with the progress we made in delivering on our priorities of cash generation and cost and expense management. This is thanks to the determination of Xerox people who always stand and deliver. Investing in Our Future As proud as we are of our results in the depths of a global recession, we know that we must grow revenue to build even more value for our company and for you. That’s why we remain sharply focused on strengthening our leadership in document management, as well as significantly scaling and growing our services business. Among our many assets, we are known for and continue to invest in three indisputable strengths: our brand, global presence and renowned innovation. By leveraging these three pillars, we’re expanding into more markets and creating more valuebased offerings for our clients through technology and services. Last year, we brought to market 34 new products, increasing what is already the industry’s broadest portfolio of technology that serves businesses small to large. For example, our clients in the graphic arts marketplace – many of whom print for a living – are always seeking faster, more productive technology so they can better serve their customers. In 2009, we announced the Xerox® iGen4® 220 Perfecting Press. It’s a digital color press that can print 220 impressions per minute and up to seven million impressions per month – reliable technology that works hard so our customers can profit. Of course, Xerox’s brand and technology remain prominent in workplaces of any size. It’s been 50 years since we first launched the Xerox® 914, the world’s first plain-paper copier and an invention that dramatically changed the way information is shared. Fast forward to today and our customers still depend on Xerox for document technology that does more for less. The Xerox® ColorQube™ does just that. Launched in May last year, the ColorQube is a game changer in our industry. It cuts the cost of color pages by up to 62 percent compared to traditional color lasers – making it virtually the same as black-and-white for several applications – and it prints, scans, faxes and copies without compromising print quality. It’s also a good example of our focus on helping customers with their sustainability initiatives. Compared to traditional laser printers, ColorQube creates 90 percent less waste from supplies, cuts down on storage space, uses less energy, produces fewer greenhouse gases and meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rigorous new ENERGY STAR® requirements. As critical as our technology is, so too is our distribution. Xerox boasts the broadest and deepest global sales network in our industry, including direct sales, agents and concessionaires, value-added resellers and teleWeb sales. During 2009, we continued to expand our reach. Most notable was the acquisition of ComDoc, Inc., one of the larger independent dealers in the U.S. Our operations in the United Kingdom also formed a strategic partnership with the Danwood Group. With 34 sales offices, Danwood is the largest independent supplier of printing solutions in Europe and gives us access to more customers in both the corporate and public sector. You can expect more world-class technology and innovation from Xerox – this year and every year. In 2009, we received 706 U.S. patents – that’s a 16 percent increase from 2008 and places Xerox among the world’s top 25 corporate patent recipients. Add in the 425 U.S. patents received by Fuji Xerox and our total swells to 1,131, putting Xerox in the No. 12 spot worldwide.
We point this out because it’s critical to our future. We innovate today so that we can help our customers tomorrow. It’s at the very core of what Xerox does, why we have sustained our leadership in innovation for six decades and why we have been able to widen the gap against our competitors in recent years. Traditionally, innovation in our business applies to our hardware and software technology. But it also helps differentiate our service offerings and is especially relevant as we exploit the huge market opportunities in business process and IT outsourcing. Scaling in Services Many of our clients are increasingly seeking service providers that offer a full range of solutions – from the management of their print services to the management of work processes in their back and front offices. Large enterprises also demand global capabilities and global account management. And, our customers are demanding more value from their technology. They want their hardware investments married with software, and they want total packages that solve a problem, cut their costs, simplify the way they get work done – or a combination of all three. We understand these marketplace dynamics very well. Instead of watching them play out in front of us, we knew the better approach was to become a bigger, broader player in the game. The reason is clear: in a mature hardware technology market, the larger growth opportunity is in services. “Services” is a broadly defined word. As we look at it in our document management business, services comprise both the technical support of our equipment and, as important, the software and outsourcing that relate to workflow in a business. For example: Through our enterprise print services, we help customers save up to 30 percent on their document costs by managing all the devices in their workplaces – regardless of manufacturer – and by handling the supplies, maintenance and support that go along with them. (It’s important to note that we continue to be positioned by Gartner, Inc. in the Leaders Quadrant in the “Magic Quadrant for Managed Print Services Worldwide” – meaningful industry recognition that reflects our strong leadership in this growing business.) So, in scaling our services business, we started with following the document, where we have knowledge and expertise that no one else can match. That focus led us quite naturally to business process outsourcing (BPO). Most business processes are driven by documents, which gives us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves from competitors – most of whom are IT providers. 
That’s a big deal for us. Think about it. BPO is all about taking time-consuming operations and either automating them and/or finding more productive ways to do them manually. Healthcare is a good example. If you’ve been to a doctor or hospital recently, you know that the industry is still paperdependent. In many cases, BPO providers are working behind the scenes keeping the paper flowing and getting it where it needs to be – producing hard copies, converting paper to digital, distributing forms, processing payments and so on. The same is true in many other facets of our daily lives – mortgage applications, credit card processing, benefits forms, insurance claims, and on and on. We know how to apply document software, such as advancements in redaction and categorization, to make these processes more efficient and effective. That’s why BPO became the logical and natural next step for Xerox. With a BPO business, we extend our global participation in vertical markets – like healthcare, transportation and financial services. And, we participate in a more diversified and fastergrowing market that holds up well in any economy. Nowhere was this strategy more visible than in our acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services (ACS). Completed in February of 2010, Xerox’s acquisition of ACS significantly strengthens our financial position and enables us to take a quantum leap forward in expanding our already growing services business. It puts an emphatic exclamation point on our drive to transform our company. Growth is certainly at the center of this transformation. While perhaps not a familiar name in the marketplace, ACS touches millions of lives everyday. Consider this: ACS, which is now a Xerox company: • Provides services to more than 1,700 federal, state, county and local governments, making ACS the largest provider of managed services to government entities in the United States. • Processes about $3 billion in electronic toll collections every year. • Handles more than 1.5 million phone calls daily in 150 customer care centers. • Manages more than 12.5 million student loans worth $170 billion. • Provides HR services for more than 4.4 million employees and retirees annually. 
Strategically and financially, extending our global brand into business process outsourcing is all about growth acceleration and value creation – more value for our customers through a broader set of technology and services offerings, and more sustainable value for our shareholders by strengthening our financial profile. In fact, the benefits to our business are immediate, including: • Giving us scale and leadership in business process outsourcing, a market that is growing at a rate of 5 percent per year. • Increasing our already strong free cash flow4 , which is expected to exceed $2 billion per year or more than 8 percent of annual revenue. • Strengthening our annuity-based business model. Through multi-year service contracts for BPO and document management, Xerox’s recurring revenue will represent 80 percent of total revenue. • Enhancing our profitable revenue growth. Through cost and revenue synergies, we expect to increase our operating margin by 1 percent per year through 2012, which will expand earnings by 15 to 20 percent. The acquisition would not have been possible without the approval of Xerox shareholders who voted overwhelmingly for it. In fact, more than 96 percent of the votes cast gave us the green light. We can’t tell you how gratifying that is and we are committed to giving you a good return on this investment. Xerox People: Our Greatest Asset We are feeling good about where we are and where we’re heading. Much of our optimism comes from the investments we have made, but much of it comes also from the caliber and commitment of Xerox people. We both spend a lot of time with Xerox customers. Wherever we go around the world, our customers sing the praises of Xerox people. They are our competitive advantage. Last year, our people received more than 350 awards. They were won by Xerox people in every corner of the globe and they were given for our innovation, technology, products and services; for our leadership in diversity, sustainability, corporate responsibility and community involvement; for being well-managed, using Lean Six Sigma exceptionally well, exhibiting a strong sense of values and ethics and being a good place to work. One award was especially gratifying. J.D. Power and Associates recognized Xerox for providing “an outstanding customer service experience.” This is the fourth consecutive year that Xerox people have been awarded this coveted distinction. Awards like these confirm what we already know – that we are privileged to lead a wonderful group of people. It’s a responsibility we take quite seriously. And, it’s one of the key reasons we so carefully planned the transition of one Chief Executive Officer to another that took place on July 1, 2009. The transition was smooth and natural as we knew it would be – another sign of the values and culture of this special company. Despite the recession and its impact on our revenue, we exceeded our financial expectations in most respects last year and generated $2.2 billion in operating cash. We brought a new array of technology to market. We increased our distribution to bring the Xerox brand to more businesses of any size in more places around the world. We announced the ACS acquisition, significantly expanding our portfolio of services. And, we had a seamless transfer of leadership at the helm.
Ready for Real Business As we look at the dynamics of the markets we serve and understand deeply the challenges our customers face, the value proposition that Xerox offers becomes clearer every day. We know that the one thing that is predictable about business is that it is fundamentally unpredictable. Successful businesses navigate through this unpredictability by making sure the technology, software and business processes that form the backbone of their organizations are operating as effectively and efficiently as possible. No one understands this better than Xerox. We have the technology and services to take on all our clients’ essential business processes, giving them the freedom to focus on what matters most: their real business. It’s a powerful statement and one that defines and differentiates our new company. Xerox is now a $22 billion firm that is the world’s leading global enterprise for business process and document management. With our strong leadership in document technology, services and BPO, we are a major player in a $500 billion market – that’s four times the size of the market we traditionally have been a part of – and it’s a market that is growing by more than 5 percent per year. Through our strong will to win, we are aggressively pursuing more than our fair share of this sizable growth opportunity.
We know we speak for all Xerox people, now 130,000 strong, when we say that we are ready for real business – for growing our business and for creating value for our customers and our shareholders. We take those obligations very seriously. In a world of uncertainty, you can count on at least one thing – we will do everything in our power to give you a good return on your investment. That’s a promise

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2010,"Dear Fellow Shareholders: I am pleased to report that 2010 was a year of both steady progress and historic transformation for Xerox. Our results speak to the strength of our business model, the expanding value we bring to our customers, our growing distribution capability and the determination of our people to do what it takes to give you a good return on the trust you place in us. Here is a summary of how we performed in 2010: • We delivered adjusted earnings per share of 94 cents1 for the year – well ahead of our expectations as we entered 2010. • Total revenue was $21.6 billion – up 3 percent1 on a pro-forma basis. • We generated a very substantial $2.7 billion in cash from operations. • From the time we acquired Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) in February, we reduced debt by $1.9 billion. • Our operating margin for the year was 9.6 percent1 – an improvement of one percentage point1 over the previous year on a pro-forma basis. These are the basic facts, but they don’t begin to tell the whole story. When the history of Xerox for this decade is written, I have no doubt that 2010 will be viewed as a pivotal time. Many businesses talk about transformation. We’re actually doing it. Through last year’s acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services, our significant expansion into services and our expanding distribution capacity, Xerox is now the world’s leading enterprise for business process and document management. The New Xerox Most of you know us best for our world leadership in document technology and services – printers, multifunction devices, copiers, production publishing systems, managed print services, and related software and solutions. We’re proud of that heritage and we continue to build on it today. And now we are also a leader in business process and IT outsourcing. We offer our customers a wide variety of global services that may surprise you – from claims reimbursement and electronic toll transactions to the management of HR benefits and customer care centers. Think of the modern-day enterprise as a multi-story office building with IT occupying one floor, customer care on another, HR on top of that and then finance and accounting on another. You might just find the new Xerox on any one or all of these floors using our expertise in business process and IT outsourcing to work behind the scenes to make it all operate more efficiently and more effectively. And if you think of a vertical column running the height of the building, that would be our document management capability, supporting every facet of the enterprise. Many of these functions and operations require expertise most companies don’t have and time most companies don’t want to invest. It’s not their real business. By outsourcing it to Xerox, our clients have more freedom to focus on what counts: their core business, their real business. And we do it in such a way that our customers save money and improve productivity by taking advantage of the scale, speed and simplification that comes from our advantaged technology and expertise in managing basic and complex business functions. As a result, Xerox is now in places you may not expect to see us and still in places that are a natural fit with our technology – all indicative of our transforming business and our exciting future. Here are a few examples of what I mean: • 3 Italia, the Italian global media company, turned to Xerox to provide superior customer care services for nine million customers. 3 Italia joins a long list of customers who use our services in industries ranging from high-tech to aviation. With more than 34,000 customer care agents in 142 customer care centers around the world, we handle more than one million customer transactions every day – and we do it in 20 different languages.
The State of Wisconsin signed an eight-year, $30 million contract to have Xerox continue handling the State’s childsupport payment processing operations – including processing and disbursing payments, performing bank reconciliation and managing a customer service call center. All 50 states have contracts with us for a variety of business processing and other services that include child support, food stamps, Medicaid, disability, health and welfare. • Fiat Group signed a five-year contract for Xerox to manage its print infrastructure company-wide. Expected results include a 30 percent reduction in print-related cost and a 50 percent reduction in energy use. Fiat joins other Xerox customers for managed print services like the Dow Chemical Company, Ingersoll Rand and hundreds more. • Transit riders in Denver will notice a faster, more efficient and greener experience as the City implements an advanced fare collection system managed by Xerox. As part of a four-year, $15 million contract, public transportation users will receive smart cards, load them with a pre-paid amount and simply wave the smart card in front of a scanner to gain access to the transit system. We do this and similar applications – like E-ZPass™ – for scores of municipalities. • More than 20,000 Procter & Gamble employees will soon be able to print e-mails, presentations and other business documents directly from their smart phones. It’s all part of a much broader Enterprise Print Services strategy managed by Xerox for P&G around the world. It’s credited with driving cost down and productivity up while helping the company meet its aggressive sustainability goals. • Aspen Marketing, the largest privately held marketing services company in the United States, uses our digital technology – including Xerox iGen4® presses, DocuTech® Highlight Color Systems, Xerox FreeFlow® Web Services and XMPie® PersonalEffect Cross-Media solution – to help auto dealerships increase floor traffic and grow revenue from maintenance services. They’re promoting client loyalty through personalized direct-marketing materials such as postcards, letters and invitations. • The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, the industry-leading lawn and garden care company, turned to Xerox for help on upgrading its IT infrastructure across Europe. The 10-country overhaul was accomplished in four months while reducing costs, improving performance and embedding better innovation. • To maximize ROI on its 401(k) plan, a global defense and technology giant asked Xerox to design and implement a communication campaign to educate employees about the importance of saving for retirement. The results: increased employee participation rates, increased contribution rates and improved asset allocation. • And, of course, we’re using ACS ourselves to run some of our own back-office operations such as HR benefits processing and accounts payable. Multiply those examples by thousands more and you begin to see the scope and scale of our company – and the extraordinary opportunities for growth. Growth Opportunities With the building of our services business alongside our technology business, the size of the market we address has grown exponentially. Our traditional technology-driven market is valued at about $130 billion and is relatively flat. But we now participate in two additional markets: • Business Process Outsourcing, which is currently valued at over $150 billion and is growing at over 5 percent per year. • Information Technology Outsourcing, which is currently valued at $250 billion a year and is growing at over 3 percent per year. In total, that’s a more than $500 billion market – more than three times our traditional opportunity. We’re attacking it aggressively on four fronts. First, we’re accelerating the transition to color. Until recently, the barrier to “color everywhere” has been cost. That barrier was broken first in the home with the advent of affordable color ink-jet printers. Now we’re breaking the cost barrier in office and production environments with our advantaged solid ink technology. For some applications, a color page is already priced the same as a black-andwhite one. We have our eyes wide open to the trends in the marketplace around a declining use of paper for transactional black-and-white documents. A good example is all those bill statements that used to be mailed hardcopy every month and are now distributed by e-mail. If you looked around most offices these days, you’d be convinced that paper is never really going away. That may be true, but the way we use paper is changing and our dependency on it is declining. The higher-value print communications are those produced in color – photo books, marketing collaterals, direct mailers and packaging. And those printed in color with messages customized for the individual cut through clutter in ways that no electronic communication ever can. That’s why our investments in printing are focused entirely on breaking the cost barriers in color and advancing digital technology for the creation of real-time, relevant, personalized communications. 
To that end, here’s another unexpected place you’ll find Xerox today: Mediaware Digital is a leading provider of digitally printed packaging. It depends on Xerox’s Automated Packaging Solution to produce the packaging for Microsoft’s Windows 7. It’s a good example of how our printing business has expanded way beyond putting marks on a sheet of paper – and why our technology is needed and remains relevant well into the future. Second, we’re expanding our distribution. We already have the industry’s broadest distribution to large enterprises and we continue to increase our distribution capacity to small and mid-size businesses. We understand that in today’s world people buy and engage in a variety of ways. We’ve moved aggressively in recent years to both strengthen the distribution channels we have and acquire the new channels we need. One great move by Xerox was the acquisition of Global Imaging Systems a few years ago. The GIS network of 29 core companies gave us an additional 1,400 feet on the street. We’ve since expanded our distribution even more with acquisitions in key U.S. markets and in the Netherlands. You can expect to see us do more of the same – growing our network of channels so more people are on more streets selling more Xerox technology and services. Third, we’re extending our lead in document outsourcing. We’re the acknowledged leader and intend to keep it that way. Our value proposition is simple: we can do your document management more efficiently and at less cost than you can do it yourself. In today’s world, that’s a powerful statement. And it removes one more distraction from our clients’ desire to focus on their core business. Although it may seem counter-intuitive coming from Xerox, we almost always help our customers print less, thereby saving them money and helping them minimize their impact on the environment. One example: At Procter & Gamble, we consolidated all the devices it used for printing, copying, scanning and faxing into a more manageable and cost-efficient network of multifunction systems. The managed print services we provide to P&G has enabled it to print eight million fewer pages and reduce print-related energy by 30 percent. Fourth, we’re expanding our business process and IT outsourcing businesses globally. Our acquisition of ACS was largely based on our confidence in the significant services growth opportunity. Over 90 percent of the ACS business is currently in the United States. Our global strength and brand awareness give ACS the capability and permission to expand into markets around the world – often growing our business with existing Xerox clients. Our innovation in areas like advanced imaging and data analysis gives us an advantage in how we serve our clients – more ways of automating typically manual processes and more ways to simplify often complex document and data-intensive transactions, like claims reimbursement and invoice processing. Our expertise in creating cloud-based platforms for these services and our extensive experience in labor management for delivering quality support become key differentiators for Xerox and position us incredibly well for long-term growth.
One very positive sign: last year, we developed a services pipeline of more than $5 billion in business that neither Xerox nor ACS could have signed without the value the other brought to the table. So we do not want for opportunity. I have great confidence in our value proposition and in the technology and talent we have to deliver it. And that’s a very good place to be. Renowned Innovation This company was built on innovation, which remains central to our strategy today. If you could look under the hood of our R&D labs around the world, you would probably be surprised at what you would find. You would see work that is stretching the boundaries of what is possible in digital printing of course, but you would also find in at least equal measure work on intuitive data analysis and a variety of green technologies to make business processes more sustainable. In other words, you would see innovation that reflects the new Xerox. One measure of how well we are doing is the number of patents our innovators are awarded. Last year, that number was 1,031 – up 46 percent from 2009. That would rank us in the top 20 companies. Last year’s patents included innovations to improve inventory management, e-mail overload and personalized packaging. Other patents help manage documents and make sense out of large collections of information. Our Real Business: Sound Strategy and Effective Execution We now have two distinct yet synergistic business segments – technology and services. This gives us a steady mix of annuity revenue. In technology, it comes from service and supplies. In services, it comes from multi-year outsourcing contracts. Together, they account for more than 80 percent of our total revenue – a very attractive feature of our business model. By the way, annuity revenue in 2010 on a proforma basis was up 2 percent without the impact of currency1 . In technology, our annuity stream is fueled by the sales of Xerox equipment. Last year, equipment sales were up a significant 10 percent without the impact of currency1 . That growth reflected both strong demand for new products and expanded distribution coverage around the world. The combination positioned us extraordinarily well to take advantage of an improving economy and the willingness for customers to begin investing in technology. Just as our annuity revenue is fueled by equipment sales, our equipment sales are fueled by a steady stream of new products. During 2010, we launched 21 products with an emphasis on maintaining our leadership in both the production and office markets. Big contributors to equipment sales growth in 2010 were the Xerox® Color 800 and 1000 series as well as the ColorQube® family of multifunction systems, which uses our proprietary solid ink technology. Total color revenue for the year was up 8 percent without the impact of currency1 and color pages were up 9 percent – strong signs that our color strategy is on track. While our services business received a major power surge with the acquisition of ACS, this part of our business has been evolving for a very long time. By the time we acquired ACS one year ago, we already had over a $3.5 billion services business – some of it through organic growth and some of it through smaller acquisitions. The ACS deal was a logical – albeit bold – leap forward. Overnight, we became a $10 billion services business. 
Year-over-year our revenue from services was up 3 percent1 on a proforma basis and indicators for future revenues remain strong. Business signings were up about 13 percent on a trailing 12-month basis. So positive results in both technology and services, good opportunities going forward and a team that is focused on excellent execution. Delivering Shareholder Value In 2010, we grew adjusted earnings, increased revenue, improved operating margin and generated $2.7 billion in cash. We delivered on our commitments across the board. And by doing so, we created greater value for our shareholders. That was then; this is now. We enter 2011 with building momentum and heightened confidence. I don’t know that anyone has the hubris to predict with any certainty what the post-recession business climate will be like. But I do know this – businesses and governments, large and small, will continue to struggle to contain costs, operate more efficiently, grow revenue and build better client relationships. In other words, they will want to go about their real business and Xerox is ready to help them. We’re confident, but not complacent. We’re differentiated in the marketplace through our world-class innovation and renowned service. We operate in some 160 countries and that’s becoming more and more important to our larger customers who are looking for global solutions. Our world-class brand gives us a high degree of trust that helps us open doors and build relationships. We’re relevant to our customers who rely on us to make them better. Our business model has been tested under the most trying conditions the past few years and proven to be both resilient and flexible. We are focused on the basics – containing cost, generating cash, growing revenue and providing you with good returns. Our 2011 priorities and plans keep us on track to grow revenue, generate significant cash and expand earnings. We won’t compromise our leadership position or give an inch in document technology. By continuing to expand distribution, we’ll increase install activity and equipment sales – with an emphasis on driving color pages that help boost our annuity stream. We’ll continue to grow our services business by leveraging our brand, global scale, innovation and delivery platforms to win multimilliondollar deals in business process, IT and document outsourcing. We’ll remain diligent on cost and expense management, capturing key cost synergies from the ACS acquisition and driving efficiencies and productivity across the enterprise. We’ll continue to focus on generating free cash flow1 – about $2 billion of it – all the while reducing debt, delivering dividends, closing on “tuck-in” acquisitions and allotting a significant portion of available cash to repurchasing stock. We are now 136,000 people strong doing business in 160 countries and all with an overreaching mission of delivering value to our customers and our shareholders. I’m confident we have the right strategy, a sound business model, the competitive strength, a seasoned leadership team, talented people, and the discipline and focus to put it all together for you in 2011. This is our real business, and we’re ready.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2011,"The one thing that’s predictable about business is that it’s fundamentally unpredictable. It’s constantly changing – by chance and by design. And, macro forces bring new challenges every day. This was certainly the case in 2011 – a pivotal year of transformation for our business, and a year when – all said and done – Xerox people delivered solid financial results, made measured progress, and continued to build our company into the world’s leading enterprise for business process and document management. Here is a brief summary of how we performed: • We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.081 – up 15 percent1 over the previous year. • Total revenue for the full year was $22.6 billion – up two percent pro-forma.1 • We generated $2 billion in cash from operations. • Adjusted net income of $1.6 billion1 was up 21 percent.1 • We resumed our share repurchase program in 2011 and made a sizable investment in it, as well as paying $265 million in dividends – tangible signs of our commitment to return value to our shareholders. Delivering on Commitments Throughout the year, our business faced challenges stemming from global economic uncertainty as well as the impact on our supply chain from the earthquake in Japan. Despite these pressures, I’m pleased with our 2011 results, but far from satisfied. I’m impatient by nature and, therefore, very focused on speeding up our progress. As a company, we’re doing this through the following strategies. While the statements themselves seem relatively simple, the complexity is in the detail, and our priorities are clearly centered on the implementation. First: Accelerating our services business. We set out to grow services faster by diversifying our offerings and expanding globally. More of our total revenue now comes from services than technology. In 2011, revenue from services grew six percent pro-forma1 . And, through expanded sales activities, we won a considerable amount of new business – increasing our new business signings by 14 percent.
Second: Maintaining our leadership in document technology. We not only continue to hold our number-one equipment revenue market share position, but we also grew share in 2011. We did this by offering a more extensive and affordable portfolio of color products and by expanding our distribution to serve more small and midsize businesses around the world. Third: Managing our business with a disciplined focus on operational excellence. This gives us the financial flexibility to help offset certain pressures on the business – whether it’s economic uncertainty or necessary investments that drive growth. Either way – and despite challenges thrown our way – our focus is on delivering strong bottom-line results. We’re justifiably proud that we do this very well. Fourth: The bottom line for Xerox shareholders – expanding earnings and returning value to all of you. By executing well on the first three priorities, we delivered on the fourth. Full-year 2011 adjusted earnings per share grew 15 percent1 . We generated $2 billion in operating cash flow and repurchased a significant number of Xerox shares during the year. 
So, good results. And, they’re evidence of a company that is financially sound, delivering consistent double-digit earnings growth and applying operational excellence to navigate that unpredictability most companies face. But, as I mentioned previously, I’m not satisfied – and I won’t be until we grow revenue faster. In 2011, revenue was hampered by macro conditions. But, we didn’t let the headwinds that pressured our top-line performance disrupt our ability to deliver strong bottom-line results. That said, ratcheting revenue is a necessity for the sustainable strength of our business. I have great confidence in our growth potential, and, I can assure you, the Xerox team is taking a targeted approach to capture the rich opportunity in front of us. 
Transformation of Xerox Changes are taking place in our heartland industry of document technology. We won’t see a paperless office anytime soon, but we are seeing less reliance on paper in our daily lives, both at work and at home. One example I often use, because everybody gets it, is bank statements, credit card bills and things of that sort. Most of you likely now receive your bill statements online instead of paper statements in the mail. And you’re probably paying for those bills online too. Somewhere in that transactional process, Xerox is very likely behind the scenes making it happen. That’s because we didn’t resist what’s been taking place in our industry and we didn’t stick our heads in the sand to avoid seeing the changes. We have had our eyes wide open, embraced the changes and in many cases led them. In fact, we started to transform our company more than a decade ago. Once synonymous with copying and then printing, some of you might recall we began referring to ourselves as The Document Company – a signal that we had expertise in paper and digital documents and a sweet spot in helping customers navigate seamlessly between both worlds. We started to make niche acquisitions that enabled us to handle digital discovery for lawyers, electronic mortgage applications for banks and others. The more we did, the more our customers wanted. That’s a great place to be – a window of opportunity that doesn’t come often. As you know, we leapt at the opportunity. Two years ago, we acquired Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), a major player in the business process and IT outsourcing market. Overnight, our $3.5 billion services business became a $10 billion business. And, through our growth in this area, revenue from services now represents the largest portion of our business. As I like to point out: lots of companies talk about transformation; we’re doing it. Since acquiring ACS, I’ve done a lot of reflecting on how it has changed our company. Two paradoxical thoughts keep coming back to me. One is that the more things change, the more they stay the same. From our earliest days, our purpose was never about making copies. It was about making it easier for people to share information. Chester Carlson, the inventor of xerography, said as much when he described his goal as “making office work a little simpler, a little less tedious and a little more productive.” Making things simpler has always been in our DNA. When you walk up to a Xerox device, then as now, you select your features, push a button and a lot of very complex technology takes over – technology the customer doesn’t care too much about or need to know about. By the way, much the same is true of the ACS tradition – a company that was built over time on the premise that being exceptionally good at back-office work gave its clients one less thing to worry about.
As Xerox and ACS became one, I believe our founders would be pleased that, at the core, our purpose has not shifted far from our legacies – doing things behind the curtain to simplify the ways work gets done. That’s what I mean when I say that the more things change, the more they stay the same in some fundamental ways. Relevant Value Proposition The other thought I keep coming back to is how relevant the new Xerox has become. With our value proposition as the world’s leading enterprise for business process and document management, we free companies to be the best at what they do. When I meet with my peers in business and governments around the world, a handful of concerns keep repeating themselves. First, everything about their operations is in a state of flux. Change, even chaos, is the norm. Back-office operations are seen as necessary, but not a core competency. Enterprises know they are essential, but don’t want to expend energy and resources on them that can be better used elsewhere. That’s why more and more organizations – business and government, big and small – are turning to partners who know how to run big, complex business processes flawlessly and efficiently. “I think you would be amazed at both the breadth and depth of the business processes we design and operate – customer call centers, accounts payable and receivable, HR benefits programs, IT infrastructure and networks, health information exchanges, ‘red-light cameras’ for traffic violations and so much more.” “KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and other airlines asked us to convert their paper tickets to an electronic format, streamlining the process and delivering a 75 percent reduction in turnaround time.” In other words, they want business partners like Xerox. We have the deep knowledge, the innovative approach and the operational excellence that drive down cost and take the worry off the shoulders of our customers. I think you would be amazed at both the breadth and depth of the business processes we design and operate – customer call centers, accounts payable and receivable, HR benefits programs, IT infrastructure and networks, health information exchanges, ‘red-light cameras’ for traffic violations and so much more. We’re the company you encounter every day and never see. For example, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and other airlines asked us to convert their paper tickets to an electronic format, streamlining the process and delivering a 75 percent reduction in turnaround time.
A second concern that customers keep bringing up is one everyone can relate to – information overload. We all deal with mountains of information. Some of it’s on paper, some is digital and it’s all coming at us at dizzying speed and greater volume than ever. Clients can’t be bothered with thinking about the problem, let alone addressing it. They want partners who can speed up and simplify access to information and data and make it all affordable. In other words, they want partners like Xerox. We have unmatched capabilities, expertise, technology and services to manage the flow of information and bridge the divide between paper and digital – simply and affordably. In most cases, we even save customers money, make their lives simpler and make the earth greener. For example, at Medco, we’re developing and managing a multichannel platform that lets Medco’s 65 million members personalize how they receive information from the company – via hard-copy statements, secure website, email, text messages or a combination of all these channels. A related issue is the difficulty clients have in finding and using data. As one of my friends is fond of saying: “I save everything and can find nothing.” She voices a common issue. Information is everywhere – on paper, online, in photos, on servers, on the desktop, in file drawers, in smartphones and now in the cloud. There are all sorts of issues that come with the volume of information – privacy, access, retrieval and storage, to name a few. The customers I meet know they have both a problem and a lost opportunity. Whoever said information is power had it right. Customers yearn for partners who can take those streams of data and mountains of information and harness them to create value. Customers want someone to make sure they’re making the right investments to help them find what they want when they want. They want to turn information from a liability into an asset. In other words, they want partners like Xerox. We are expert at protecting client privacy, mining data for competitive advantage and improved customer service, and getting just the right piece of information or insight to just the right person just when they need it. In the world of information, we’re the “just-in-time” people. 
For example, we’re using data from traffic and parking patterns to help the City of Los Angeles turn parking into a smart, analyticsbased business. Electronic street signs and smartphone apps direct drivers to available spaces in real time. Fees for parking vary by demand as a way of directing more people to mass transit during peak rush hours. It’s a smart way to use information that results in a simpler way for people to get around. And, it’s Xerox innovation – much of which was developed at our research centers in France and Palo Alto – at its very best. And the last question that is on the minds of business leaders – but, interestingly is never directly asked – is this: “Is this a company I want to do business with?” There are a lot of important questions behind that basic one. Customers want to know you’ll be fair and honest, that you’re reliable and won’t let them down, that you’ll continue to innovate and bring them best practices, that the values of the company speak to things that are important to them. In other words, they want partners like Xerox. Customers have choices on who gets their business. Trusting some of your most critical operational processes to a business partner is a high-stakes game. We’re staffing call centers on behalf of our customers. Paying bills and transacting payments on their behalf. Managing IT infrastructures on their behalf. Creating sophisticated electronic medical records on their behalf. Processing insurance claims on their behalf. Creating and distributing client communication on their behalf. Considering these responsibilities, I’m proud to look our customers in the eye and tell them that we’re as close to a “sure bet” as they will ever find. And if there is a problem, we will work with them for as long as it takes to make it right. There are a lot of proof points that we’re the company that a customer wants: • Our brand is known and respected around the world. Its multibillion-dollar value is the sum total of millions upon millions of decisions made, actions taken and values lived by our people for several decades. • We operate our business through a value system that was espoused by our founders over 60 years ago. These values include a deep commitment to corporate citizenship that is a point of pride for our business and for our people. And it’s rewarding to be recognized for our actions: last year the Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Xerox a leader in environmental stewardship and social responsibility.
• Innovation is in our DNA. By applying the breakthroughs that emerge from our five global research labs into our products and services, we continue to differentiate ourselves with clients and competitors. The Xerox group, which includes our partnership with Fuji Xerox, garnered 1,618 U.S. patents last year, placing us eighth on the IFI patent intelligence list worldwide – and assuring our customers that we will continue to bring them a steady stream of innovation and value. Enabling Customers to Be Their Best No, we don’t make the sexiest new product on the market or run a hospital that saves lives or get you to work safely and on time or manufacture the most luxurious and safest aircraft on the planet or design a spacecraft that will explore the stars. But we do something every bit as important. We’re behind the scenes, managing the “must-do work” that enables every one of those things to happen. It’s a noble mission. To take some very complex business processes and make them simple for those who need them. We’ve become a critical enabler for business and government. When you speak with leaders in the public and private sector, they don’t tell you that they pay their Medicare clients in a cost-effective way or that their marketing brochures are personalized and printed with the highest quality. They tell you that they provide a safety net for people who need healthcare or that they have the best smartphones in the world. We allow all these great people to do what they do really well. And, that’s a great place to be. Now I must tell you that it tries my patience. Every place I look, I see a process we should be improving. If I see an accounting operation or a document technology center or an IT hub or a call center, I want to grab someone and tell them they shouldn’t be worried about it. You should make your cars or provide a service to your clients and let us worry about this “stuff” for you.
As I hope you can tell, this work excites me. We create value on so many levels. We are just hitting our stride. And, I’m confident a world of opportunity is ours for the taking.
Opportunities Abound We operate in a $600 billion market. We have a sound strategy to aggressively pursue growth. We have an enviable value proposition that helps our clients improve their business results. We have a business model that is proven, flexible and robust. And we have a unique blend of innovative technology, operational excellence and a remarkable reservoir of expertise that resides in the minds of our people. Our priorities remain the same in 2012. They’re straightforward and align with every business decision we make: • Accelerate growth in our services business. • Maintain our leadership in technology. • Continue our focus on operational excellence. • Expand earnings and give you a good return on your investment. To that end, in 2012 we expect to continue increasing earnings per share. We’ll grow revenue and generate strong cash flow. By doing so, we’ll provide further value to you through dividends and share repurchase. We are keenly aware that the world’s economies are still in recovery. We are humbled by the strength of our competitors. And we know that as good as we are today, we must be even better tomorrow. That challenge galvanizes us. We wouldn’t have it any other way. We’re excited about the extraordinary opportunity that stretches out before us. Xerox people – now 140,000 strong – are ready to pursue it aggressively on your behalf. We don’t take the trust you place in us for granted. We’re ready for real business.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2012,"Dear Fellow Shareholders, This report is filled with numbers. In our big data world, numbers speak volumes about results. They influence your investment decisions and they influence the way we run our business. I’m an engineer by training and lead with a strong passion for our brand and an obsession with the numbers that indicate our progress. We’re a company going through considerable change at a time when economies are uncertain, the markets we serve are shifting and our “always on” connected world requires a faster pace and a more competitive edge to win. Numbers keep me grounded. They provide clarity of where we’ve been and where we’re headed. Here’s a glimpse of what I mean… 52 percent of our revenue now comes from Services. While our brand is still associated with our heritage in copying and printing, today more than half of our business is linked to a diverse portfolio of outsourcing services, including customer care (likely even for the company who makes your smartphone), healthcare claims reimbursement (likely for your private insurance company) and automated tolling and parking transactions (think EZ Pass and then think how long commutes would be without it). 84 percent of Xerox’s revenue is annuity based. That’s $18.9 billion in revenue. A stable, less volatile base. $2.6 billion in operating cash flow, which reflects the cash-generating strength of this annuity-based business model. #1 worldwide revenue market share leadership for our Document Technology. This speaks to the continued power of the Xerox brand in a market that we created and continue to benefit from through healthy margins and established relationships in 160 countries. 1,900. That’s the total number of patents garnered by Xerox along with our colleagues at the Palo Alto Research Center and at Fuji Xerox last year alone, bringing to more than 11,500 the number of active Letter to Shareholders U.S. patents in our portfolio. This year, October 22 to be exact, marks the 75th anniversary of when Chester Carlson made the first xerographic image in his lab in New York City. His humble ways of applying innovation to more easily share information continue to be a source of inspiration for our research community. And, remarkably 75 years later, our innovation focus remains very true to Chester’s – finding smarter ways to strip away complexity and simplify how work gets done. These numbers are a big part of today’s Xerox. We’re evolving every day from the well-established copier company to the world’s leading enterprise for business process and document management. Our transformation comes with its share of challenges. In 2012, we continued to face them head on – prioritizing where we needed to make improvement and executing with precision to deliver. We made progress. In some areas, the progress isn’t fast enough for me. For example, as we ramp up growth in our Services business, we must also improve our Services operating margin. That means being more disciplined in how we execute large contracts, so we’re applying innovation and identifying efficient ways to serve our clients better. We increased margins in the fourth quarter of 2012 – and I expect that the benefits of our operational focus in this area will deliver continued improvement going forward. Despite the economic headwinds we faced last year, I believe we can improve revenue trends in our Document Technology business. We understand the market dynamics, know the pressure points and can identify where weakness is due to economy and where weakness is due to secular concerns. We are also clear eyed on areas of greatest growth potential – like in color printing and reaching more small and mid-size businesses around the world. Last year, we were conservative in the way we managed our Document Technology business. Due to the economic uncertainty across most regions, we put our focus on reducing the cost base while expanding distribution through indirect channels. This year, we’re ramping up marketing investments and introducing new offerings while broadening our channel partnerships – positioning us better to pursue profitable opportunities. So, although 2012 presented our business with some obstacles, we moved forward in refining our business model, improving operational efficiency and growing our Services business – all while delivering value to you. Here’s a summary of how we performed: • Net income of $1.2 billion; adjusted net income of $1.4 billion.1 • GAAP earnings per share of 88 cents; adjusted earnings per share of $1.03.1 • Total revenue of $22.4 billion, down 1 percent or flat in constant currency1 from 2011. -Total Services revenue of $11.5 billion, up 6 percent or up 7 percent in constant currency.1 -Total Document Technology revenue of $9.5 billion, down 8 percent or down 6 percent in constant currency.1 • Operating margin of 9.3 percent.1 • Operating cash flow of $2.6 billion. • Share repurchase of $1.05 billion and $255 million in dividends. Priorities Drive Performance We participate in a $600 billion market. And we continue to tackle it aggressively on four fronts. First: Managing our Services business for growth. I mentioned earlier that revenue from our Services business is now more than half of our total revenue and is growing at a steady pace. We expect it will grow to two-thirds of our revenue by 2017. My confidence in the longterm success of our Services business stems from the diversity of our offerings and the deep expertise we’ve established to work closely with clients on their important business processes: • When a major automobile company selected Xerox to handle their employee benefits program, we were able to build, manage and support their open enrollment process in a matter of months. • Just as a telecommunications company decided to start selling their new product in Brazil, they tapped us to open, staff and lead their in-country customer care service. • As soon as the Affordable Care Act in the United States became more of a certainty for state governments, several of our government clients looked to us for help establishing Health Insurance Exchanges and strengthening the administrative backbone of their Medicaid and other health and welfare programs. I could go on but the bottom line is that our Services business will continue to grow because of the breadth and depth of our offerings and, more important, because of our respected experience, innovation and expertise that wins us trust from our clients. That trust helped us sign new contracts during 2012 worth more than $2 billion in annual revenue and to win 85 percent of the contracts that were up for renewal during the year. It’s trust we never take for granted. 
Second: Maintaining our leadership in Document Technology. Print is changing, but it is far from dead. Where transactional black-and-white documents are in decline, color printing in offices and graphic communications settings is growing – and, not surprising, is an area of strength for our business. We offer the industry’s broadest range of color printing technology to serve small offices all the way up to large production houses. You may no longer use inkjet printers in your home. (That’s OK with me; it’s not the business we’re in.) But, in offices and print shops, our color technology is in demand and has resulted in pages on color devices growing 9 percent in 2012. Through an expanded network of channel partners, we’re now able to bring the Xerox brand to more establishments around the globe. Third: Managing our business with a focus on operational excellence. This is something we’re very proficient at today and it’s an area where we never rest. It gives us the financial flexibility to help offset certain pressures on the business – whether it’s economic uncertainty or necessary investments that drive growth. We continue to invest in what matters to our customers, including high-value scalable products and unrivalled service and delivery that earn customer loyalty. Fourth: Delivering strong cash flow and returning value to you. By executing with precision and excellence on the first three priorities, we delivered on the fourth. We generated $2.6 billion in operating cash flow in 2012 and allocated $1.05 billion of that cash to buy back a significant number of Xerox shares during the year. In addition, we paid out $255 million in dividends during the year. You expect and deserve a strong return on your investment in Xerox and we owe you nothing less. So, that’s our story. Solid results in a challenging environment – a robust strategy for an expanding market opportunity – and a clear set of priorities aimed at creating value for all of our constituents. But that’s only part of the story… here’s the rest. Creating Customer Value I spend a lot of my time meeting with customers, learning about their business problems and trying to explain to them that we can help. Just a few years ago, that was a tough sell. The Xerox brand is powerful, but for many it stood for superior document technology. Period. Talking to our customers about our Services offerings was often met with “Is that what Xerox does?” That has changed – partly because of our marketing efforts and partly because of the pervasiveness of our footprint. Today I can tell customers that we handle $421 billion in accounts payables annually… answer 1.6 million customer interactions daily… manage benefits for more than 11 million employees… process 900 million insurance claims every year… collect 37 billion transit fares annually… reduce document-related costs for enterprises large and small by up to 30 percent… and a whole lot more. Sustainable Strategy I was speaking with students recently at NYU Polytechnic, my undergraduate alma mater, when a student asked me what Xerox might look like five years from now. The world is changing at such a dramatic pace that I imagine a lot of CEOs might have a difficult time answering 
that question. Frankly, I didn’t. That’s because our strategy is built to evolve. We continue to invest heavily in innovation and to work with our customers to understand their changing needs. Although I can’t tell you how we will be solving their business process problems five years out, I can tell you that we will continue to simplify the way their back-office work gets done while boosting productivity and reducing costs. We’ve been at this for a very long time – ever since Chester Carlson set out to make office work a little easier. It’s a journey toward a neverending goal of making things simpler for our customers so they can focus on what matters most. That’s what we’ll be doing five years from now and likely 50 years from now as well. To that end, the team at Xerox and I are bullish about the future. We know there’ll be hurdles to overcome, we know where we can improve, but we also know we’ll stay focused, impatient with the status quo and hungry for greater success. So this is a good time to keep your eye on Xerox. Here’s why: • Services-led growth; • profitable leadership from Document Technology; • cash-generating annuity-based business model; • consistent earnings expansion; and • financial strength to invest in building value for Xerox… and building value for you. And, of course, we’ll be doing all this with a passion for helping our customers succeed… a thirst for innovation… a respect for our people
and our commitment to help them grow… a deep desire to make our communities and our planet always better than they are… and a responsibility to create value for all our stakeholders. You can count on us to make it happen. Thank you for your trust in Xerox. We work hard every day to earn it and to keep it. It’s that simple.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2013,"At Xerox, we’re here to help our customers be more successful by harnessing the potential of services and technologies for the promise of a better world. That’s a grand statement. Let me explain. We take very complex business processes and challenges, create solutions and make them appear simple to the people who need them. We use innovation smartly and strategically to help the world tackle some daunting and complex tasks. It’s a noble mission and part of the Xerox heritage. It may surprise you to know that the man who invented xerography 75 years ago had the same objective. In 1938, a patent attorney named Chester Carlson created an easier way to duplicate information on paper. After spending countless hours in the New York Public Library hand-writing copies of materials he needed, he was determined to find a way “to make office work a little more productive and a little less tedious.” His invention, later named xerography, gave birth to Xerox and revolutionized how information is shared, ultimately simplifying how office work gets done. Seventy-five years later, Chester’s vision lives on in every aspect of today’s Xerox and has led us on a journey to innovate ways to simplify complex and tedious work. To that end, today’s Xerox provides not only the world-class document technology you would expect, but also a deep and broad array of business process, document and information technology outsourcing services you might not expect. As we expand further into business services, chances are very good that Xerox is touching your life every day. If you drive toll roads or park in municipal parking, we probably handle the transaction. If you apply for a mortgage or call for help with your mobile device or file a medical claim or pay bills, we probably handle those transactions, too. That’s because we work behind the scenes – in both the public and private sector – to make sure things work smoothly in hundreds of different ways. And, as remarkable as our evolution has been, there is so much more that we will do in the future for our customers, shareholders, employees and communities around the world. At Xerox, there’s inspiration and innovation around every corner, and we’re on a mission to move it forward another 75 years. 
Results in 2013 For Xerox, 2013 was another year of steady progress – a year in which we continued to evolve our business model, improve operational efficiency, invest in growth and win in the global marketplace. All while delivering value to you. Here’s a summary of how we performed: • Net income of $1.2 billion; adjusted net income of $1.4 billion._ • GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of 93 cents. • Adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, which compares to $1.02_ in 2012. • Total revenue of $21.4 billion, down 1 percent or 2 percent in constant currency_ from 2012. – Total Services revenue of $11.9 billion, up 3 percent. – Total Document Technology revenue of $8.9 billion, down 6 percent. • Operating margin of 8.9 percent._ • Operating cash flow of $2.4 billion. At the same time, we continued to take steps to build shareholder value. In 2013, we returned nearly $1 billion to you through $700 million of share repurchases and almost $300 million in dividends. Last year we increased our common stock dividend by 35 percent and just recently announced another 9 percent increase starting in April 2014. Nonetheless, our results were impacted by the effect of lower revenues and operating margins stemming from challenges in several of our businesses and a sluggish world economy. We are tackling these obstacles head on and we are confident our profit improvement plans will position us for long-term growth. Differentiating and delivering The numbers don’t tell the entire story. In 2013, we took aggressive action to boost future profitability and we made some critical strategic bets that are differentiating Xerox in the marketplace and increasing the value we bring to our customers. Here’s a snapshot of the progress we made: New clients, new markets. Xerox is known for world-class innovation and service. Our investments in innovation have generated new services and products and have led us to engage with new clients and new markets around the globe. We have invested in those businesses that are aligned with our core strengths and market opportunities like transportation, healthcare, education, graphic communications and customer care. In doing so, we successfully supported the launch of new health insurance exchanges in a half dozen states, helping them comply with the U.S. Affordable Care Act. We simplified services in government healthcare with Enterprise, our next generation Medicaid Management Information System, which helps states manage their Medicaid programs and prevent fraud and abuse. And, we rolled out smart parking solutions in Malaysia and Texas, as well as our real-time analytics-based technology – Merge® – that addresses parking challenges in car-centric cities like Los Angeles.
We launched our next generation managed print services, paving the way for future growth with new workflow and digital automation for today’s connected world. Our managed print services have been awarded highest honors for global market leadership by industry analyst firms, a distinction that validates the strength of our document outsourcing business. And, we saw investments in Europe begin to yield benefits with growth in our European Services business. We will keep up the pace in Europe and build on investments we have made in Asia to grow our Services business there. In addition, key metrics are trending well: in Services, total contract signings were up 21 percent for the full year; new business signings were up 5 percent; the contract renewal rate in our business process and IT outsourcing businesses was 92 percent; and in Document Technology, we had good product install growth in key segments and retained our leadership in worldwide market share. Our shift to a Services-led company is ongoing and requires us to constantly enhance our offerings and deliver unique solutions to our customers. In 2014, we will continue to invest in growing vertical markets and in expanding internationally so that we can extend our reach to more customers around the world. Targeted acquisitions, strategic partnerships. During 2013, we added to our capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships, something we’ll continue to expand in 2014. In Services, we made our portfolio stronger by adding service offerings in areas that complement our strengths, such as e-learning solutions for pharmacists, cloudbased finance and accounting services, and software that simplifies pension administration. In our Document Technology business we acquired Impika to advance our presence in the high-growth production inkjet segment and added distribution capacity in the U.S. And we’re off to a fast start in 2014 with the acquisition of the European customer care services company, Invoco, and a healthy pipeline of other potential deals. We also partnered with technology companies like HCL and Cognizant to deliver best-in-class expertise in engineering and software development. World-class products, revolutionary innovation. To further support the customer experience, we continued to develop and deploy relevant products in 2013, like our multifunction printers enabled with ConnectKey® technology, which have seen sales of more than 200,000 units so far. We also had our best year ever for sales of our iGen® family of production color printers – including a mega-win with one of the world leaders in personalized photo products and services. We are benefiting from innovation as we have shifted our investments to reflect today’s Xerox. We are stretching the boundaries of what is possible in digital printing of course, but we’re also creating agile business processes, transforming data into decisions, making personalization pervasive and enabling the sustainable and mobile enterprise. We have hundreds of scientists, engineers and researchers around the world, not only making our current offerings better, but also working closely with clients to identify problems and find simple ways to solve them. 
As a proof point, last year, Xerox was awarded 1,168 U.S. patents. We hold about 12,100 active U.S. patents and, together with our research partner Fuji Xerox, we continue to invest over $1 billion a year in research and development. Big data, powerful analytics. As the amount and types of data continue to grow exponentially, so too does the potential to revolutionize the decision-making process. We are using the power of analytics to extract value from proprietary data and transfer that value to clients. In doing so, we are delivering real answers to today’s pressing issues. In 2013, we made significant strides in enhancing our use of data and analytics for customer care and education. For example, we are providing our customer care agents with innovative call center technology to give them easier access to information to address customer needs more efficiently. And, with our Ignite™ software, which electronically grades exams and produces analytic feedback to improve learning, we are allowing teachers to customize education based on a student’s progress. Good business, good citizenship. More than ever, our story involves the commitment to innovate for a better world. We are focused on creating services and technologies that reduce the impact on the environment and showcase sustainable innovation. We are committed to helping improve working conditions across the industry’s supply chain. And we continue to invest in our communities through initiatives like our Community Involvement Program and the Xerox Foundation. In 2013, we were named one of the world’s most ethical companies by Ethisphere Magazine; one of the best technology stocks by CRN.com; No. 3 in FORTUNE magazine’s most admired companies in the computer industry; one of the top IT innovators by InformationWeek 500; and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and others recognized Xerox for our work on climate change. I’m grateful that we are being noticed for our contributions, but our work in corporate responsibility and global citizenship is never-ending. There is always more to do. Higher value, solid returns. We implemented a number of cost management and productivity improvement initiatives across the business in 2013. The good news is they enabled us to hold our expenses down while we made additional investments to better serve our customers, increase our competitiveness and put us on solid footing as we enter 2014. In Services, we are well under way in implementing a fiveplank strategy that includes not only cost initiatives but also active portfolio management to drive growth and direct investments toward our higher-margin, more differentiated offerings. We expect successful implementation of our fiveplank strategy will result in higher revenue growth, margin expansion and a healthy cash flow driven by our recurring revenue business model and increased competitiveness. Our Document Technology business is performing well with stabilized revenue declines, a strong market position and good profitability and cash flow. We will continue to nurture this resilient business in ways that maintain market leadership while boosting our bottom line. 
Building on 75 years of innovation As I think about what’s ahead, I’m incredibly optimistic about what Xerox will deliver. Consider this: when xerography was invented, little did we know that the underlying reason for that very first image would drive 75 years of innovation, business process simplification and sustained success for our company. The core of our story is based on the premise that we live in an age when technology is producing transformative change, enabling businesses big and small to accomplish more than could have been dreamed possible decades ago. At Xerox, we are in a strong position to capitalize on market opportunities and deliver on our commitment to create value for all our stakeholders. Here’s why: • Our Services business serves as a beacon for our path forward; • our Document Technology business is the fuel that allows growth; • our culture of innovation permits us to think big; • we are committed to delivering earnings expansion; and • we are managing our cash in a way that’s building value for you for years to come. Chester Carlson was on to something 75 years ago. And, today at Xerox, we continue to believe our purpose is to simplify how work gets done. When we do just that in smart, innovative ways, we’ll help the world work a little better… for the next 75 years. This is a journey we’re committed to. Thank you for your continued support.

Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2014,"In my letters to you over the last several years, I have updated you on the steps we have taken to position Xerox for the future. Since the acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services five years ago, we have taken Xerox from a company focused primarily on document and information management to one that supports critical business processes for enterprises of all sizes, including over 90 percent of the Fortune 100. While the composition of our portfolio has changed significantly, our core mission has not. Xerox has always been focused on helping companies and governments innovate and engineer the way they work for greater productivity, efficiency, work capacity and personalization.

Rethinking the Way Work is Done
“Invented just over 75 years ago, xerography dramatically scaled the way organizations could communicate.”
Xerox is best known for the innovation we brought to the sharing of information. Invented just over 75 years ago, xerography dramatically scaled the way organizations could communicate. It solved a major barrier to the way organizations shared information, yielding a range of operational benefits. It remains a core communication technology in every business, government office and educational institution today. Since then, Xerox innovation has been at the core of today’s digital world – from the invention of some of the earliest personal computers to being instrumental in 3-D print-head technology.

And today, that same mission to apply technology and innovation to improve business process and workflow is relevant to a range of functional domains across almost every industry. Consider the following:

Xerox is the claim process provider for the top 20 U.S. health insurance providers, including all 12 Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, touching 2 out of every 3 insured lives.
Xerox is a market leader in the U.S. for transportation-related services including automated tolling and parking.
Xerox is the processor for hundreds of billions of dollars in accounts payables and receivables for blue-chip clients, automating their order-to-cash life cycle.
Xerox is the leading quality and care performance analytics software provider to more than 1,900 hospitals.
Xerox is the administrator for global HR teams running industry-leading health, welfare and defined benefits plans for over 14 million employees and retirees.
Xerox is the teacher’s aide supporting learning on-the-go so that educators and students can print and share from mobile devices.
In each of these examples, we are working side-by-side with our clients to innovate and engineer business processes that are automated, agile and lean.

“As I look at today’s business environment, it is clear that the world is rich with opportunity for Xerox to help organizations rethink the way they are operating.”
As I look at today’s business environment, it is clear that the world is rich with opportunity for Xerox to help organizations rethink the way they are operating. Organizations of all sizes, all around the world, are faced with the challenge of doing more things while simultaneously satisfying a growing list of more vocal stakeholders. For example, businesses aspire to operate at a greater scale, but they also need to provide increasingly personal experiences. Their available information and data are expanding, and yet there is a need for more powerful and actionable insights. Their markets are demanding more transparency and openness, and yet information and processes must be more secure than ever.

These pressures create operational tension that requires organizations to continually transform the way they perform work. At Xerox, we are applying our expertise in business process, imaging, user-experience and analytics to help clients become more productive, efficient, secure and precise across a wide range of domains and industries.

Here are some examples that put this into perspective:

Managing communicable diseases requires the highest levels of coordination across multiple players to ensure prevention, protection and recovery for those at risk. Our Maven® Disease Surveillance and Outbreak Management Software helps to manage this complex coordination for health professionals through an offering from one of our recent acquisitions, Consilience Software. Maven streamlines the many steps required to identify, monitor, possibly quarantine and treat those infected (or possibly infected). A shared platform coordinates activities among government health agencies, medical providers and people at risk. During 2014, Maven played a key role in managing Ebola cases and contacts in the U.S.
The U.S. trucking industry must contend with a range of safety, weight and credential requirements – all of which vary state by state. HELP, Inc., a non-profit, public-private partnership dedicated to motor-carrier safety, turned to Xerox to support PrePass. PrePass saves the trucking industry time, fuel and money by enabling qualified motor carriers to electronically comply with state requirements – eliminating the need to stop at weigh stations. HELP and Xerox also offer electronic prepayment of truck tolls on 78 roads, turnpikes, tunnels and bridges in 15 states.
The management of information and documents has never been so important as it is in today’s “always-on” workplace. Grohe, a global supplier of luxury bathroom fixtures based in Germany, selected Xerox to manage the way it prints, shares and processes documents. With our market-leading managed print services, Grohe strengthened document security and reduced print costs by 25 percent while decreasing printing devices from 500 to 280. Throughout Grohe’s locations in North America, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Switzerland, Xerox delivers customized document production, IT infrastructure planning and implementation, device maintenance and supplies replacement.
Many cities are burdened with antiquated, coin-operated parking systems that frustrate drivers and can impede business in urban areas. The City of Indianapolis selected ParkIndy, a public-private partnership between the city and Xerox, to modernize its old coin-operated parking meters to help make parking stress free, improve traffic and increase business for local merchants. As one of the first U.S. cities where all meter payments can be made by credit card or phone, Indianapolis has seen substantial growth in the number of motorists choosing ParkIndy’s convenient payment methods. The new system requires less maintenance, is solar powered and reduces emissions as a result of improved traffic flow. In addition, Xerox uses analytics to improve compliance and provide policy recommendations to the city. Xerox has successfully implemented and operated intelligent parking systems for more than 25 cities in the U.S.
“We are helping the world work better in today’s highly connected, agile economy.”
Buck Consultants at Xerox launched SavIncent™, a new financial wellness program that improves employees’ financial health and retirement readiness. SavIncent is a unique program that links financial education and activities to a company’s retirement savings plan. Employees who complete various elements of the program are rewarded with employer contributions to their savings plan, thus motivating them to improve their financial health.
Xerox worked with the South Carolina Department of Social Services to improve the delivery of government assistance to nearly half a million South Carolinians. Benefit recipients access benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) with convenient electronic benefits transfer cards. We are also delivering a Web-based data warehouse to aid the state’s fraud unit in detecting suspicious behavior. Xerox is a leader in government card services with programs that make it easier for nearly 25 million people in 29 states to get cost-effective and convenient access to their benefits.
Multiply those examples by hundreds more and you begin to see how we are helping the world work better in today’s highly connected, agile economy – and the extraordinary opportunities for growth.

Performance in 2014
We delivered a solid financial performance in 2014. Here are some highlights:

Net income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion.
Operating cash flow of $2.06 billion.
Operating margin of 9.61 percent, up 0.6 points year-over-year.
Revenue of $19.5 billion.
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of 90 cents.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.071, up 3 cents year-over-year.
Returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, a 40 percent increase from 2013.
As proud as we are of our results, we know that even stronger results are required to build more value for our company and for you. That is why we continue to lead an aggressive agenda to better strengthen our offering portfolio, improve productivity and target segments where we are best positioned to compete and differentiate. Here are some examples illustrating the steps we are taking along those lines:

We announced the pending divestiture of our Information Technology Outsourcing business to Atos, an international leader in digital services. This will allow us to focus our Services business squarely on business process outsourcing and document outsourcing, and provide additional capacity to invest further in these businesses.
Our Canadian operations closed its largest ever, multimillion-dollar managed print services deal with the government of Canada.
We added new talent and fresh perspectives to our leadership team through internal promotions and external hires.
We launched a new structural and go-to-market model for our Services business and aligned our delivery resources along functional capabilities such as customer care, human resources, consulting and analytics, and transaction processing, essentially reorienting our entire Services organization – 100,000 people around the globe – while continuing to run and drive operational improvements across the business.
We brought to market over 40 new products and workflow solutions that increase productivity, mobility, security and sustainability – and remind the market of our innovation power. Our continued focus on Document Technology gave us the proud distinction of being the equipment share leader for the fifth consecutive year.
We invested nearly $350 million in acquisitions and strategic partnerships in attractive markets like business process and software platforms and services to maximize our strengths and expand our global reach. For example, through our acquisition of ISG Holdings, Inc., we established a leadership position in the workers’ compensation claims processing market. We also invested in HealthSpot and will be their exclusive business process outsourcing provider as they endeavor to offer groundbreaking telehealth to patients at convenient neighborhood locations.
“We continue to lead an aggressive agenda to better strengthen our offering portfolio, improve productivity and target segments where we are best positioned to compete and differentiate.”
We continued to build our innovation ecosystem and were awarded 1,114 U.S. patents in 2014. Close to half of our patent filings were in services software and included innovations to improve automation of labor intensive work, analytics to extract actionable insights from data, and personalization to increase relevance of products and services like customized packaging and 3-D printing. We even introduced an intelligent virtual customer care agent that can diagnose and resolve customer inquiries in the same way – if not better – than a human agent would.
As a result of this kind of work, we are on track to drive greater growth and margin in our Services business, while simultaneously strengthening our leadership in Document Technology. I have great confidence in our future potential, and I can assure you that all of us at Xerox are taking a targeted approach to capture the rich opportunity in front of us.

Ready for the Future
In closing, we enter 2015 with a sense of momentum and heightened confidence. We clearly see that tomorrow’s enterprise will be nothing like today’s. And, while it is difficult to predict with certainty what the future business climate will be like, I do know that businesses and governments, large and small, will continue to face a growing list of challenges they will need to conquer. And, people will continue to need better transportation, healthcare, education, mobility and customer service.

Xerox is here to help. As I mentioned earlier, helping organizations rethink the way they work has been a core mission since our founding. We will always be known as the company that helped change the way the world shares information. But over time, our goal is to be recognized as the company that is helping to change the way the world parks... shops... learns... publishes... gets benefits... receives medical care... I could go on and on. We not only perform this work on a massive scale – and benefit our clients in the process – but we also touch billions of people by improving key moments in their lives every day.

I know I speak for the Xerox team – 140,000-plus strong – when I say that today’s business challenges are made for our unique combination of capabilities. We are playing to our strengths and ushering in a period of growth for our business and for creating more value for our clients, our people and you."
Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2015,"Fellow Shareholders:
2015 was a year of transition for Xerox. Our financial results were mixed in an increasingly challenging market environment, but we remained committed to delivering value through our focus on targeted growth segments, our solid financial position and team of great people. The many important decisions we made reflect the way we keep our key stakeholders, especially our shareholders, at the center of everything we do.

One of the most pivotal decisions we made, in early 2016, one that we believe will deliver the highest value-creating opportunity for shareholders, was our move to separate Xerox into two independent companies. This decision followed a comprehensive review of our structural options and provides us with increased strategic focus, financial flexibility and agility. We have created a new path forward.

Before I share more about our future, I’ll review our 2015 results.

Year in Review
In 2015, we delivered strong capital returns despite pressures stemming from global economic uncertainty, weakened currencies, and the effect of lower revenues and operating margins from challenges in several of our businesses. Here’s a summary of how we performed:

We delivered adjusted1 earnings per share of $0.98; GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.49.
Total revenue for 2015 was $18 billion, down 8 percent or 4 percent in constant currency from 2014.
We generated solid operating cash flow of $1.6 billion.
Operating margin1 for the year was 8.4 percent, down 1.2 points over the previous year.
We continued to deliver value to our shareholders. We returned $1.6 billion to you through $1.3 billion of share repurchases and over $300 million in dividends. As of January 2016, we increased our annual dividend by 11 percent to $0.31 per share, the highest level since 2000.
Differentiating and Delivering in Targeted Markets
We operate in an environment defined by rapidly shifting trends both in the broader economy and in the industry sectors we serve. Within this context, a core element of our strategy has been to identify growth markets where we can differentiate or disrupt through our innovation and expertise in improving the flow of work. In those spaces, we not only address critical client needs, we also support business processes that touch the lives of millions of people: drivers, patients, shoppers, employees and benefit recipients, just to name a few. Below are some examples of what I mean:

The State of Florida selected Xerox to implement a state-of-the-art customer service system for processing toll transactions. Building on our existing relationship with the state, we will process more than a billion toll transactions and manage over five million individual accounts annually. The new service system will consolidate Florida’s multiple tollway operations into a single back-office system that will reduce costs, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the driver and customer experience.
We remain the innovation leader in managed print services, a category that we pioneered almost two decades ago. In 2015, we introduced new tools that further automate business processes, boost employee productivity, and drive security, mobility and sustainability. In 2015, Xerox received leadership awards from Quocirca, IDC and Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for managed print and content services.
We are partnering with the State of New York to update its Medicaid claims processing system to our next-generation technology solution, Health Enterprise. Our flexible Medicaid Management Information System helps New York and other states manage all aspects of today’s Medicaid programs, including managed care and other areas that are needed to comply with the U.S. Affordable Care Act, as well as prevent fraud and abuse.
We are redefining the future of print technology through innovations like printed electronic labeling that improves product security and enables data collection throughout the supply chain. We are seeing high interest in this technology from segments such as pharmaceuticals where product authenticity is a growing problem.
Optimizing Our Portfolio
2015 also was a year that was distinguished by a number of key actions we took to optimize and position our portfolio for the future. These decisions were made to create more focus in markets where Xerox can differentiate its offerings and exceed client expectations, all in service of improving operating performance and increasing shareholder value. Here are some examples:

We sold our Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) business to Atos, an international leader in IT services. The transaction resulted in a greater focus on our Business Process Outsourcing and Document Outsourcing businesses. It also enabled us to partner with Atos on developing solutions for our customers that leverage Atos’ world-class ITO capabilities.
We restructured our government healthcare business to increase our focus on higher margin, growing segments like medical and pharmacy benefits management, and fraud and abuse detection. We also reduced our participation in certain Medicaid platform implementations that were presenting unattractive levels of risk and exposure.
Our Document Technology business successfully refreshed its product portfolio by introducing nine new products. Notable among them was the Xerox Rialto® 900 Inkjet production color press. It sets a new standard in production volume and efficiency while offering the smallest footprint of any inkjet press on the market.
Selective acquisitions remained a key lever for short- and long-term growth. An example is our acquisition of Healthy Communities Institute that strengthened our leadership in healthcare analytics. Its leading cloud platform puts socioeconomic and community health information at the fingertips of hospitals, public health agencies and community coalitions.
A New Path Forward
On January 29, 2016, we announced our plans to separate into two independent companies: one comprising our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses, and the other our Business Process Outsourcing business. Both will be significant Fortune 500-scale companies and leaders in their markets:

The Document Technology company will continue to be the global leader in a $90 billion market with a presence in approximately 180 countries. It will include our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses. Together, they generated $11 billion in revenue in 2015. This business is the equipment share leader, and its managed print services offerings are widely recognized as best-of-breed by industry analysts.
The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company will continue to be a leading enterprise for the next generation of BPO. In 2015, this business generated $7 billion in revenue. It has the second-largest market share in an industry that is rapidly expanding, with notable growth opportunities in healthcare, transportation, the public sector and a range of other industries.
We are confident this is the best way forward for our shareholders, clients and employees. With increased strategic focus and financial flexibility, we can capitalize on the unique strengths of our Document Technology and BPO businesses and capture the value-creation opportunities that we see in each of them.

For customers and partners, each company will maintain its leading service delivery and innovation excellence. But we will be able to more quickly respond to market forces and client needs through simplification, greater focus and agility. Our employees will benefit from working for industry leaders with leaner structures, faster decision making and improved growth opportunities. Investors will benefit from two distinct investment opportunities, each with an enhanced focus on long-term growth and profitability.

We expect the separation to be completed by the end of 2016.

Strategic Transformation Program
In conjunction with the separation announcement, we also launched a strategic transformation program targeting incremental savings of $600 million over three years. This brings our total cumulative savings target to $2.4 billion during this period, which includes our ongoing productivity initiatives.

This plan is company-wide and will include a thorough review of how we work and how we operate. Bottom line, we’re not only optimizing our portfolio and capital structure, we also are driving a strategic transformation. This will competitively position both companies and set them up for success during the separation process and beyond.

The Year Ahead
2016 will be a defining year for Xerox.

We are dedicated to delivering on our commitments to our shareholders, clients and employees while successfully executing the separation and implementing the first phase of our three-year strategic transformation program.

On behalf of the Xerox Board of Directors, I am confident that the plan to separate into two strong, independent companies is the right path forward to improve the value we deliver to customers and partners, increase returns for shareholders, and become the employer of choice in the document technology and BPO industries.

I hope you share our excitement about our company’s new path forward. Our efforts to transform Xerox are under way, and we appreciate your continued support during this journey."

Fellow Shareholders:
As I write my first shareholder letter as the CEO of Xerox, I am humbled by the opportunity of leading this storied company, aware of both the promising prospects and the challenges ahead, but, most of all, I am excited about what the future has in store for us.

Last year was an extraordinary and pivotal year for our company. On December 31, 2016, we completed the separation of Xerox and Conduent. We are now a new Xerox with a clearly defined mission: to innovate the way the world communicates, connects and works. It’s a mission, which, at its core, is about helping businesses and governments alike improve productivity, maximize profitability and increase customer satisfaction. From the introduction of the first automatic copier in 1959, to the advances we’re making today in printed electronics, personalization and workflow automation, we embody collaboration and communication. As the new Xerox, we are refocused on leading the industry with market-making and disruptive solutions that redefine “print” and change the way information is used and shared.

Our Results
We remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns. You should expect nothing less. In this report, we share 2016 financial results that represent Xerox – without Conduent – to establish a baseline you can measure us against moving forward. Here is a summary of how we performed:

Adjusted earnings per share(1) of $0.88; GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.58.
Revenue of $10.8 billion, down 6 percent or 4 percent on a constant currency basis(1) from 2015.
Adjusted operating margin(1) of 12.5 percent, at the top of the range we expected.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1,018 million.
Year-end cash balance of $2.2 billion, which includes $1.0 billion of cash used for debt repayment in first quarter 2017.
Announced plans to pay an annual dividend of 25 cents per share.
In 2016, we delivered strong margins and a healthy cash flow in the midst of preparing for and completing the separation. We also launched a three-year Strategic Transformation program with a goal of delivering at least $1.5 billion of cost and productivity savings from 2016 to 2018. In the first year, we delivered $550 million in gross savings – exceeding our goal – and we are on pace to meet our target for 2017 of $600 million. But it is not just about the numbers. This program is improving our operational excellence and competitiveness, allowing us to both reinvest in the business and deliver attractive returns to shareholders. It is also helping us mitigate the impact of declining revenue, which we are aggressively addressing through our strategy.

As part of the program, we made numerous operational changes. We delayered the organization to streamline decision making and create an environment that enables a quicker go-to-market path. We advanced the use of automation in service delivery by leveraging automated supplies replenishment and remote solve to resolve break/fix issues on our products without dispatching technicians. Within our supply chain, we removed regional and functional barriers to move toward a truly global organization and made progress consolidating our total warehousing footprint.

Delivering More Value for Our Customers
I am always encouraged and re-energized by conversations I have with our customers. Serving our customers well – and helping them solve the challenges they face in their businesses – is at the heart of everything we do.

Our customers turn to our products and solutions to work more efficiently and bridge the gap between analog and digital processes. Here are a few examples of our efforts in 2016:

We brought 35 workflow automation solutions to market as part of our managed document solutions. These new offerings address specific customer needs, acting as a bridge between our products and the important business and process workflows of our customers.
We launched the ConnectKey®-enabled i-Series multifunction printers for the office. This line of multifunction printers promotes work collaboration by coming equipped with ready-to-use apps to speed up paper-dependent business processes. We also unveiled the Xerox App Gallery, an online portal where our customers can select and download multifunction printer-resident apps to add functionality and make our products work better for them.
We continued to build out our high-end inkjet printing portfolio, adding two new inkjet presses – the cut-sheet Xerox Brenva® HD Production Inkjet Press and the continuous feed Xerox Trivor® 2400 Inkjet Press. Both will allow us to better meet our customers’ needs in the growing inkjet market.
Pursuing Growth Opportunities
We’re a $10.8 billion company in an $85 billion market, and, as I tell my team, that gives us ample opportunity to grow and expand. We hold leadership positions in key segments and serve a range of customers from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to large enterprises, governments and graphic communications providers. It’s a market we helped create and continue to lead.

Part of the work we did in 2016 was re-examining the market to evaluate how we compare with our competitors and better understand the changing needs of our customers and partners. While the overall market is declining, we identified components that are expanding at rates ranging from low single digit to double digits. Of our revenue in 2016, 38 percent came from these growing areas, and we are now implementing a plan to expand that proportion through a focus on the following strategic growth areas:

Managed document services, especially managed print services in the SMB. We plan to extend our leadership in the vital services segment.
Entry products, where pages are moving from single-function A4 sized printers to higher value A4 multifunction printers, where we are better positioned.
The production cut-sheet color and emerging production inkjet markets, an area where we are historically strong and are making investments in newer technologies.
To pursue these opportunities, we have realigned our go-to-market model and we are expanding our channels to increase our reach and strengthen our relationships with our customers. Additionally, as the new Xerox, all of our investments will once again support our print technology and document services business. Our research, development and engineering efforts continue to be well-funded at approximately $1 billion, including Fuji Xerox, and drive innovation in automation, workflow and content management, graphic communications, analytics and printing.

We’re also poised to extend our overall market leadership with the largest product launch in Xerox history in 2017. Our fleet of new multifunction devices, which serve as a workplace assistant, will help our customers transform how they work with leading security, high-performance apps, on-the-go print capabilities and cloud connectivity. They will support growth areas across all of our channels in the A4 space and strengthen our mid-range A3 multifunction printer product portfolio. These product launches, combined with our leadership and expertise in managed print services, will strengthen our value proposition for distributors and resellers, helping drive growth in SMBs.

A New Xerox
We began 2017 as a new Xerox. We laid the foundation for the future in 2016, and this year is all about execution. Our Strategic Transformation program will continue to support strong cash generation and margin expansion, as well as our ability to reinvest in the business. We’re building a strong balance sheet and we’re focused on deploying our cash flow to drive attractive shareholder returns with a commitment to return over 50 percent of our free cash flow(1) to shareholders over time. Our strategy to capture opportunities in our strategic growth areas will help us change the trajectory of our top line and, over time, outperform the market.

We have a solid business model supported by an iconic brand, a market-leading portfolio, a strong reputation for putting our customers first and the best talent in the industry. I continue to be impressed by the power of Xerox people, innovation and technology. It’s an enviable combination of strengths that makes us unique, keeps us in an industry-leading position and gets me excited about coming to work each day.

Thank you for continuing on the journey with us. I look forward to the letter I’ll write for our 2017 report, sharing our progress along with continued excitement for the future of Xerox."
Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2017,"Fellow Shareholders:
For generations, Xerox has stood for innovation, quality and an excellent customer experience. We are the company that revolutionized the office, created printing-on-demand, and repeatedly reinvented and transformed to keep pace with the demands of our customers and the market.

Today, we honor this heritage by turning investments in innovation into products and services that help our customers be more productive and profitable. With five research and development sites – including world-renowned PARC – and 2,000 scientists and engineers, we are helping define the future of work and enabling printing beyond paper with new technologies that will disrupt the market and change the way we think about workflows and information processes.

Our portfolio of ConnectKeyTM-enabled products has transformed traditional printing devices into smart and secure workplace assistants that enable workflows to be simplified and automated via standard or customized apps and integrated with market-leading office solutions. McMaster University, one of Canada’s largest and oldest institutions of higher education, will utilize the security features on its fleet of ConnectKey-enabled AltaLink® multifunction printers to protect its information. Students, faculty and administration will take advantage of apps to simplify how they work – such as the Easy Translator app that makes translations in over 40 languages instantly.

We are an industry leader in managed print services – services that help our customers save money, automate steps, boost productivity, and improve document security and environmental sustainability by gaining control of their document processes and print infrastructure. For example, Xerox will deploy our managed print services to help the U.S. Air Force focus on its missions and not worry about document management. We will provide a help desk and management of servers to deliver an efficient and comprehensive document infrastructure and effectively save the government more than 20 percent in costs by decreasing the number of devices by up to 2,000 units over the course of the following four years.

Our content management and workflow automation solutions transform manual, error-prone processes into automated and accurate approaches that take minutes instead of days. We use analytics to bring operational excellence to routine workflows, as well as industry-specific processes. In retail banking, automating the processing of loan applications – from first engagement to loan disbursement – simplifies or removes many of the manual paper handling and document processing steps. The results include reduced application processing time and error rates, increased customer satisfaction, and greater oversight and control over the process.

Commercial print, in-plant and packaging print customers rely on our graphic communications solutions to enable high-quality on-demand production of an extensive range of applications that drive growth and increase profitability. Software offerings bring automation and integration to the processing of print jobs for a touchless – and more productive – workflow. Going one step further, Vistaprint Corporate, an international provider of custom print and promotional products, uses Xerox’s XMPie® software to offer its business customers private web “storefronts” that allow employees to choose, customize and order brand collateral, marketing materials and promotional products. Vistaprint can set up a storefront for a new company in days, and its customers save time and money ordering products that represent their unique brands.

The people of Xerox help our customers communicate, connect and work better by creating great products and solutions and delivering great service. We apply our collective skills to figure out how to always be ahead of the market – identifying and addressing the evolving needs of our customers and partners.

We see opportunity as we look at our industry … from segments of the market that are growing, to the rapid developments in technology, to the continuing evolution of how work gets done. We will continue to drive change – disrupting current paradigms by developing new technologies that drive more efficient and cost-effective workflows and enable growth opportunities. Our product road maps include frequent releases of new apps, software and firmware upgrades, as well as new products to ensure we remain at the forefront of the industry. We are expanding and modernizing our software offerings – through our own development efforts, as well as partnerships – to cover the entire life cycle of documents and content. Finally, we continue to capitalize on our intellectual property by embedding it in our products and software, developing new businesses and licensing or selling patents where appropriate.

Our vision for the future requires smart investments in the business. We will continuously improve our operations while maintaining our focus on delivering superior customer service. Ultimately, our long-term success will be measured on our ability to satisfy our customers and deliver value to our shareholders.

We are proud to be part of the Xerox team and excited about the bright future ahead for this storied company."
Xerox Corporation,XRX,Info Tech,2018,"Fellow Shareholder, Since joining Xerox in May 2018, we have met with investors, customers, partners and employees to discuss reinventing Xerox and positioning the company for longterm, sustainable growth. We consistently heard from our stakeholders that the Xerox brand is synonymous with quality and reliability, but that we had work to do around leveraging our innovation and transforming our business for sustainable success. To guide our transformation, we are embracing the era of intelligent work to make a better future. We identified the following four strategic initiatives that unite our employees to a common purpose and enable you to measure our success and performance. 1. OPTIMIZE OPERATIONS In mid-2018, we established Project Own It, an enterprise-wide transformation program designed to create a simpler, more agile and effective organization, enhance our focus on our customers and partners, instill a culture of continuous improvement and improve our financial results. We identified a range of opportunities as part of Project Own It, including rationalizing our IT infrastructure, consolidating our real estate footprint, unlocking greater productivity in our supplier base and establishing more effective shared service centers. We believe Project Own It will not only make Xerox a more productive, efficient and profitable organization, it will also enable the Company to reinvest in the business to drive revenue and develop innovation. 2. DRIVE REVENUE To improve our revenue trajectory, we developed a three-year revenue roadmap that builds on our legacy of technology and services excellence and focuses on deepening the integration of our software, services and technology to provide a valueenhancing end-to-end solution for our customers. While revenue decreased in 2018, which was in line with expectations, we started to see some progress. In our Core Markets, our Workplace Solutions saw positive results from our ConnectKey® products. We maintained our No. 1 position in worldwide equipment sales revenue. Within high-end products, we brought the Iridesse™ production press to market in the first half of 2018, and its success has enabled us to retain our No. 1 market share in production color and expand our customer base, with more than 40 percent of Iridesse™ sales being new business. There is still more opportunity for us to capture market share across our core product areas. Continuing our focus on integration and security, we introduced new software to AltaLink®, our flagship A3 multifunction printer family, to allow companies to monitor critical security settings and automatically remediate unauthorized changes without having to reboot the device. We also became the only Managed Print Services provider to be pre-vetted and approved by the U.S. government’s Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). Lastly, we realigned portions of our business to support our revenue roadmap. We created a business unit to focus on driving end-to-end solutions further into our customer base. We also transitioned over 28,000 of our small and mid-sized accounts to Xerox Business Solutions (XBS)—formerly known as Global Imaging Systems—to better serve those customers at a local level and to capitalize on the successful mid-market growth model of XBS. 
3 . R E - E N E R G I Z E I N N O VAT I O N To move into adjacent and new markets that go beyond our Core Markets, we need to innovate and bring new software, services and products to market. We are taking a disciplined “startup-like” approach to ideating, developing and bringing new technologies to market with speed. 
We have designed a “Powered by Xerox®” business model and approach, where we don’t always have to build and own the end product in order to benefit commercially from it and to maximize our participation in these markets. 4. FOCUS ON CASH FLOW AND INCREASING CAPITAL RETURNS With a large portion of revenues under multi-year contractual arrangements, low annual capital expenditures and ongoing productivity initiatives, we have a business model that drives stable gross margins and operating margins as well as strong and sustainable cash flow generation. This provides us with a significant source of capital and enables us to be strategic with where and how we put our cash to work to maximize our internal rate of return, whether it is reinvestment in our business, acquisitions or share repurchases. With our transformation plan, we also have heightened our focus on cash by adding increased executive oversight and more direct accountability across the organization, and it is reflected in our results. Everything we do revolves around sustaining our strong cash generative business to deliver growing shareholder returns. M O M E N T U M G A I N E D I N 2 0 1 8 Guided by our four strategic initiatives, we started to see improvement across several key measures in 2018. We are pleased with our early progress, but we know that we have more work to do—and we need to do it with speed—to accelerate our transformation. With the foundation we established in 2018, we have everything we need to make a better future—not only for Xerox, but for the world.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2005,"We are pleased to report that net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, were $3.94 billion, an 8% increase from the prior year. Net income for the year was $240.8 million or $4.00 per share (diluted). While we recorded record income, it includes profit generated from sales of facilities. After significant share repurchases by the company during 2005, shareholders’ equity was 1.21 billion. In addition, debt declined to $643 million. The results for the year 2005 reflected acceptable, but not outstanding, performance. However, the year noted a number of positive events: continued growth in all major business areas, the profitable sale of our foreign operations, and a sizeable acquisition in the behavioral health area. However, it is important to first acknowledge that it was also a year in which our company, its patients, and its people experienced an extraordinary challenge due to the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. Responding to a Disaster As discussed later in this report, our three UHS properties in New Orleans sustained catastrophic damage due to Hurricane Katrina. And while the impact on our people and our operations was significant, this crisis showed that our organization could respond professionally under extremely adverse conditions. The whole organization gave generously to help the UHS people who were in need. As a company, our expertise and willingness to commit financial resources enabled us to launch a rapid response team to airlift critical supplies to our hospitals within hours of the onset of flooding. In addition, our network of nearby hospitals provided muchneeded shelter and a continuity of care for patients evacuated from New Orleans. These factors saved lives and boosted morale for staff members and their families during a time of crisis. At the ground level, our employees at these properties worked heroically under unimaginably difficult circumstances, rescuing patients, transporting critical supplies, and evacuating both patients and staff to other UHS facilities. Like the leaders they are, these outstanding people faced a grim situation with courage and professionalism. They overcame daunting challenges. And they got things done. The Katrina disaster also brought out the best in thousands of UHS employees around the country, who stepped forward to contribute to the UHS Foundation, which ultimately provided over $2 million in relief funds – sent directly to 1,543 UHS employees impacted by the flood. We continue to receive letters of thanks from those who were supported in their time of need. When the storm waters finally subsided, our two acute care hospitals in New Orleans were damaged possibly beyond repair, impacting our earnings for 2005 and beyond. But I am pleased to report that our River Oaks behavioral care facility was able to rebuild, recover, and reopen. Its admirable performance during the crisis is currently the subject of a University of Memphis research study, which will be made available to hospitals across the country for use in developing their own disaster plans.
A Fundamentally Strong Year While Katrina cast a shadow over the second half, much was accomplished this past year. Our Acute Care Division continued to expand, recording growth in revenues and patient volumes. Performance was especially strong in Las Vegas, where we now enjoy the leading market position. At the same time, we faced unique competitive pressures at our facilities in McAllen, Texas. But we are meeting these challenges and are confident our position will continue to improve. The past year also saw the highly profitable sale of Médi-Partenaires, our acute care hospital company in France. We also sold our acute care hospitals in Puerto Rico. The funds generated have been redeployed into new hospitals in Las Vegas and Eagle Pass, Texas, and new hospitals under development in Temecula and Palmdale, California. Our Behavioral Health Division turned in a superb performance for the year. In addition to recording strong admission rates at its existing properties, the division completed the largest acquisition in UHS history by purchasing the 46-facility KEYS Group Holdings. While the transaction was complex, through a combination of experience, resourcefulness, and hard work, our management team got things done. Strengthening Our Management Team The Company took meaningful steps to strengthen its management team. Kevin Gross was named the new head of the Acute Care Division, and Paul Yakulis became the new head of the important corporate Human Resources Department. The Design & Construction Department is now headed by Jay Hornung, who has spent five years as the department director. In addition, we made a number of senior-level promotions throughout our hospital network. Success in an Uncertain World All businesses operate in an environment of uncertainty. The past year demonstrated that uncertainty can take many forms – including natural disaster. The real lesson of 2005 is that the best strategy for an uncertain world is to have management that can act effectively, whatever the circumstance. Leaders have the experience to maintain their professional judgment during times of crisis. And they have the vision to see the solutions that lie within every crisis. I am extremely proud of the leadership that this company has demonstrated during the best and worst of times. And I thank all our shareholders for supporting our efforts, and for their confidence in our future
"
Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2006,"In a challenging health care environment Universal Health Services performed well this past year. We achieved record revenues of $4.2 billion, a 7% increase over the prior year. Our 2006 adjusted income from continuing operations (primarily adjusted for Hurricane Katrina related issues) increased to $157.5 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, representing a 9% increase over the $2.56 per diluted share earned during 2005. Our financial performance during the past year exceeded both internal and external expectations, an enviable accomplishment during a year in which most of our competitors reported disappointing results. One competitor in the proprietary industry is no longer public and another announced a major write off and recapitalization. Our behavioral health facilities, once again, performed very well during the year and continue to operate at extremely impressive occupancy and profitability levels. In an effort to satisfy the growing demand for the high quality services that we provide, we continue to add inpatient capacity at many of our existing facilities. Construction on the Hartgrove Hospital replacement facility is nearly complete and the opening is scheduled to occur during the second quarter of this year. In addition, we continue to actively explore potential acquisitions in search of high quality facilities to add to our portfolio. Our acute care facilities in Las Vegas had a solid year. We look forward to the opening of our fifth hospital in the market, Centennial Hills Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas, a 170-bed facility which is currently under construction and scheduled to open during the fourth quarter of 2007. We also have a new, 171-bed acute care facility under construction in Palmdale, California, which is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2008. In January of this year, we purchased the Texoma Healthcare System located in Denison, Texas, which includes a 234-bed acute care hospital, a 60-bed behavioral health hospital and a 21-bed rehabilitation hospital. Successful New Hospital Development Program Throughout its 28-year history the company has engineered a highly successful new hospital and replacement program. In recent years, UHS has built Spring Valley Hospital, Lakewood Ranch Medical Center, Edinburg Children’s Hospital and Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center in the acute area, and Hartgrove Hospital, Lakeside Behavioral Health System and South Texas Behavioral Health Center in the Behavioral Health Care Division, all of which are among the most successful facilities in our network. In 2002, UHS replaced the aged George Washington University Hospital with a new 371-bed state-of-the-art tertiary facility that is now one of the best equipped and most respected in the nation. We look forward to the success of the new projects now under construction and expansion which will shortly be placed in operation. Quality Quality care is basic to the mission of UHS. Our treatment philosophy is to develop an integrated team approach that standardizes care, reducing variations to improve outcomes and patient safety. Notable in this journey to excellence: We are proud that Wellington Regional Medical Center was selected as a Top 100 Hospital in the entire nation for the fourth consecutive year. And Gallup will continue to conduct surveys of our patients, physicians and employees to enable us to gauge how our services are perceived, to help enable UHS to maintain its high standard. A Strong Capital Position UHS has built and maintains a strong financial base. UHS is the only investment grade-rated publicly traded hospital company by Standard and Poor, Fitch and Moody’s, all the major rating agencies. This enables the company to easily access the public capital markets. In addition, the company is supported by a very strong bank group which includes nine of the country’s twenty largest banks as well as strong regional banking institutions. During 2006 we issued $250 million of 10-year senior notes and amended our Revolving Credit facility to increase the size from $500 to $650 million, improve pricing and extend the maturity date to June, 2011. We also redeemed our 5 percent convertible debentures due 2020. Approximately 10 percent of the debentures were redeemed at the equivalent share price of $48.50 and 90 percent of the holders exercised their option to convert their debentures into shares of our Class B common stock. During 2006 we repurchased a total of 6.5 million shares of our Class B common stock. Our solid capital position also enables UHS to provide our services to those in the community who are either indigent or cannot afford insurance coverage. We are hopeful that the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will address this problem, about which much has been written, in the very near future. A Positive Outlook We at UHS are privileged to work in an industry that involves helping people live better lives. We spend our days working in conjunction with professionals who are among the very finest in the healthcare field. Together we continue to produce superior outcomes for our patients and their families. We are excited by the new hospitals added to our network and the completion of major projects to our existing facilities. We look forward to their contribution to the company and we in turn bring our expertise and resources to new communities that are seeking advanced medical care. Of course, the greatest advantage we all have is to live in a nation that gives us the freedom to pursue our professions and our individual personal goals. We are grateful to our military for their service and sacrifice. They provide us the safety under which these pursuits are possible. At last count, 19 UHS facilities have personnel serving abroad. To show our gratitude and support, the company has a number of programs specifically directed to those who have been deployed and their families. For example, the “Hero Miles” program provides free air transportation from donated frequent flier miles. We urge you to lend your support as well. And, a sincere thank you to all who are a part of our success: our employees, physicians, nurses, vendors and shareholders.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2008,"UHS had an outstanding year in 2008. In an increasingly
difficult environment, profitability improved substantially over
2007. I firmly believe that UHS is well-prepared to weather
the current economic downturns, and that we will continue
to prosper. Why? Because from its inception nearly 30 years
ago, UHS has focused on sound decision-making, generating
sustainable growth based on prudent levels of debt.
We have evaluated and acted successfully on good
opportunities, and bought UHS stock when it was a
compelling investment. Today our seasoned management
team is better equipped to operate during an economic
downturn than most.
Acute Care, Behavioral Health divisions
moving forward
Our Acute Care Division performed well in 2008, with
new additions and expansions continuing in line with our
disciplined strategy. Selecting faster-growing communities
as our core markets has proved to be of long-term benefit
to us. Over half of UHS’ acute care facilities are located in the
most rapidly-developing areas of the country, such as the
Las Vegas area, where population increased by almost 30
percent from 2000 to 2006. In South Texas, another area
of focus for the company, population has grown about
25 percent over the same period.
Our Behavioral Health Division has been a consistent
industry leader in growth and profitability for many years.
The industry is highly fragmented and populated by
independent providers. Recognizing this profile, we have
combined growth through selective acquisition with capacity
expansion. UHS’ occupancy levels of approximately 75
percent reflect our success in building long-term community
referral relationships and physician confidence. We stand
to benefit from Congress’ adoption of mental health parity
legislation which should enhance growth opportunities
for this segment of our business.
A well-positioned company
Among publicly traded hospital operators, UHS has one
of the most diversified business mix profiles, with earnings
generated fairly evenly between its acute care and behavioral
health segments. UHS also has one of the most conservative
balance sheets in the sector, providing both financial and
operational flexibility. While most of the industry runs high
leverage ratios, UHS stands out with one of the more
favorable profiles. Debt represents only 39 percent of the
total capitalization of UHS, versus the industry average of
72 percent, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.8 times,
compared to the group at 4.6 times.
Wise decisions, successful results
Prudent decision-making is integral to the UHS strategy.
The leadership team members who understand and execute
UHS’ strategy have been with the company for decades. Our
goal is not to be the biggest provider of healthcare services,
but the best in the communities we serve. We are noted for
excellence, which most often results in consistent growth
and outstanding financial results.
The George Washington University Hospital in Washington,
D.C. is an example of good decision-making. We were chosen
to become a partner with the University in 1997 based on our
reputation. In 2002 we built a state-of-the-art replacement
facility, and today GW Hospital commands a major share of
the D.C. market and is highly regarded.
UHS has begun an initiative to lead in specialty care for
autism which is a result of the rapidly growing need for such
services. Laurel Heights Hospital in Atlanta was among the
first to provide advanced autism treatment, and now serves
the community with a wide range of care and education. The
Behavioral Health Division recently opened a second autism
treatment unit at Laurel Heights. In addition, UHS opened
Central Florida Behavioral Hospital in Orlando, with 40 beds
dedicated to autism. Autism services are expanding in a
number of our other facilities across the country.
Healthcare ... an essential industry
We are fortunate to be part of an industry that remains
essential to the U.S. economy. The older demographic in
our country is growing and along with it, the consumption
of healthcare services. In 2007 people aged 65 and older
comprised 12 percent of the total population. By 2030,
almost 20 percent of Americans – some 72 million people –
will be 65 years of age or older. People over age 85 are the
fastest-growing segment of our population. By 2030 they
will comprise 2.3 percent of our total population, up from 1.8
percent in 2007. The need for healthcare workers is growing,
too. We are not scaling back our workforce, indeed we
continue to seek highly qualified professionals in many of
our facilities.
Our goal for 2009 is to keep our most valuable resource –
our people – fully employed, and to provide superior services
to our communities. “Teamwork divides the task and
multiplies the success.” We thank our outstanding team –
employees, nurses, and physicians – and the confidence of
our shareholders for their contributions to our success. "
Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2009,"By nearly all accounts, 2009 was one of the most difficult years this nation has faced in recent memory. A deep recession and concomitant high unemployment, combined with uncertainty about healthcare reform, presented the industry with a unique set of challenges. Despite that environment, UHS had another outstanding year. The number of patients served, revenues and profitability all increased. We are very pleased that in our 30th year of operation, UHS continues to be an industry leader in terms of the quality of care the company provides and its consistent financial performance. Our performance is not something that came easily. Like others in the industry, UHS had to deal with a weak economy and high unemployment that led to greater numbers of uninsured patients, particularly in some of our largest markets. Through aggressive cost control and the leadership provided by our strong management team, we were able to mitigate the impact of the economy on our operations and record another very stellar performance in 2009. In addition to the earnings we achieved during 2009, we have continued to maintain a conservative financial posture, as evidenced by a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than 40 percent, compared to an industry average of more than 70 percent. We repurchased more than 2.6 million shares of common stock throughout the year and completed a two-forone stock split in December 2009. Key promotions were made at the corporate officer and board levels in 2009. The Board of Directors elected Marc D. Miller president of Universal Health Services. Mike Marquez was appointed president of the Acute Care Division, while Frank Lopez and Kevin DiLallo were named division vice presidents. Daniel B. Silvers joined the Board of Directors in July. Continued growth in Acute Care, Behavioral Health Both the Acute Care and Behavioral Health divisions continued to grow in 2009. The Behavioral Health Division opened Springwoods Hospital, a new 80-bed facility in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In addition, the division acquired Centennial Peaks Hospital in Louisville, Colorado, a 72-bed facility that offers psychiatric and chemical dependency programs for both adolescents and adults. The Acute Care Division opened a new replacement hospital for Texoma Medical Center and completed a new patient tower at Summerlin Hospital Medical Center. Construction proceeded smoothly on the new Palmdale Regional Medical Center, a replacement hospital for Lancaster Community Hospital that is scheduled to open in mid-2010. Prepared for healthcare reform “Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing...after they have exhausted all other possibilities.” – Winston Churchill How true … We entered 2009 expecting some type of healthcare reform to be enacted by Congress with the president’s approval. However after a year of political debate, often heated, no legislation was forthcoming. We can only hope that Winston Churchill was correct and that sometime in 2010, the federal government will do the right thing and enact reforms that strengthen our healthcare system, extending coverage and improving efficiency. During the summer of 2009, I wrote a book entitled Health Care Reform That Makes Sense. Many of the suggestions in the book — including tort reform, allowing insurance companies to sell across state lines, strengthening Health Savings Accounts (HSA) so people could directly own their policies and avoiding a public option that would ultimately lead to a government-administered single payer system – were not part of the House or Senate bills. Thankfully, recent statements from the Executive Branch and both House and Senate leadership indicate that many of the ideas put forth in my book might now be considered. We are ever hopeful that America will get reform that makes sense. No matter which reforms are enacted, it is certain that healthcare providers will continue to be under pressure to lower costs and operating expenses. UHS has built a 30-year record of achieving excellent financial performance no matter what economic conditions existed. I have every confidence that we will successfully adapt to any changes in our nation’s healthcare system. In closing, I offer my sincere thanks to all the people of UHS for their hard work and dedication that made 2009 another outstanding year for our company.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2010,"The past year was one of the most exciting in our company’s long and successful history. In November
2010, we completed the acquisition of 105 inpatient and outpatient behavioral health facilities that
had been formerly operated by Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (PSI). Our investment of more than $3 billion
was transformational for the company, as it made Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) the largest
facilities-based behavioral healthcare provider in the nation.
UHS now owns nearly 200 behavioral healthcare facilities, with annual revenue of $3.4 billion. As we
integrate our newly acquired facilities into the UHS system, we are pleased to welcome 24,000 new
employees to subsidiaries of UHS. We look forward to working with them to provide patients in every
community we serve with the high quality behavioral healthcare services that have made UHS a leader in
the industry.
While the acquisition of PSI’s behavioral health facilities will greatly enhance the company’s revenue and
profitability, our Acute Care Division, which was also quite active during 2010, will generate more than half
of our expected $7.6 billion in annual revenue.
In the closing weeks of 2009, we opened the newly constructed Texoma Medical Center in Denison, Texas
as a replacement for the hospital’s aging facility. In December 2010, we opened the new Palmdale
Regional Medical Center to replace the outdated Lancaster Community Hospital in Lancaster, California.
Both replacement hospitals will allow physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals to treat
patients in those communities with advanced medical technology in a new, modern environment.
Since our founding more than 30 years ago, UHS has pursued a strategy of making acquisitions and
pursuing growth only when it makes market sense and is reasonably priced. Because of that, UHS has not
encountered the financial problems that have affected some of its competitors, and is well positioned to
take advantage of good opportunities in the future.
Even in this challenging economic environment of high unemployment and overall slow growth, 2010
was a good year for UHS. It was a year of continued growth and improvement. The company’s strong
management team and unwavering focus on quality and efficiency allowed UHS to maintain its position as
a leader in the healthcare industry. We are pleased to report that in 2010, adjusted net income attributable
to UHS was $249.8 million, as compared to $246.2 million in 2009. Net revenues increased 7 percent to
$5.57 billion in 2010 compared to $5.20 billion in 2009.
As we look to 2011 and beyond, we are extremely enthusiastic about the future for UHS. As more people
become employed, the number of people with health insurance will increase and result in more paying
patients for the hospital industry. However, as is often the case, the future also brings with it significant
challenges. The future of healthcare reform remains unclear and its impact on healthcare providers is
uncertain. Severe budget deficits exist in many states, putting increased downward pressure on Medicaid
revenue in many of the markets in which we operate.
Controlling costs will remain a focal point for the company, as our facilities work to cope with revenue
pressure and the continuing high rate of uncompensated care. However, we are pleased with our
accomplishments thus far in meeting the challenging economic environment.
Over the past three decades, UHS has prospered and grown. Though 2010 was a difficult year for all, hard
work and dedication on the part of the people of UHS helped the company record another successful
year. I am confident we will continue that success in the coming years, and I thank all the people of our
company for their efforts."
Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2011,"“Change in the industry is inevitable. But we will continue to seek and find opportunity in change. That’s what has earned us a reputation as an innovator.”
Those words were true when I wrote them years ago and they are even more accurate today. Just as we did then, Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS) is working hard to seize every opportunity and meet all challenges so that the company continues its long record of prosperity and growth far into the future. 2011 was an important year for UHS. The company’s strong management team and its focus on quality and efficiency allowed UHS to maintain its position as an industry leader. We are pleased to report that in 2011, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $391.7 million, compared to $249.8 million in 2010. Net revenue increased 35 percent to $7.50 billion in 2011, compared to $5.57 billion in 2010. We acquired 110 facilities in the Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. acquisition and the Behavioral Health Division successfully integrated them into the company, giving us more than 200 behavioral health hospitals. As a result, our Behavioral Health Division is now the largest facilities-based behavioral healthcare organization in the country with annual revenue of $3.4 billion, accounting for 45 percent of the corporation’s annual revenue. The division added 263 beds to help meet demand. We expanded existing hospitals and constructed new facilities, including the new Cumberland Hall Hospital in Kentucky that features a separate wing to house our Patriot Support Program for active duty members of the military and veterans. 
The Acute Care Division had continued success in 2011, generating $4.1 billion in annual revenue in the face of challenging economic conditions. In the closing days of 2010, UHS opened the new Palmdale Regional Medical Center in Palmdale, California to replace the aging Lancaster Community Hospital. In 2011, we started construction of a new patient tower at Wellington Regional Medical Center in Florida, which will be completed by year’s end. We broke ground for the new 140-bed Temecula Valley Hospital in Temecula, California. We also opened building expansions at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center, in Riverside County, California. The new capacity will allow UHS to provide high quality medical care to this fast-growing market in California. We are extremely optimistic about the company’s future. In both divisions, UHS has implemented a number of programs to help enhance the quality of care we provide, and to do so efficiently. UHS retains the highest credit ratings among all its for-profit hospital competitors. Our capital structure affords us the continued flexibility to pursue our strategy of robust reinvestment in our existing hospitals and markets, along with investing in new and compelling opportunities as they arise. I am confident that we will continue to build on more than three decades of success. I am appreciative of, and thankful to the people of our company for their efforts.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2012,"Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS) recorded another successful year in 2012 despite the nation’s sluggish economy, continued high rates of unemployment and uncertainty over the direction healthcare reform would take.
By continuing its strong focus on quality care, patient satisfaction, operating efficiency and cost control, UHS enhanced its position as a premier hospital management company in the United States. Adjusted net income attributable to UHS in 2012 was $406.4 million, compared to $391.7 million in 2011. Net revenue increased 3 percent, to $6.96 billion in 2012 compared to $6.76 billion in 2011. The company stock price appreciated 24.4 percent during the year, closing 2012 at $48.35 per share. Including the $0.60 per share dividend paid in 2012, total return to shareholders was 26.0 percent. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will move forward, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the law and President Barack Obama’s re-election in November. UHS and the industry expect that the nearly 31 million uninsured Americans will get the medical insurance coverage they need. Yet to be decided is how the exchanges will be established to provide health insurance to those currently uninsured. Some states may create their own exchanges, some may join with the federal government and others may opt to leave the exchanges solely to the federal government. During the time it takes to fully address those issues, the management team at UHS will continue to prepare for each challenge, and take advantage of every opportunity so that the company will continue to operate effectively. Expansion and Quality Drive Acute Care Division The Acute Care Division of UHS initiated several new programs in 2012 so that it can best meet future challenges. Establishing a new subsidiary, called Independence Physician Management (IPM), allows UHS to better align its hospitals and physicians. The company’s clinical integration strategy is to establish physician-led chapters at every UHS acute care hospital that will identify best practices and build agreement among physicians to adopt those practices. Chapters can share best practices with other UHS hospitals through a private social media network for physicians. Process improvement programs help eliminate inefficiencies and streamline operations for maximum productivity. Supply Chain management reduces variation among the medical equipment and supplies used in UHS hospitals by identifying those that provide the best performance and value. In addition, the acute care division has taken an important step toward ensuring that medical and nursing staffs are coordinated with the goal of providing the highest quality patient care. The new Alan B. Miller Pavilion at Wellington Regional Medical Center in Wellington, Florida opened in October 2012. The three-story, 80-bed pavilion combines advanced medical technology with a number of amenities to create a comfortable environment that enhances patient care. In California, construction continued on schedule and on budget for the new Temecula Valley Hospital. The hospital is being built using unique methods that reduce construction costs and will help improve the quality of care and reduce operating expenses. When it opens in fall 2013, the new 140-bed hospital will provide needed capacity and services, such as cardiology, neurology and emergency medicine, for an underserved community in Riverside County. UHS Building Solutions, a development subsidiary, continues to use the company’s expertise to construct hospitals for other owners. Its latest hospital project, St. Vincent’s Clay County, is UHS Building Solutions’ third project for Ascension Health. Acquisition and Expansion Fuel Success for Behavioral Health The Behavioral Health Division of UHS expanded its position as the largest provider of behavioral health services in the country with its acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation, a high quality provider of behavioral health services. UHS gained nine facilities, with a total of more than 800 beds in Arizona, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington. The new Cumberland Hall Hospital building opened in Hopkinsville, Kentucky early in the year. The replacement facility features a dedicated wing to house the company’s Patriot Support Program for active duty military, veterans and their families. The company added 240 acute beds to existing facilities to meet growing demand for acute psychiatric care, and continued construction on two new facilities in Chicago, Illinois and Austin, Texas. Both facilities are scheduled to open in 2013. In addition to the Patriot Support Program, the UHS Behavioral Health Division introduced its autism spectrum disorders program at additional facilities, and continued its work with The Jason Foundation, Inc. (JFI) to help prevent teen suicide. UHS successfully partnered with JFI to pass “The Jason Flatt Act” in West Virginia, Utah, Alaska, South Carolina and Ohio. This important legislation requires educators in those states to complete two hours of youth suicide awareness and prevention training. Recognized for Quality Universal Health Services, Inc. has long held true to its mission to provide superior quality healthcare services that patients recommend to their family and friends. In September, The Joint Commission recognized 31 UHS acute care and behavioral health facilities as Top Performers on Key Quality Measures™ for 2011. This recognition for achieving excellent patient outcomes is important, as the healthcare industry will face more accountability for quality and safety in the years ahead. The management team at UHS is optimistic about the company’s future and believes that the quality, performance and efficiency initiatives that are now underway are providing a solid foundation for excellent performance in 2013, 2014 and beyond. I am confident that we will continue to build on our long history of success, and am appreciative and truly grateful to the people of our company for their efforts.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2013,"Though he said it in 1925 when speaking before the British House Of Commons, Winston Churchill could have been speaking about the U.S. healthcare industry today. For the past several years, the healthcare industry in this country has been in transformative change as healthcare reform, pressure to reduce cost, and advances in technology that require substantial investments are changing the way services are delivered. Through it all, one constant has been the way Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS) responds to the challenges and opportunities presented by change, and 2013 was no exception. Once again, the company recorded another successful year as we maintained our focus on quality care, patient satisfaction, operating efficiency and cost control. As a result, UHS continued to enhance its position as a premier hospital management company in the United States. Adjusted net income attributable to UHS in 2013 was $452.1 million, compared to $406.4 million in 2012. Net revenue increased 4.6 percent, to $7.28 billion in 2013 compared to $6.96 billion in 2012. The company’s stock price appreciated 68 percent during the year, closing 2013 at $81.26 per share. Equally important to the company’s financial performance in 2013 are the steps the management team has taken to ensure that UHS is well positioned both for 2014 and in future years. Implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has begun and though there were a number of problems with the healthcare exchange marketplaces in the initial months of operation, millions of uninsured Americans have been able to get health insurance and hopefully, that number will increase over time. Acute Care Division Focuses on Quality Our Acute Care Division performed well in 2013 as it worked to successfully meet a number of challenges as we move into a future that will see reimbursement rates increasingly tied to quality measures and patient satisfaction scores. Through process improvement programs, developing best practices and adopting new technology, we have successfully introduced a number of programs that have increased the quality of care and patient satisfaction. We completed the successful implementation of the first phase of UHS FUSION, our electronic health records initiative and are well on the way toward completing the second phase.
Independence Physician Management, a UHS subsidiary, continues to increase the number of physicians we employ and our clinical integration programs are designed to build and enhance our working relationships with physicians so that we can maintain our priority of providing effective, high quality healthcare services. In October 2013, the Acute Care Division opened Temecula Valley Hospital in Temecula, California. The new 140-bed hospital will meet the medical needs of a rapidly growing yet underserved area in Southern California. The hospital, UHS’ fourth in the region, increases the company’s presence in Riverside County and the surrounding area. Behavioral Health Division Responds to Changing Needs The Behavioral Health Division successfully responded to growing demand for inpatient care by adding 450 new acute inpatient psychiatric beds through new construction, expansion projects or the conversion of existing residential beds. We expect demand for inpatient care to continue now that healthcare reform requires that mental health services are a mandated benefit and must be treated equitably with medical and surgical services by all health plans. The division opened two new behavioral health hospitals in key markets. Austin Oaks Hospital offers acute psychiatric services to adults, adolescents, and children in Austin, Texas, while Garfield Park provides services for children and adolescents in Chicago. UHS Supports the Military UHS has always been a strong supporter of the military. Our Patriot Support Programs for active duty military, veterans and their families have grown with the integration of military support programs that were a part of our acquisition of the Ascend Health Corporation. In addition, we recently opened the new Cumberland Hall replacement facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky to provide support for military personnel at Fort Campbell. To help prevent suicide, UHS joined forces with The National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and UHS is working with the Alliance to help achieve its goal of a nation free from the tragic event of suicide. Quality Recognition Since its founding in 1979, Universal Health Services, Inc. has held true to its mission of providing superior quality healthcare services that patients recommend to their families and friends. In October, The Joint Commission released its list of Top Performers on Key Quality Measures® for 2012 and 48 UHS acute care and behavioral health facilities were on the list. Being recognized for the high quality of care we provide, as well as the number of patients who leave our facilities extremely satisfied with the treatment they received is very important to everyone who works at UHS. This recognition is a meaningful measure of achievement for us all. The management team at UHS is optimistic about the future of our company as well as the healthcare industry. As we mark the 35th anniversary of UHS, I am confident that we will continue our record of success for many years to come. I am grateful, on behalf of the thousands of patients we treat every year, for the efforts of the dedicated and committed people of our company.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2014,"2014 was an exceptional year for Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS). It was a year in which the company celebrated its 35th Anniversary, a milestone that is exceedingly rare in this age of mergers and acquisitions. It was a year in which the company’s net revenue reached $8.07 billion, the highest in its history. And, it was a year in which UHS was recognized both for the quality of medical care it provides and for its financial performance over the past three-and-a-half decades. It was also a year of dramatic change for the healthcare industry, with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) bringing insurance coverage to eight million Americans who had been previously uninsured. Along with the increased coverage, the ACA also brought stricter care and reimbursement requirements for healthcare providers. UHS’s results position it as one of the premier hospital management companies in the United States. Net revenue increased 10.7 percent, to $8.07 billion in 2014 compared to $7.28 billion in 2013. Adjusted net income attributable to UHS in 2014 increased 29 percent to $581.8 million, compared to $452.1 million in 2013. The company’s stock price appreciated 37 percent during the year, closing 2014 at $111.26 per share. In 2013, the company’s stock price had appreciated 68 percent and closed at $81.26 per share. ACUTE CARE: PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE Our Acute Care Division performed well in 2014 as it worked to successfully meet a number of challenges as we move into a future that will see reimbursement rates increasingly tied to quality measures and patient satisfaction scores. Through process improvement programs, developing best practices and adopting new technology, we have successfully introduced a number of programs that have increased the quality of care and patient satisfaction. We completed the successful implementation of Phase 2 of UHS FUSION, our electronic health records initiative, and we are well on the way toward completing the next phase. The company continues to invest in the growth of the Acute Care Division. The 140-bed Temecula Valley Hospital opened last year and is progressing well. The division broke ground for construction of Henderson Hospital in Henderson, Nevada. The new 142-bed acute care facility is slated for completion in 2016 and will be the sixth UHS acute care facility in the Las Vegas region. The division also began construction on three freestanding emergency departments in Texas, one in Laredo and two in the Rio Grande Valley, to make quality medical care more accessible to residents of the region. In Denison, Texas, the company built out the previously unused eighth floor of Texoma Medical Center to add 38 beds. The Acute Care Division implemented several programs designed to increase quality and improve patient satisfaction. Process improvement programs in our surgery departments have allowed us to virtually eliminate same-day surgery cancellations and reduce the amount of time it takes to prepare an operating room for its next patient to 28 minutes. New procedures in our emergency departments are reducing delays so that we can now meet our objective of 150 minutes from the time a patient is checked in to when he or she is discharged. 
UHS acquired Prominence Health Plan in 2014 to help prepare for narrow networks, which may evolve in the future as a way to reduce costs by limiting doctors and hospitals available to insurance subscribers. The new health plan offers a Medicare Advantage option in Nevada and Texas, as well as a commercial insurance product through the Nevada Health Care Exchange. Through its affiliations with Northern Nevada Medical Center, South Texas Health System and Northwest Texas Healthcare System, Prominence Health Plan continues to expand its care management programs. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: ACQUISITION AND GROWTH In September 2014, UHS acquired Cygnet Health Care Limited, one of the largest independent providers of behavioral health services in the United Kingdom. Through this acquisition, we added a total of 17 facilities and 1,450 employees throughout the UK. As demand for inpatient care continued to grow in the U.S., the Behavioral Health Division acquired two facilities, one in Washington, DC, and one in Tucson, Arizona. The Behavioral Health Division responded to the continuing demand for more acute inpatient beds brought on by healthcare reform, which requires that mental health services are covered by insurance and are treated equitably with medical and surgical services. To meet that need, the division added beds to existing facilities or converted existing residential beds for a total of more than 600 new acute inpatient psychiatric beds. RECOGNIZED FOR QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE Fortune magazine consistently lists UHS among the World’s Most Admired Companies, a respected report card on corporate reputation. Through hard work, dedication and service excellence, in 2014, UHS was ranked as the World’s Most Admired Company in the healthcare management industry, topping all of its competitors and second among all healthcare/medical facilities. In November, The Joint Commission released its list of Top Performers on Key Quality Measures® for 2013 and 46 UHS acute care and behavioral health facilities were on the list. This recognition, together with the number of patients who leave our facilities extremely satisfied with the treatment they received, is an important achievement for everyone who works at UHS. UHS was also recognized for its excellent financial performance. The company was included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which tracks the 500 most widely held stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, and is one of the world’s most followed stock market indices. The company also appeared on the list of Historical Extreme Winners in J.P. Morgan’s “Eye On The Market,” a historical perspective of the stock performance of companies on the Russell 3000 Index, which measures the performance of 3,000 of the largest publicly held U.S. companies. As part of that recognition, UHS was named as a stock that generated one of the highest excess lifetime returns over its 35-year history. 35 YEARS OF SUCCESS UHS built its success by remaining committed to rational growth around core businesses and seeking opportunities to complement those businesses, such as health insurance plans to supplement the Acute Care Division and acquiring behavioral assets in the UK. UHS will continue to focus on long-term goals and will take calculated risks to achieve them. The company will continue to cultivate new leaders who have high ethical standards, experience and are highly motivated to succeed. Those leaders will direct the company toward continued success, no matter what changes occur in the industry and will not waver from the company’s core commitment to provide superior quality healthcare to the patients and communities it serves. Our management team is confident that we will continue our record of success and believes that the initiatives being put into place now will provide the base for excellent performance for years to come. No doubt UHS will continue to perform as an industry leader. I greatly appreciate the efforts of our entire team as we provide patients with the highest possible quality of care.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2015,"Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS) had another excellent year in 2015, solidifying its position as a premier hospital management company in the USA. 2015 was one of the most exciting years in the company’s 36-year history. Patient satisfaction and quality scores continued to improve significantly. We completed behavioral health acquisitions that enhanced our position in the United Kingdom, as well as in the U.S. addiction recovery market. We worked to better meet the needs of the communities we serve by building new hospitals and expanding existing facilities, opening freestanding emergency departments and adding full-service pharmacies within acute care hospitals. The company’s financial performance was outstanding and our stock performed well, despite a sluggish market. We were recognized for the quality care we provide to patients and for providing over 70,000 employees with jobs that are among the most meaningful in the nation. Adjusted net income attributable to UHS in 2015 was $692.0 million, compared to $581.8 million in 2014. Net revenue increased 10.2 percent, to $9.04 billion in 2015 compared to $8.21 billion in 2014. The company’s stock price appreciated 7.4 percent during the year, closing 2015 at $119.49 per share. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) continued to have a positive impact, with 16.4 million Americans receiving healthcare coverage. We expect the benefits of the ACA will continue, though the rate of increase may be more incremental than it has been. ACUTE CARE DIVISION: INCREASING QUALITY To better meet the needs of the communities we serve, our Acute Care Division launched several initiatives. Construction continued on the new Henderson Hospital in Nevada. When it opens in 2016, Henderson Hospital will be our sixth hospital in the Las Vegas area. We also began construction of a new patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas. In Corona, California, we unveiled expansion plans for a new, larger emergency department at Corona Regional Medical Center. Corona Regional and Temecula Valley Hospital entered into affiliation agreements with the University of California Irvine Health and the University of California San Diego to provide residents there with the advanced healthcare they need. The Acute Care Division also opened freestanding emergency departments in Mission, Weslaco and Laredo, Texas, to give residents more convenient access to emergency medical care. A freestanding emergency department is scheduled to open in Amarillo in mid-2016. We opened our first CentRx Pharmacy at Texoma Medical Center in Denison, Texas, and followed with openings in our Las Vegas hospitals and at Northern Nevada Medical Center. The pharmacies provide employees, patients, their families and residents with a convenient option to get prescriptions filled, as well as purchase over-the-counter medications and other healthcare products. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: ACQUISITION AND EXPANSION The Behavioral Health Division acquired two companies that have proven track records for providing high-quality treatment. In August, we added Alpha Hospitals Holdings in the U.K. The addition of Alpha’s four facilities gives Cygnet Health Care 21 facilities with a total of 1,100 beds. Those facilities provide specialty mental health services to children, adolescents and adults. We acquired Foundations Recovery Network, LLC, based in Nashville, Tennessee, which added four residential treatment facilities and eight outpatient centers to the division. The new facilities are located throughout the USA and provide treatment for addiction and mental health conditions.
In July, we opened the Chris Kyle Patriots Hospital in Anchorage, Alaska. The hospital, named after the U.S. Navy SEAL who was the subject of the movie “American Sniper,” provides intensive, inpatient treatment for U.S. military service members and veterans who experienced trauma, or who need rehabilitation or detoxification for substance use. We are proud to provide mental health services to more than 5,000 active duty service members each year at our 27 Patriot Support Program facilities. The Behavioral Health Division responded to the demand for more acute inpatient services by adding 344 beds to existing facilities or converting existing residential treatment beds. Behavioral Health Integration Solutions is a new initiative in which the division partners with acute care hospitals to provide psychiatric services to emergency departments and other units through onsite treatment, mobile assessments and telemedicine. RECOGNIZED FOR QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE Fortune magazine consistently lists UHS among its World’s Most Admired Companies, the definitive report card on corporate reputation. Through hard work, dedication, service excellence and integrity, UHS was ranked second among all healthcare/ medical facilities. UHS was recognized as a “Most Honored Company” by Institutional Investor because of our corporate leadership, performance and expertise in investor relations. We were one of 136 organizations to receive this distinction after an intensive review of nearly 2,000 companies by portfolio managers and analysts. UHS was also named one of the “30 Most Meaningful Companies to Work for in America” by Business Insider after 78 percent of our employees rated their work as having “high job meaning.” In November, The Joint Commission released its list of Top Performers on Key Quality Measures® for 2014, and 46 UHS acute care and behavioral health facilities were on the list. This recognition, together with a 100 percent improvement in how patients rate our acute care hospitals, are important achievements for everyone who works at UHS. Our mission is to provide superior quality healthcare services that: patients recommend to family and friends, physicians prefer for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term returns. CONTINUING ON THE UHS PATH TO SUCCESS Several competitors are experiencing financial difficulty because they followed growth strategies that left them with significant debt levels, a problem that could get even worse if interest rates rise. UHS continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, and is able to pursue new business opportunities and acquisitions in acute care and behavioral health. We remain committed to a conservative policy of rational growth that supports our core businesses and helps the company achieve its long-term goals. Leadership is essential to our success, so UHS will continue to train new leaders who have high ethical standards, experience and are highly motivated to succeed. Those leaders will direct the company toward growth and will not waver from our core commitment to provide superior quality healthcare to the patients and communities we serve. Our management team is confident that we will continue our record of success and believes that the initiatives being put into place now will allow UHS to continue its excellent performance for years to come. I greatly appreciate the efforts of our entire team as we provide patients with the highest possible quality of care.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2016,"I am pleased to report that Universal Health Services (UHS) had another successful year in 2016, focused on patient care and driving quality clinical outcomes. Every day at UHS, we make patients our first priority. During the past year, the company served a record number of patients with superior care and treatment. That care, now provided at more than 319 hospitals and 33 outpatient and other treatment facilities, and the dedication of our more than 81,000 employees is what sets us apart and fuels our continued success. I am pleased to share this Annual Report with you to provide a sense of the progress that we made during the year in becoming the provider of choice in the communities we serve. CONSISTENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DESPITE CHALLENGES IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH In a challenging operating environment, our overall 2016 financial performance generally met our goals and objectives. Our Acute Care Division performed as expected, offsetting challenges which muted the results of the Behavioral Health Division related primarily to a shortage of clinicians in certain local markets. While this labor shortage is a national issue and is impacting other healthcare providers, we have been aggressively taking the steps necessary to address it. Throughout the year, the company continued making significant investments in our facilities and in our markets with an eye toward future growth. Looking ahead, we will face uncertainty driven by the recent election and its potential impact on the Affordable Care Act. Our strong financial position, experienced leadership team, and adaptable business strategy are all factors that will allow us to weather future challenges successfully. EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE Investing in our business has always been an important part of our strategy. We are continually looking for ways to expand our presence and grow in the communities we serve. Our efforts are deliberate and meant to improve our market position so that we can best serve patients. During 2016, for example, we acquired the Cambian Group Adult Services Division, a leading provider of specialty mental health services in the U.K. This strategic acquisition, which is subject to customary regulatory approval, adds 81 behavioral health facilities with nearly 1,200 beds to Cygnet, our existing business in the U.K., bringing us to a total of 102 facilities with approximately 2,250 beds. We view Cambian as a great fit with UHS because of its excellent reputation as a quality provider, and their shared commitment to patient care and clinical quality. We also view the U.K. market as increasingly attractive. ACUTE CARE DIVISION – EFFICIENCY, EXPANSION AND IMPROVING THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE In 2016, our Acute Care Division was focused squarely on efficiency, expansion and improving the patient experience. Highlights of the year include: • The opening of Henderson Hospital, a 130-bed hospital and our sixth acute care hospital in The Valley Health System, which provides care throughout Las Vegas and Southern Nevada; • The acquisition of Desert View Hospital, a 25-bed hospital in Pahrump, Nevada; • Completion of a new 55-bed patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas;
In Amarillo, Northwest Texas Healthcare System expanded services, opening a new freestanding emergency department, as well as two new urgent care centers to better serve the residents of the region; • At the Texoma Medical Center in Denison, Texas, where we are seeing growth in both the emergency room and outpatient visits, we broke ground on a new emergency department and patient tower. Our investments aren’t limited to acquisitions and construction. UHS is also committed to investing in cutting edge technology to improve patient safety. Henderson Hospital, for example, is the first hospital in the U.S. to purchase and install new technology including operating room light fixtures that keep patients safe by continuously disinfecting the environment. This technology has been clinically proven to reduce harmful bacteria up to 70 percent beyond routine disinfection efforts, and will become the new standard in our operating rooms. We are also proud of the strides we are making to improve the patient process and experience. For example, a new program at Lakewood Ranch Medical Center in Bradenton, Florida, has allowed us to significantly reduce the time it takes to admit a patient from the emergency room. We are sharing the processes developed as a best practice across the division. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIVISION – WORKING TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES The Behavioral Health Division has been focused on meeting the increasing demand for inpatient and outpatient mental health services. In addition to the Cambian acquisition mentioned previously, the Division also: • Formed a joint venture with Lancaster General Health and Penn Medicine to build and operate a 126-bed behavioral health hospital in Lancaster, PA. The new facility will be constructed during 2017 and is expected to open in early 2018; • Formed a joint venture with Providence Health Care to build a 100-bed freestanding behavioral health hospital in Spokane, Washington; • Opened five new Patriot Support Centers to help veterans struggling with the effects of combat, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other post-deployment issues. UHS CONTINUES TO BE A RECOGNIZED LEADER AND IT’S BECAUSE OF OUR PEOPLE Thirty-eight years ago, my hope was to build a company that would make a difference in the lives of the people we serve. It is very gratifying that once again this year UHS has been recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of its “Most Admired” companies. Fortune is just one recent metric that UHS is recognized as a leader, and there are many others. I view it as a reflection on the people throughout UHS who make it their mission every day to put patients first while delivering high quality healthcare. These are the two cornerstones of UHS, but they are made real by the dedication of our 81,000 employees. Thank you for your continuing interest in UHS.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2017,"2017 marked another year of solid performance.
In spite of volatile market conditions, we remained steadfast, made prudent investments and delivered the kind of care our patients need and expect of us, each and every day – across all the markets we serve. 
For nearly 40 years, Universal Health Services (NYSE: UHS)
has been recognized as a leader in the healthcare management industry. National, state and local organizations continue to honor UHS employees and facilities for achieving high outcome clinical measures and quality metrics, and for our commitment to community service. 
I am proud that UHS has again been recognized
as one of the ‘World’s Most Admired Companies’ by Fortune magazine, that we rank #276 on
the Fortune 500 list, and that UHS made Forbes’ inaugural list of America’s Top 500 Public Companies. Our consistent recognition is testament to the tremendous work done every day by our 83,000 employees and their commitment to exceptional patient care – treating the mental 
and physical health of our patients. 
With a strong portfolio focusing on physical health, mental health, an insurance offering, a physician network, and various related service offerings – and a partnership strategy that aligns us with other leaders in our markets – we are well-poised for continued growth. 
2017 – SERVING PATIENTS IN THE AFTERMATH OF VIOLENCE 
UHS was in a unique position to respond to the critical needs of the communities we serve across the nation. In June, the George Washington University Hospital delivered aid in the aftermath of the ambush at the congressional baseball practice. In early October, our healthcare professionals at the six Las Vegas area UHS hospitals provided life-saving care to those injured during the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. 
We responded heroically in treating and caring for a total of 232 patients who arrived in our emergency departments. 
UHS personnel and facilities also supported areas impacted by national disasters during a record hurricane season with major storms hitting Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and other islands in the Gulf of Mexico. Once again, members of the UHS team met the challenge of providing care and saving lives in very challenging environments. 
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIVISION – MORE CARE FOR MORE PATIENTS 
Today, we operate nearly 300 behavioral health facilities in 37 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the United Kingdom. 
During the past year, the Behavioral Health Division continued to expand the delivery of care nationally and internationally – providing more services to more patients. The cornerstone of our growth is our ability to identify and execute on strategic opportunities. 
In the U.K., we received a favorable regulatory decision from the Competition and Markets Authority review of the Cambian Adult Services acquisition. We immediately initiated the process of fully integrating the newly acquired facilities under Cygnet Health Care, hereby becoming one of the largest providers in the U.K. With a total of 108 facilities, including a brand new 56-bed facility in Coventry, we offer a full spectrum of behavioral health services and capabilities. 
In the U.S., the Behavioral Health Division added 471 inpatient psychiatric beds via expansions, acquisition and new construction in 2017. Looking ahead to 2018, we are particularly proud of the joint venture partnerships with the University of Pennsylvania and with Providence Health, for which new hospitals are currently under construction in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Spokane, Washington, respectively. 
Lastly, UHS proudly demonstrates its commitment to members of the military and their families through its Patriot Support Program, which treated 6,500 individuals in 2017. We are very proud to offer this Program as a national network of now 24 behavioral treatment centers across 
13 states dedicated to treating active military, veterans and their families to help them cope with the emotional and psychological effects of combat and related triggers. They deserve all that our professionals can offer. 
ACUTE CARE DIVISION – GROWTH AND EXPANSIONS 
Our Acute Care results are strong – and our trajectory is healthy. Of particular note, we led the industry in our admissions growth, meaning that more patients and more physicians are choosing UHS hospitals. 
2017 saw expansions in a number of our facilities and the growth continues. For example, since
the opening of Temecula Valley Hospital in October of 2013 the growth in patient volume has been remarkable. As a result, the hospital is now
in the midst of a $40 million expansion project to include additional operating rooms, cath labs, and additional radiological imaging systems that will allow the hospital to continue to meet the growing demand in the community. This project is expected to be completed and operational by Q3, 2018. 
And in Southern California at Corona Regional Medical Center, we are investing $38 million to add 15,000 square feet of space, a total of 30 new treatment beds. 
We increased the accessibility and expanded
the delivery of emergency care services in a number of our markets with a turnkey design and construction model for Freestanding Emergency Departments, which are separate entities yet strategically affiliated with our nearby full- service hospitals. 
POISED FOR CONTINUED SUCCESS 
UHS’ leadership team and I are confident that the company is well-positioned to continue to deliver superior quality patient care, attract and retain talented healthcare professionals as an employer of choice and contribute meaningfully to our local communities. 
By focusing on our core strategies and initiatives, remaining adaptable and meeting the needs of our constituents, we look forward to continued success in 2018 and in the future.

Universal Health Services,UHS,Healthcare,2018,"For Universal Health Services, 2018 marked another year of healthy performance. As one of the largest publicly traded healthcare management companies in the United States, with a strong and diverse portfolio of hospital-based care, ambulatory care, behavioral health, an insurance offering, a physician network and various related services, we believe we are well positioned for continued growth.
Dear Valued Shareholders, As we reflect upon 2018, I am pleased to report another year of growth, expansion, excellence in care delivery and solid performance. We continue to execute on our long-term strategies of prioritizing high quality patient care, investing in our people, serving our local communities, driving operational excellence and growing profitably. In 2018, UHS generated net revenues of $10.772 billion, an increase of 3.5% over 2017. On a same facility basis, adjusted admissions increased 2.1% for Acute Care hospitals and 3.0% for Behavioral Health facilities. Highlights in Behavioral Health include the acquisition of The Danshell Group in the United Kingdom, complementing our existing assets operating under the Cygnet Health Care brand, now expanded with the addition of certain specialized services and a broadened geographical footprint. In the United States, we continued to engage with noted not-for-profit organizations in joint venture partnerships, leveraging our expertise and scale in behavioral health and substance abuse treatment. We opened two new joint-venture freestanding behavioral health facilities this year – Lancaster Behavioral Health Hospital (in partnership with Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health, part of the University of Pennsylvania Health System) and Inland Northwest Behavioral Health (in partnership with Providence Health Care) – and signed three new agreements, with over 40 promising projects in the pipeline. And among our existing facilities, we added a total of 508 new beds and expanded program offerings to help meet the growing needs of local community populations. Among our Acute Care hospitals, we completed a number of significant facility expansions and renovations, added new service lines and acquired innovative technologies to support the advancement of care provided by our clinicians. We continued to invest in access points within our networks that provide increased convenience and choice to our patients. Eight freestanding emergency departments are currently operational, an additional seven are slated to open in 2019 and others across our markets have received investment approval and are on the future horizon. Looking ahead, broader ambulatory strategies are a key priority, whether through organic growth, acquisition or partnership. I am proud of the reputation we have earned as a leader in the healthcare management industry. For the ninth consecutive year, UHS was recognized among the ‘World’s Most Admired Companies’ by Fortune magazine. UHS is currently ranked #268 on the Fortune 500 list, and our employees and facilities continue to be honored by national, state and local organizations for achievement of high clinical quality outcomes, for their clinical expertise and for their commitment to serving our local communities. We look ahead with great optimism. In 2019, we will continue to focus on our core strategies, remain adaptable to the changing healthcare environment and consistently deliver upon our mission. Simply said, we are committed to continuing our tradition of excellence.

United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2004,"By conventional standards of measurement, UnitedHealth Group achieved strong performance across its diverse set of businesses in 2004. But as important as financial results are, they alone do not fully convey the tangible advances in our efforts to promote optimal health for all people. Perhaps most gratifying is the measurable progress UnitedHealth Group continues to make toward addressing key challenges in health care. This is being realized by marshaling unparalleled capabilities in organizing resources, developing and applying technology, and using data to enhance knowledge across a diverse set of markets. The strategic focus of our company, which has remained unchanged for more than a decade and a half, centers on making the health care system — a system rich in capability, but consistently inefficient, variable in its results and challenging in its accessibility — work better. Over these years, we have held fast to our key beliefs in offering choice and access, simplifying the health care experience, promoting safe and evidence-based medicine, facilitating care for people and, ultimately, improving affordability. These core principles and elements — focused on the needs of the marketplace rather than a particular product or capability — have served as our impetus to pursue innovations and opportunities across the full spectrum of the health and well-being arena. In so doing, we have had a meaningful impact on advancing health and well-being for the constituencies we serve. The shared commitment of our employees, regardless of individual responsibilities or involvement in a particular business unit, is that in everything we do we must ultimately address the basic needs of our customers. More than ever, we are committed to making the needs of customers our priority, and to further act on what we have long believed. 
While these objectives have been present in the past, we have refined our focus around four imperatives. Our individual and collective activities will be relentlessly directed at achieving: > Higher quality and better health outcomes, > Affordability of services, > Accessibility to care, and > Ease of use of benefits and services. By addressing these fundamental needs, and thereby excluding all other distractions and activities that do not align with these imperatives, we effectively dedicate our resources and capabilities to the needs of our customers and, in turn, help create a more efficient, progressive, fair and compassionate health care system for everyone. Our efforts to date have been fruitful. We have succeeded in meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse set of clients and market segments, and this has allowed us to provide meaningful advances for our shareholders as well: > Strong revenue growth has been driven by an expanding customer base, which has accessed both new and established services. > Health care cost trends have been contained through an array of services and programs designed to reduce inappropriate variation in care, increase the use of necessary services and more effectively purchase services critical to those in need. > Operating margins have continued to expand as gains from the practical application of technology have increased service quality and efficiency, and simultaneously lowered costs. > Strong cash flows from operations have been generated by attention to best business practices. We have effectively utilized these strong cash resources to support operations, fund research and development activities, invest in innovations for the future, and support worthy social activities — documented by the company’s strong return on equity, business expansion and continuing growth.
These results aside, it remains our belief that health care must work better, should be easier and simpler to use, and must be accessible for all people. As a society and a nation, we have not worked hard enough on this agenda. Our aspirations and actions are too modest, and our pace lacks appropriate urgency given the costs in both human suffering and the national economic resources we currently expend. We believe the efforts of UnitedHealth Group and others are important to meeting the broad challenges related to health and well-being that affect our society, as well as those beyond our domestic borders. Certainly, our company alone cannot solve the significant issues surrounding health care for all citizens. That will require mutual participation by all parties involved in health care, particularly physicians and other providers of care, employers, government, intermediaries and consumers. While we urge these collective efforts to accelerate, we will move ahead with urgency. UnitedHealth Group has been — and will continue to be — an important innovator and advocate for addressing the issues of quality, affordability, accessibility and usability in health care. Given our position and the potential before us, we are optimistic about the future. We have the tools, the capacity, the desire and, above all, the commitment of our people. Innovations, services and products from UnitedHealth Group have provided meaningful value to people across a broad set of health-related needs. We intend to continue our tradition of challenging the past in pursuit of a better future and remain confident that the beliefs and strategies we have long pursued will continue to yield positive results.

United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2006,"The dramatic change taking place in health care today is that, increasingly, individuals choose, purchase and manage their own health care coverage and are much more personally involved in making decisions about their preventive behavior, as well as the cost, quality and appropriateness of health care. Changing individual behavior is driving new technology applications, reshaping products, rationalizing distribution, defining costs and setting measurable, higher quality standards. The consumer is melting the historical boundaries of health care and opening new markets and opportunities. We are embracing the new dynamics of an evolving consumer-centric market by focusing on six key areas: We are making consumers the focal point of everything we do. The “end-user” will determine care delivery relationships and judge the service experience. People’s needs will drive where our capital is applied, the technological changes we pursue, how models for decision-making information are shaped, and how health care education and coaching are delivered, enhancing the consumer’s clinical relationship and our role in it. Continuing to diversify is imperative on both micro and macro levels. We are moving into emerging market segments — ethnic markets and demographic niches, new group aggregations, customized product types and innovative funding approaches. On the macro level, UnitedHealth Group sees opportunities to diversify into care provider services, government and financial services, and global pharmaceutical, device and safety services. We believe our diversified portfolio positions us to serve in virtually every sector of the health care market. We are focusing our technological expertise to better serve people with simple, reliable technology solutions, creating front-end consumer versions of everything we offer. Today, integration means bringing together all clinical services and interactions, all information, all operations, all financial capabilities and all customized consumer services into a single, technology-enabled “consumer experience.” And that experience must be engaging, intuitive and personalized. Industry forces are also driving the growth of unique health care financial services. UnitedHealth Group has a significant “first mover” advantage in consumer health financial services with Exante Financial Services. In commercial services, we are at the very early stages of establishing a financial transaction clearinghouse to serve a new era of transactional advances in health care. Enterprise-wide we are reforming and cultivating our long-standing competencies to serve expanding market needs. We know we must take these competencies to the next level. Making our capabilities work for people on their terms will help them, and will also work for UnitedHealth Group from a growth and financial performance perspective. Finally, we are embracing a corporate culture that thrives on change, social responsibility and ethical behavior. This is not something that is new for us, but it is a critical area where we need to make greater investment and have even greater emphasis. We must be known for high integrity and high performance. It is also important to recognize what is not changing at UnitedHealth Group. We remain true to our pursuit of clinical excellence, to evidence-based care, to facilitate and improve the health system, to the respect we hold for patient/physician relationships, and to consumer choice and access. In our business, we will continue to price to our cost; to achieve a fair return on capital investment; and to pursue excellence in execution and performance, and maintain rigorous discipline. Throughout 2006, the people of UnitedHealth Group have focused on our mission-driven priorities as a health and well-being company. Despite challenging circumstances, they have remained dedicated to making health care work better and have continued to deliver the innovation, service and performance our customers, business partners and investors expect of this Company. Our work continued to help improve the quality of care Americans received and to make their health care more cost-effective. We accelerated health care affordability through more effective cost management and broader availability of products and access to care. We also continued our long-standing operating business discipline. Our unique clinical approaches are increasingly sophisticated and effective. The innovative technology and information capabilities of our enterprise continue to help us understand what is happening in health care delivery and to creatively put that information to work on behalf of those we serve.
UnitedHealth Group’s results in 2006 were characterized by strong organic revenue growth of 21 percent, supplemented by the late 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare, pricing of risk-based medical coverages consistent with underlying medical cost trends and disciplined operating cost management: > Our 2006 revenue of $71.5 billion represents a 54 percent gain over 2005; > Earnings from operations of almost $7 billion were up 37 percent year over year; > Cash flows from operations increased 60 percent to approximately $6.5 billion; > Net earnings of nearly $4.2 billion were up 35 percent from 2005; and > Earnings per share increased to $2.97 per share. The Company provided major medical coverage and related care facilitation services to about 1.5 million more people and launched Medicare Part D prescription drug plans that reached a total of 5.7 million seniors by year end — who saved in excess of $14 billion in outof-pocket expenses in 2006 by utilizing these plans. The Company also brought ancillary or specialty benefits and services to 2.7 million new people in its specialty businesses, grew its consumer-directed plan offerings to reach a total of nearly 2 million people at year end, saw 21 percent growth in its health information technology and services businesses and helped individuals open thousands of new dedicated health banking accounts. We interact directly with everyone in the health care environment, end-to-end — patients, doctors, hospitals, employer-payers — and this breadth and scale enables us to manage efficiency and quality of treatment, physician and hospital costs, and drug and technology costs. Of particular importance, we have real-time, intimate involvement in the lives of people when they are in need. As people take more control of their health, we are in a position to help empower them to make the best choices, to help coordinate care and disease management and to support their preventive behavior. Our complete and integrated clinical data can be translated into information for action — getting the right treatment to the right individual, improving quality, safety and appropriateness of care. Perhaps one of the best examples of the effectiveness of the combination of consumercentric principles, innovative technology, analytical rigor and social consciousness is the success of the United Health Foundation’s multiyear support for community clinics in medically underserved communities. In each clinic participating in the program, the emphasis is on preventive care, coordination of care and the use of nationally recognized standards of treatment, tailored to the unique needs of each community in collaboration with local care
providers. These clinics are replicable across the country, yet each is responsive to the unique circumstances in the community it serves. The four clinics, operating in New York, Washington, D.C., Florida and Louisiana, were evaluated in 2006 in an independent study conducted by George Washington University. The study confirms that the quality of care in each of the “centers of excellence” meets or exceeds care provided in the private sector. United Health Foundation commissioned the study based on our posture of careful evaluation of everything we do as a business. We believe social and philanthropic activities must be pursued with that same accountability and discipline and should produce measurable, positive results. UnitedHealth Group also remains committed, as we have always been, to more equitably and effectively delivering quality health care to uninsured Americans. In 2006 we joined 16 of the nation’s most influential health care organizations to form the Health Coverage Coalition for the Uninsured (HCCU). Despite divergent political and ideological views that exist among the members of this coalition, we have committed to jointly press lawmakers to act on HCCU’s proposal to significantly expand health coverage for our nation’s uninsured, starting immediately with expanded coverage for children in 2007. We hope this concerted effort by a diverse array of business, professional and charitable groups will mark an important turning point. In the past year, we have come through a period of momentous change as a company. We will be addressing for some time the issues that arose in the past year. They have become a catalyst for a maturing culture that embraces high ethical, social and business standards. We understand that ongoing evolution — constant change — is a fundamental and positive element of the health care industry. UnitedHealth Group is a highly adaptive enterprise that is changing at or above the speed of the market to remain competitive. Looking ahead, it is clear that there is increasingly stronger growth and performance potential within our enterprise. We believe it is also clear that we have the talent, the positioning, the agility and drive to help realize that great potential for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.

United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2008,"Dear Shareholder, The American people are questioning the value we receive as a society for the $2.4 trillion we collectively spend in our health care system annually. While our nation has long excelled in important aspects of modern medical care — the resources to treat complex diseases or to respond to critical health events are among the best in the world — in other areas of our health care system there is much more to be done, and that has been true for too long. Because of this, the nation’s focus on the critical objective of health care modernization is rapidly escalating. UnitedHealth Group has been a strong advocate of health care coverage for all Americans. For many years our enterprise has been deeply involved in the work of improving the health care system. Better health care is both our business and our social mission. The theme of this 2008 annual report is delivering value in health care in ways that meet the varying expectations of UnitedHealth Group’s many stakeholders — the same stakeholders of the American health care system itself. This report provides a window into some of the work and creativity we combine to advance the interests of our stakeholders, as we strive to make the health care system work better for everyone. UnitedHealth Group builds value through greater affordability and quality; expanding access to care; and through innovation, such as in the market transition to consumerism, caring for aging and chronic disease populations and using information and technology to modernize health care services and improve benefi t designs. We deliver value by controlling health care costs, by introducing new, more effi cient technology and by helping to simplify an increasingly complex health care world. We create this value through our people — more than 75,000 talented individuals who are passionate about our mission to help people live healthier lives. Our enterprise is organized to address the highly complex health care system itself through a business model that is intentionally broad, diverse and adaptable, enabling us to leverage strengths and balance challenges in a wide range of circumstances. Our model allows us to endure stress and change. As the health care system evolves, we can adapt to participate in new opportunities. 
Our health benefi ts businesses consist of UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice. UnitedHealthcare serves the commercial market landscape for large, medium-sized and small employers and those students and individuals who buy their own benefi ts — with one of the most comprehensive lines of product offerings in the market. Our Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses each are market leaders serving government sponsors of health benefi ts — Medicare, Medicaid, State Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and more. Our health services businesses consist of OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions. OptumHealth is rapidly emerging as the premiere comprehensive care management and services company, ideally suited for the emerging consumer-driven health era. OptumHealth Financial Services is a dedicated health care banking business, the embodiment of the modern convergence of the health care and fi nancial sectors. Ingenix is among America’s largest commercial enterprises dedicated to providing clinical health care data, analytics, research and consulting services to participants in the health care system. Prescription Solutions is among the largest pharmacy benefi t managers in the United States. Common to the success of our businesses are three long-standing core competencies, areas in which we have cultivated market-leading capabilities: · Our ability to effectively and effi ciently organize and manage complex health delivery systems and integrate expert care management capabilities to source the right care to each individual patient from the right care provider and location, to drive the best possible outcome from a quality and cost perspective; · Our vast technological infrastructure, which provides the ability to conduct and integrate literally billions of data elements and millions of transactions of enormous variety and complexity on a routine, daily basis at very low cost; and · Our capability to analyze, model and act on information — to use it strategically to advance health care performance on many levels. We have focused on these three foundational assets for more than three decades, and they have served the health care system and our own enterprise well. Throughout our corporate history, we have been at the forefront of virtually every innovation in the health care system and a leader in helping implement government reform of health care.
In 2008, UnitedHealth Group did not achieve the consistency of operating and performance results that has been our aspiration and our hallmark. For example, we did not produce year-over-year growth in net earnings per share for the fi rst time in many years. Our response has been swift and decisive, and the work has enhanced our position for 2009: · We have reduced operating costs by better sharing common resources across the enterprise; · We have achieved more effective and consistent clinical performance and medical cost management, which are critical to affordable, quality health care. We are containing medical costs through the introduction of new tools that leverage our vast information databases and better address variations in the delivery of care, while strengthening the consistent application of evidence-based medicine and expert physician guidance to care management; · We have further advanced our commitment to a culture of service that is deep and broad, and which strengthens our relationships with everyone we touch in the health care continuum. We are building their trust in us — trust that we will do the right thing and do it effi ciently, thoughtfully, consistently and in a timely manner; and · We have accelerated the already strong pace of innovation across our businesses, better focusing our resources to provide personalized health care benefi ts and services at lower costs. The results of our efforts have strengthened our market position and fi nancial performance. While we are cautious in our outlook, given the general economic uncertainties, we are optimistic about our performance in 2009. We are hopeful that efforts to modernize the health care system in America will be moving forward at an accelerated pace in the next few years. We support the principle of universal coverage for all Americans. Yet, we understand that simply changing the “coverage protocols” or the “funding pools” won’t resolve the core issues. If we are to improve and modernize the system in essential and sustainable ways, we have to think broadly and focus on the root causes of uncontrolled health care costs and the other basic challenges the system faces. 
As a nation, we will have to address rapidly escalating health care costs, an unacceptable level of uninsured citizens, uneven quality and ineffi cient uses of care, care for those with chronic diseases, and the wide variations in the effectiveness of care. We must align payment systems, modernize and standardize health technology, strengthen primary care to improve medical outcomes, introduce meaningful litigation reform, and work with communities and individuals to change unhealthy lifestyles and behaviors to prevent disease and promote health. Our 2001 Letter to Shareholders called for fundamental reform of the health care system and universal access. Elements of that letter remain highly relevant today: · “…we must promote a process that clearly defi nes what constitutes a basic health benefi t package, and then work to deliver these basic benefi ts to everyone.” · “…the administrative components of health care services need across-theboard simplifi cation and standardization.” · “…evidence-based medicine should be upheld as the standard of quality.” · “…health consumers must receive better information and decision-support tools as they participate, along with their physicians, in making health care decisions.” We sent that letter to every member of Congress. We did that because a more modern and effective approach to health care is important for our nation, good for American business and good for the consumers of health care, as well. Reform and broad changes in health care have taken place in the past, at both the federal and state levels, and we have helped drive and enable many of those reforms. History confi rms that changes of this nature have almost always resulted in expanded opportunities for those who anticipate and embrace change. UnitedHealth Group was built on this premise and has fl ourished on health care reform and our innovative response to change.
So, when you think of UnitedHealth Group, think of us as a modern, innovative, proactive company in benefi t design, in systems, data, analytics and technology, looking for inclusive solutions to modernize health care and make it simpler, more effective and more affordable for everyone. We are dedicated to fi nding ways to increase the value we provide to our shareholders, to meet our customers’ changing needs and to participate in the larger effort to improve the health care system for all Americans. Leading companies keep moving forward during periods of disruptive change and challenging market conditions. That is what we intend to do. There remains a huge opportunity for our company to continue to advance care for people and create value in health care for society. As we execute on that — delivering real value to the health care community — our shareholders and all stakeholders in the health care community will prosper.

United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2009,"In 2009, the people of UnitedHealth Group delivered a strong performance while advancing our mission to help people live healthier lives, despite a very difficult economy. We demonstrated consistency in effectively managing medical costs and continued to reduce our own operating costs. Our businesses again steadily delivered in service and practical innovation. We continued to combine national scale with local responsiveness and further diversified our products, services and markets. We built stronger relationships with the people we serve across the health care community. Our balance sheet grew stronger — our investments performed well and our leverage decreased.
As a result, we entered 2010 a much stronger enterprise. We are positioned for the next generation of growth, in both health benefits and health services. While we cannot predict what changes ultimately will be introduced to the health care system, we understand that in any setting we must combine consistent fundamental execution with our proven ability to adapt to core market demands and continuously innovate in practical ways across the health care experience. The extraordinary, national debate over the future of health care in the United States serves to shine a spotlight on a key challenge: How do we modernize the health care system, in a fiscally responsible manner, to make quality health care accessible and affordable for all Americans? Finding innovative, practical and financially responsible answers to that question has been our objective for more than two decades. This annual 
report highlights just a handful of the many ways we are helping create a more modern and effective health care system. We continue to make it easier for people to get the care they need, to personalize and simplify their health care experience, to strengthen the bonds between patients and their physicians, to foster the introduction of modern technology and to find new ways to control the rising costs of health care. These advances are critically important. As we move into the next decade, we believe positive, competitive pressures and ever-growing demands from individuals and employers, physicians and medical facilities and state and federal governments will open the health care system to even greater change … change that will accelerate the evolution of new products and services and costeffective new technologies, spurring even more rapid modernization of our health care system. The changes we envision include: • Common administrative standards and enabling technology will connect and unify patients, health care providers, health benefit plans and the entire health care sector. Actionable information will be available electronically to help physicians and patients make better decisions together. • Evidence-based medicine will become widely accepted and consistently practiced, improving care quality and helping to control costs. • Transparency, performance accountability and comparative effectiveness will be adopted across all care services, just as they are in other sectors of the economy. • Americans will become better informed consumers of health services, because there will be personalized motivations to be engaged, including financial incentives. • Better management of care, driven by education, adherence to evidencebased medicine and aligned incentives for patients and health care providers, along with supporting information and technologies, will become ubiquitous to health care, built right into the core of how medicine is practiced rather than existing as a parallel “administrative” function as it is today. • Health care will adopt a culture of prevention that promotes good health rather than simply treating illnesses as they are presented in the doctor’s office or the emergency room.
• There will be a new focus on the challenges of helping people cope with chronic disease, as well as the importance of health and wellness programs that can prevent the onset of those conditions for many years or a lifetime. • Health care will be purchased based on the effectiveness of achieving health outcomes, not the volume of services rendered. • All health care transactions will follow the lead of the financial industry and become totally electronic. • Public health plans, like Medicare and Medicaid, will be modernized to become more economically viable for the long term and enable better care. The modernization of Medicare is perhaps the greatest area of opportunity to positively influence health care nationally, as well as to improve our financial outlook as a nation. These changes to our health care system will promote a positive health agenda for our nation and a positive growth agenda for a company with the range of capabilities, market positions, capital strength and experience of UnitedHealth Group. Our business model and philosophy are designed to align with and help enable this national path into a better health care future. We are already delivering many of these modernizations to the marketplace. We have developed and invested in innovative technologies that bring the health care sector into the 21st century. We pioneered the financial services market for health care. We are a leader in the introduction of consumer-focused benefits and services, and we have more integrated and performance-based care delivery payment relationships than anyone else in health care. As we have for a decade, we continue to develop and enrich our three core competencies, which are the building blocks of a better health care system: • Information — to guide and lead; • Technology — to enable, simplify and modernize; and • Expertise in clinical access and management — to consistently deliver higher quality, lower cost and consumer affordability in health care. We leverage these competencies to help the health care system perform to its potential. Quite simply, we are helping to create the infrastructure and capabilities that will enable a modernized American health care system to take root and function more effectively for all participants.
And as we help lead and adapt to change, we are meaningfully deepening our culture as a company to better serve the vital social needs of health care. This is apparent in externally measured satisfaction levels among key stakeholders and in the trust we continue to build with those we touch in the health care community. Engagement among our employees increased significantly in 2009, on top of substantial gains in 2008. Set against the challenging business and political climate this year, this is a testament to the spirit and commitment of our people to our mission. In 2010 we plan to further strengthen and diversify our competitive capabilities to deliver more consistent organic growth and further market expansion across our businesses. We will remain focused on executing on the fundamentals, prepared to further elevate our performance in medical and operating cost management and deliver an even better experience and value to the markets we serve. Over the next year, you will see our benefits businesses become even more integrated within a more streamlined organization with razor-sharp cost and price sensitivities. Our benefits offerings will become more tightly aligned behind the strong UnitedHealthcare brand name, while the businesses themselves remain distinct, market-facing organizations, dedicated to the differing needs of the benefit markets we serve — commercial, senior and public benefits. Our health services businesses will fully concentrate on helping the whole health system modernize and perform better. These businesses have been expanding to address the needs of the care delivery side over the past two years. We expect the pace of this expansion will accelerate. The U.S. health care market will move forward and grow, driven by the need of our society for sustainable care, for even more effective cost controls and for better overall system performance. UnitedHealth Group is ready to help make health care more accessible and affordable, and take a leading role in our nation’s efforts to modernize health care. In the years to come, it will be our progressive adaptability that will translate into high performance and distinctive value for our customers and our shareholders.

United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2010,"Dear shareholder: In 2010, the elevated focus on the U.S. health care system—both its greatness and its shortcomings—was striking.
There is a growing national will to address core issues in the health care system to make it work better for everyone. Recognition of the need for fundamental change makes this a time of signifi cant challenge and opportunity for the modernization of health care. We see new markets opening, new opportunities to serve and new growth for our enterprise. For three decades, we have worked to develop innovative, practical and fi nancially responsible ways to make higher quality health care more accessible and affordable for more people. We focus on making it easier for people to get the care they need, personalizing and simplifying their health care experience, strengthening the bonds between patients and physicians, modernizing technology to improve consistency and connectivity among all the participants in health care and fi nding new ways to improve quality while controlling the rising costs of health care. In 2010, this approach to serving people in health care enabled us to exceed our growth goals. Our revenue grew by 8 percent, or $7 billion, reaching $94 billion in 2010. We met our fi nancial commitments for 2010 and introduced a meaningful dividend to our shareholders. Our Health Benefi ts businesses are growing. In 2010, our benefi ts businesses were privileged to serve a million more people than in 2009. They also transitioned smoothly and successfully to a single, unifying brand name, UnitedHealthcare. Our benefi ts platform has strong growth capacity, across geographies, products and benefi t sponsors. Millions more people will be entering the market for health benefi ts over the next several years and the UnitedHealthcare brand and its capabilities will make it simple and easy for all our customers to understand the value we offer through every stage in life.
Our Health Services businesses, under the new Optum brand name, are growing. OptumInsight, OptumHealth and OptumRx delivered combined revenue growth of 15 percent year-over-year. Expanding benefi t coverage, increasing government oversight and new legislation are creating needs we can meet for connectivity, expanded care capacity, clinical accountability and transparency, and more consumer affordability. Greater cost pressures are impacting the entire health care system. In 2010, we aligned our Health Services businesses more closely to better serve this huge emerging market among governments, care providers, payers and other participants in the care system. Health Services will not focus on the domestic market alone. Our broad services capabilities are also the leading edge of our company’s continuing international expansion. In 2010, we continued to focus, as we have over the last several years, on consistent fundamental execution. As a result, UnitedHealth Group’s measures of service and responsiveness were high and continued to trend upward. Our care provider relationships and clinical programs have never been more consistent, more integrated or offered greater economic value. Our cost and capital management disciplines, strong integration and modernization efforts, and our growth, distribution and market engagement programs have never been more mature. The time is right to begin to tell our story. We launched Health in Numbers, an image and reputation campaign for UnitedHealth Group, and the initial response has been strongly positive. Our growing role in making the health care system work aligns with our growing and deeper involvement in people’s health and health care. That relationship, in such a socially and personally sensitive part of their lives, must be built on trust. We are committed to putting ourselves in the shoes of the people we serve, delivering not only high performance, but compassion and dependability properly matched to the enabling role we will play in the future of this nation’s health care. Within each of our businesses, we are redoubling our efforts to develop and promote innovative thinking, along with the processes to efficiently translate new ideas into scalable reality. The results are new product designs and network and payment approaches, new ways to engage people in their health and health care and drive better consumer choices, and the application of new technology to simplify the health care experience end-to-end for both consumers and care providers. We are building new relationships to help us reach and serve people from different perspectives, like our collaborations with Sesame Street, the YMCA, LPL Financial, the National Restaurant Association, National Football League’s New England Patriots franchise, Walgreens and Cisco. This report highlights a number of the innovations we introduced in 2010. Our forward momentum is strong and we are optimistic as we enter 2011 and begin to prepare for continued growth in 2012 and beyond. The next wave of growth opportunities will come to those who fundamentally help make the health care system work better, in a more sustainable way. We believe UnitedHealth Group is well positioned to meet that challenge. We serve people—we support the health care needs of more than 75 million people in the United States and around the globe and help enable the 14 million people who work in the U.S. health system to do their jobs more effectively, every day. As we address the needs of the people we serve—better and more consistently than other market alternatives—we diversify and grow. UnitedHealth Group has never been better prepared, more engaged or more committed to help people live healthier lives and to advance a positive health care agenda in the United States and worldwide. I would like to thank the people of UnitedHealth Group for their outstanding performance this year in serving our customers. We offer our thanks to you, our shareholders, for your continuing support. 

"
United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2011,"In 2011, the people of UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare again delivered sound operational and financial performance — distinctive in the consistency of their execution, the breadth and depth of both top line and bottom line growth, and in the diversity of their efforts across the health care landscape. The hard work and creativity of our people is steadily advancing the quality and value this enterprise delivers to those we serve and those who invest in us.
Today, there are almost 100,000 deeply committed, talented and resourceful people who work across this enterprise to achieve this level of performance and to position us for an even more positive future. This letter is one of the few public opportunities to recognize and thank all of them for these efforts. At this point, annual report convention dictates we launch into several pages about that strong 2011 performance and the distinctive attributes of this enterprise. Make no mistake, we grew and performed well, and our differentiating value advanced meaningfully. But, our thinking and energies have long since turned from 2011 and are fully engaged with 2012 and 2013. So what feels right to do as we strive toward higher levels of performance in 2012 is to renew with you some core commitments shared and acted on every day by the people of this enterprise that drive our performance regardless of the year. We remain committed to our mission to society at large and to our role within the health care community. Our mission is to help people live healthier lives. Our role is to make the health care system work better for everyone. • We are committed to integrity and ethical behavior in everything we do and to high standards of corporate governance. • We are committed to accountability in performance. This means relentless execution on the fundamentals and in the details of everything we do, so the expectations of those we serve and those we work with across the health care system are consistently met and exceeded. • We are committed to innovation in everything we touch — practical innovation that benefits customers, consumers and the health care community. Our efforts are focused on advancing and modernizing the health care system in both large and small ways, conserving its resources and helping the system serve more Americans more effectively, more consistently and at lower cost. • We are committed to working collaboratively with all participants in the broad health care community. We are building honest, substantive and trustworthy relationships as a foundation for collaboration and shared efforts to create a better, more open and modern health care system than the one we all inherited. • We are committed to serving people. The very human nature of both the social marketplace and the health care needs we address require a much higher commitment to compassion than what is required of other commercial endeavors. Compassion must be at the center of everything we do. • We are committed to building businesses. That’s who we are — people with proven skills, deep experience and insights who serve and advocate daily for an ever better health care system. We put private capital and talented people to work to achieve that goal in a manner that is accountable to society and our shareholders. We draw upon the creative and competitive strength of the open market to support our efforts. We use private sector capital to grow and advance in sustainable and profitable ways, based on the quality and consistency of the work we do, the trust we earn and the ever-improving value we deliver to those we serve, providing a distinctive return on capital to those who invest. We believe we can play an integral, enabling role in addressing some of society’s greatest challenges in health care, today and in the future. Each year, these commitments take root more deeply into the culture and character of this enterprise. Our culture is built on commonly shared beliefs and values and brought to life in the attributes, the actions and the behaviors we honor and reward. Today, we reflect less on past accomplishments and focus more on the challenges and opportunities before us. We can make a difference. We can help people live healthier lives. We can help make the health care system work better for everyone. We can grow and advance in profitable ways to provide distinctive returns on the capital entrusted to us. And in achieving these things, we can help address some of the broader social challenges of health care that have prevailed for too long.


"
United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2012,"The employees of UnitedHealthcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group worked together in 2012 to meaningfully advance the long-term capabilities, value, performance and potential of this enterprise for sustained growth. This letter represents one of the few public opportunities to recognize their extraordinary efforts and I’m honored to do so here. Their commitment to consistent and ever-improving execution on behalf of those we serve across the diversity of our businesses truly makes a difference in people’s health and in their lives. As we move forward into 2013 and the next several years, we expect change will continue to characterize our national health care system. We remain dedicated to creating a higher quality, more consistently effective and affordable health care system to better serve the needs of all Americans. No other organizations are more capable than Optum and UnitedHealthcare at applying innovative ways to improve care quality and supporting the consistent practice of evidence-based medicine, while improving affordability through the optimal organization and use of care resources. In an environment of constant change, distinctive themes are emerging: • Consumers are taking a greater role and responsibility in health care decision-making. They need a trusted navigator to guide them through the complex health care system helping them find the right care, at the right time, in the right setting. We are becoming ever more consumer-focused, offering high levels of personalized service, dependable information, personalized tools and incentives that help individuals and families live healthier lives and make wise use of health care resources. • The roles of physicians and other health care professionals and care facilities continue to evolve. The science of care is advancing, along with increasing demands for consistency, transparency and compliance. We are committed to supporting this evolution with the most innovative yet practical technologies; insightful, reliable data and analysis; and broad access to secure patient information to help care providers make optimal and compassionate care decisions for their patients — while modernizing the administration of physicians’ practices, hospitals and clinics to help them become more sustainable resources for care. • We are committed to serving health benefit sponsors by providing innovative, flexible benefit designs that engage and incentivize consumers to embrace healthy behaviors — whether those benefits are purchased by individuals on state insurance exchanges, by small, midsized or national employers, or by state and federal programs. We will consistently exceed benefit sponsors’ expectations, enabling them to meet their benefit objectives as cost-effectively as possible, while helping provide greater access to better care. On behalf of those invested in our efforts, we will protect and thoughtfully deploy your capital to build and advance ever-improving capabilities that have durable market relevance and value. We will use those capabilities to grow in profitable ways that provide distinctive returns on the capital entrusted to us, balancing both our social and financial responsibilities. In everything we do, we value integrity, compassion, respect for individuals and relationships, innovation and accountable performance. As employees of this enterprise, we have the opportunity to focus on creating new, adaptable approaches to better health care on behalf of individuals and society as a whole. We are grateful you have allowed us to hold this position of trust. We will continue to do our utmost each day to prove worthy of your trust and the trust of the people and customers we serve.
"
United Health Group,UNH,Healthcare,2013,"As we send this annual report to you, 2013 and our many
accomplishments that year seem well in the past. Today,
health care markets in the United States remain active and
continue to evolve as new policies and regulations and
the long-standing pressures on the health care system are
meeting market realities. This is the beginning of an era of
change and adjustment in which we will need to keep the
ultimate goal clearly in all our minds — an improved health
care system where our health care resources are better
deployed and accessed . . . delivered to more Americans
at lower costs, to them and to our society.
We are seeing similar dynamics as we deepen our
engagement in countries outside the United States: the
desire by governments, payers and providers to make
more ef cient and consistent use of resources and respond
more effectively to the growing needs of their people.
The employees of UnitedHealthcare, Optum and
UnitedHealth Group have never been more engaged in
these essential efforts. Working together in 2013, they
meaningfully advanced the performance capabilities of this
enterprise and delivered real value to those we are privileged
to serve. As a consequence, our enterprise continued to
grow and diversify. The consistency of our employees’
commitment to performance and service translates into
measurable improvements that have a positive impact
on people’s health and in their lives. We thank them for
their remarkable efforts on behalf of those we serve and
those of you who invest in this enterprise.
The culture and capabilities of our enterprise are powerfully
aligned with our mission — striving for a better health care
environment that better serves at both the individual and
national level. We see more change and further challenges
continuing over the next few years as new social policies and
higher expectations for better quality and more affordable
care settle into the health care economy. We are well
deployed across the health system and participating in
many aspects of these changing market dynamics.
We expect to grow, strengthen and further diversify to
meet the changing needs of consumers, care providers and
bene ts sponsors, and continue to evolve and adapt to
the opportunities we see for the future. As we have done
throughout our history, we will bring to bear the power
of information, clinical insight and enabling technology
to increase the value we are delivering in new and more
modern ways across more vibrant and effective health care
markets, better serving more people.
What will not change will be our dedication to our mission:
to help people live healthier lives and to help make the
health system work better for everyone. We will continue
to embrace a culture of integrity, compassion, innovation,
relationships and accountable performance, all anchored
by fundamental execution disciplines and service to others.
And we remain steadfast in the  scal responsibilities and
disciplines that sustain our enterprise and provide an
appropriate return for the capital you entrust to us."
CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2000,"The year 2000 was an exceptional year for CVS by any measure. We achieved continued strong financial results, including record sales, operating profit and net earnings. We also made significant strides toward our goal of being the most customer-focused, innovative and convenient healthcare service retailer in America, with four complementary and growing healthcare businesses—CVS/pharmacy, ProCare, PharmaCare, and CVS.com—serving the needs of all our customers. Excellent Financial Performance and Shareholder Returns Net sales for the year reached a record $20.1 billion, up 13% from $17.7 billion in 1999 (on a comparable 52-week basis), while same store sales surged 11% and led the industry. Net earnings, excluding a one-time gain of $19 million related to a litigation settlement, advanced to a record $735 million, or $1.80 per share, up 18% from $1.52 per share in 1999 on a comparable 52-week basis. We continue to generate significant free cash flow, reaching $384 million in 2000, ahead of our goal and significantly higher than the $233 million we reported in 1999. This outstanding performance solidified our track record of meeting or beating Wall Street’s expectations every quarter since we became a stand-alone public company in the Fall of 1996, and has translated into excellent returns for our shareholders. For the year, CVS’ share price climbed more than 50%, compared with a 6% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a 10% decline in the S&P 500 Index. In contrast to 1999, when investors flocked to technology stocks and, more specifically, to pure-play Internet stocks, investors have now come back to companies such as CVS that offer the best of both worlds: old economy fundamentals with above average growth and new economy innovation. America’s Pharmacy Leader The drugstore industry remains extremely vibrant, possessing perhaps the most compelling growth demographics in all of retail—and CVS is America’s #1 Pharmacy. With 4,133 locations, we operate more drugstores than any other company in the U.S. Our pharmacy business continues to register phenomenal same store sales growth, up nearly 18% in 2000. In fact, more prescriptions are filled at CVS/pharmacy than at any other retailer. The $140 billion pharmacy industry will continue to be among the fastest-growing segments of the retail sector, driven by the introduction of new drugs and the aging American population. We continue to capture an increasing share of this expanding market. Our front-end business also continues to thrive, achieving broad-based category growth.We gained market share in all core categories, including photo, skin care, hair care, candy, cold and stomach remedies, diet/nutrition and cosmetics. Our unique photo offerings, which integrate our in-store photo processing business with digital uploads onto the Kodak Picture Center® at CVS.com, have generated excellent results. In 2000, we became the #1 online photo provider in the U.S. We are very enthusiastic about the benefits we can derive from greater customer loyalty through our new relationship marketing program, ExtraCare®. We recently rolled out our ExtraCare card chainwide and expect to create superior value for our customers, unmatched by competitors’ programs. Growing by Remaining Focused on Our Vision To achieve our objective of being the most customer-focused, innovative and convenient healthcare retailer in America, we have concentrated our efforts on building our presence in the nation’s top drugstore markets.We have added our traditional CVS/ pharmacy stores, through organic growth or strategic acquisitions, and developed new channels, such as ProCare and CVS.com, to meet the needs of all our customers. CVS currently enjoys the #1 or #2 market share in 75% of the top markets in which we operate. We have a presence in 59 of the top 100 U.S. drugstore markets, which leaves 41 of the top 100 markets for CVS’possible expansion, many of which are underserved and offer tremendous potential. During 2000, we opened or relocated 388 stores. These included new CVS and ProCare stores in current and new markets as well as relocations of existing units to more convenient sites. We also took advantage of opportunities to expand into markets that we identified as having strong fundamentals for drugstores. We recently entered the Chicago market, currently the 2nd largest drugstore market in the U.S., and we launched an aggressive expansion into several Florida markets, beginning with Tampa, the 16th largest drugstore market, and Orlando, the 27th largest. In February 2001 we announced plans to build CVS/pharmacy stores in two of the fastest-growing drugstore
markets in the U.S.—Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas, Nevada. We will announce our intentions to enter several new markets each year, but at a pace that will allow us to sustain our strong earnings growth progression. Our 1997 acquisition of Revco D.S. Inc. and our 1998 acquisition of Arbor Drugs, Inc. provided us with leadership in new markets, earnings accretion and incremental upside potential. Both companies have been fully integrated—from a systems, people and operational perspective—and are performing very well. Additionally, the businesses we acquired have become important sources of idea generation for further enhancing the performance of the entire company. CVS ProCare: #1 in a Fast-Growing Industry One of our successful new channels,CVS ProCare,has grown to become an important complement to our core CVS drugstore chain by enabling us to reach a new customer segment with specialized pharmacy needs. We introduced our first CVS ProCare apothecaries in 1999 and, during 2000, accelerated the expansion of this business through our acquisition of Stadtlander Pharmacy, a leading specialty pharmacy company, and the addition of new ProCare locations.The acquisition of Stadtlander provided CVS with the nation’s largest specialty retail/mail business. ProCare is now the #1 player in the highly fragmented, rapidly growing, $14 billion market for patients requiring complex and expensive drug therapies for longterm health conditions—and the only specialty pharmacy player with integrated retail and mail order services. We expect the addition of Stadtlander to help propel ProCare to a $2+ billion business within three to four years. Our expansion of ProCare parallels, in many respects, the growth we have achieved over the years with our PharmaCare subsidiary. Designed to meet the needs of a specific customer audience—managed care organizations—PharmaCare has become one of the top pharmacy benefit management companies (PBMs) in the nation, currently managing more than 9 million lives. Through its proprietary systems and services, PharmaCare has enabled the managed care community to provide its members with the best healthcare in the most cost-effective manner, while assuring CVS’ presence in this growing segment of the healthcare industry. CVS.com: A Winning “Clicks and Mortar” Strategy CVS.com has provided us with a new vehicle to enhance the convenience and value we offer customers…on the corner, on the phone, and on the web. Through unique partnerships with healthcare leaders, we are providing a level of healthcare information and services unmatched by our competitors, backed by the trusted CVS brand name. The strength of the “clicks and mortar” drugstore format is evidenced by the fact that approximately 70% of CVS.com’s pharmacy customers choose in-store pickup. In markets where we have CVS/pharmacy stores, more than 90% choose in-store pickup. We are continuing to drive growth in the business,and we expect CVS.com to be profitable by no later than 2002. CVS’ Strong Outlook I believe CVS is better positioned than at any time in the Company’s history to capitalize on the significant opportunities in healthcare. We are optimistic that we can achieve our targets for top-line and bottom-line growth while we continue to invest for the future. CVS is the leading player in an industry that is itself vibrant and growing. We have dynamic and expanding businesses in multiple segments of the retail healthcare industry, proven strategies in place, and a solid financial position. Our investments in new technology, such as the EPIC pharmacy system and our Assisted Inventory Management program, are expected to have a positive impact on efficiency and profitability. And, we expect to reap the benefits of our participation in the Worldwide Retail Exchange (WWRE) through better communications and streamlined ordering processes with our suppliers. CVS was a founding member of the WWRE, which has grown to encompass 53 companies representing more than $700 billion in combined retail revenue. CVS’ success in 2000 was directly attributable to the hard work and commitment of our 100,000 colleagues, and I want to thank each of them for their contributions. We also appreciate the wise counsel of our Board of Directors and the loyal support of our business partners and customers. We thank you, our shareholders, for your continued confidence in CVS, and we look forward to reporting on our future successes.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2001,"2001 will be remembered as a year of great challenge—for our country, for its citizens, and for our economy. CVS Corporation will remember the year no differently. Businesses of all sizes and across every industry faced intense challenges as we adjusted to the realities of our weakening economy. We are fortunate that our business, for the most part, is recession-resistant since we sell items that people need in their daily lives. Nevertheless, we experienced some specific areas of disappointment in 2001. We have taken action to correct the isolated pockets of problems that were within our control. Those factors not within our control—including the absence of major new drug approvals, the timing of generic introductions, and the weak economy—are likely to rebound over time. We see significant cause for optimism in 2002 and beyond. We believe the pharmacy industry has the best long-term growth dynamics in all of retail. According to IMS Health, the pharmacy industry is projected to grow at a 12 to 14% annual rate through 2005. By that time, the pharmacy industry is expected to fill one billion more prescriptions than it does today. An aging American population, the introduction of new drugs, a strong generic pipeline, and the prospect of expanding Medicare benefits all contribute to this promising outlook. With more market leadership positions than any competitor—we rank #1 or #2 in 75% of the markets we serve—we are extremely well positioned to seize such growth opportunities. Our prescription for growth includes a renewed focus on what made us so successful in the past—superior execution at the store level—by assuring our stores meet the “Triple S” of customer service. We want to be sure our customers can find everything they expect in-stock, that they can shop in a neat, well-organized store, and that they experience quick, personal, courteous service. We are positioning ourselves with cutting-edge technology and innovative marketing programs, designed to improve service to customers and keep them coming back to our stores. Our ExtraCare® Loyalty Card, launched in early 2001, already has more than 25 million cardholders, far surpassing our projections. Our EPIC (Excellence in Pharmacy Innovation and Care) solution is active now in every store, increasing pharmacy productivity and reducing customer wait times. And our Assisted Inventory Management (AIM) system, which will be rolled out in 2002, is expected to improve our in-stock position, thereby enhancing customer service. Our strong balance sheet is more cause for optimism as we enter 2002. We have the financial strength to support our aggressive growth program in the years to come. We intend to leverage that strength as we target and enter new markets. We are establishing beachhead positions in some of the fastest-growing drugstore markets in the U.S., including Tampa, Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Houston. Early results are extremely promising. We plan to continue penetrating these and other high-growth markets in 2002 and the foreseeable future. Finally, I have great confidence in our people, particularly our senior management team, which I believe is the best in the industry. They have played an integral part in our past successes. We have a strong history of growth at CVS, making swift, steady progress since becoming a public company in 1996. Then, we had annual sales of $5 billion. Today, sales are more than $22 billion. Then, we had 1,400 stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Today, we rank #1 in store count with approximately 4,200 stores in 33 states and the District of Columbia.
I am happy to report that earnings growth is projected in the range of 8-10% in 2002, and in the longer term we believe 12-15% growth is achievable. Our commitment to restore long-term, sustained, double-digit earnings growth is unwavering. To better position us for the future, we completed a comprehensive business review, which resulted in a plan to streamline operations. As a result, we will close 229 stores as well as one distribution center. We will also consolidate the operations of our pharmacy benefit management company, PharmaCare, with our specialty pharmacy business, ProCare, and close one mail facility. We took a non-recurring $353 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter related to this restructuring. The removal of these costs will contribute to a healthy financial outlook for CVS in the years ahead. While 2001 was a challenging year, our history is reassuring and our future is bright. We operate in a terrific growth industry, and we have a solid balance sheet to support our future growth. We will continue to aggressively enter new markets to fuel long-term, sustainable, double-digit earnings growth. We will also seek to enhance our cost structure to maintain our edge in superior expense control, and we will continue to invest in state-of-the-art technology to maximize our efficiency. Filling this prescription for growth requires the hard work and commitment of our 107,000 associates. We were especially proud of how they rose to the occasion in the dark hours of September 11, 2001, as our country experienced unspeakable tragedy, even offering on-theground assistance at the disaster sites. I want to thank each of them for their continued dedication. We also appreciate the wise counsel of our Board of Directors, the strong leadership of our senior management team, and the support of our business partners and customers. We thank you, our shareholders, for your support, and we look forward to reporting our future good health.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2002,"CVS Corporation has emerged from 2002 stronger, leaner and better positioned to capitalize on the rich opportunities in pharmacy. We laid out an aggressive action plan to regenerate our strong pattern of growth, and I am proud to report that we achieved what we set out to accomplish. We achieved record sales in 2002, with total sales increasing 8.7% to $24.2 billion. Same store sales increased 8.4%, with pharmacy same store sales growing 11.7%. Our earnings per share rose 12.2%, which is a greater increase than we originally projected. Despite our success, uncertainty ruled the stock market in 2002 and adversely affected our share price. Concerns about the economy, global instability, and a number of corporate scandals led to nervous investors and a bear market. We are confident that, if we deliver continued strong results, ultimately our value will be reflected in our share price. Making it Easy for Customers Our mission is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use. We know consumers are starved for time, so we are focused on making their trips to CVS as easy and efficient as possible—in a sense to help them get more life out of life. That means convenient locations, prescription renewal by phone or on CVS.com®, drive-thru pharmacy service, one-hour photo service, clipless coupons, and everything else we do to make their lives easier. It also means having items in stock that customers need. We implemented our Assisted Inventory Management (AIM) system for regular, front-store merchandise throughout the company in 2002, driving sales and enhancing customer service by improving our in-stock positions. AIM decreases our inventories per store, while at the same time helping us to have the right products in the right stores at the right times. Our pharmacy business is the next target for the AIM system. We are currently conducting a pilot test and plan to roll out the AIM system for pharmacy during 2003. Our ExtraCare card program continues to build customer loyalty. With 33 million members, ExtraCare is the largest and most successful retail loyalty program in America, and we continue to upgrade the benefits to customers. About 50% of front-store sales come through ExtraCare cardholders, representing an exceptional level of customer participation compared with many other retail programs. We remain fervent in our commitment to continually improve service to our customers. Superior customer service drives financial performance for retail companies, and we are committed to delivering extraordinary service—in all stores, every day, for every customer. Positioned for Growth We built 266 new stores in 2002, 174 brand new stores and 92 stores we relocated to superior locations. We continued our penetration into new markets that offer high growth potential, opening our first stores in Phoenix, and continuing our ongoing expansion into various Florida markets, as well as Chicago, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Houston, and Las Vegas. In fact, 78 of our new stores are located in these new market areas, positioning us right where demand is strongest. We also continue to grow market shares in many of our principal markets. We now have the #1 or #2 market share in approximately 70% of the top markets where we operate.
We are well positioned for steady, strong growth as we look into 2003 and beyond. We are a leader in the pharmacy industry, which boasts some of the best growth trends in all of retail. While drug approvals have been somewhat slower over the past two years, there is a bulging pipeline of new drugs awaiting approval. In addition, a large number of branded drugs are converting to generics, which lowers healthcare costs while improving our profitability. Congress continues to debate how to provide prescription drug coverage for those people covered by Medicare, and more Americans are entering their senior years, when their prescription drug consumption is higher. Prescription drugs are recognized as the most cost-effective means of improving healthcare, and coverage for all Americans is good for our citizens and our business. Healthy Financial Position As we enter 2003, our 40th anniversary year, we have a solid balance sheet with robust free cash flow, low debt levels, and improving inventory turns. We clearly have the wherewithal to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead. We remain committed to increasing our return on invested capital to drive shareholder value. In the 2002/2003 fiscal years, we will have invested more than $1 billion in stores and technology. We expect to open another 250-275 stores in 2003, and to grow our total square footage by 4% to 5% each year going forward. As we’ve watched companies struggle this past year with corporate governance issues, I am gratified by our company’s long-standing history of integrity, which has been one of our key values for success at CVS. We remain committed to our mission, vision and values that have made us successful for the past four decades. All of us at CVS are proud of the dedication and teamwork of our 105,000 colleagues. We are grateful for the wise counsel of our board of directors, the leadership of our talented senior management team, our strong partnerships with our suppliers, and the growing loyalty of our customers. We thank you, our shareholders, for your continued confidence. With your support we look forward to a very bright future for CVS.
"
CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2003,"CVS can look back over 2003 with a great sense of accomplishment. We turned in the best performance in our 40-year history, with sales hitting an all-time high of $26.6 billion. Our sales results improved steadily throughout the year, finishing with a record-breaking holiday season. Same-store sales grew by 5.8 percent, while diluted earnings per share rose a healthy 17.7 percent, to $2.06. Much of the credit for these results can be attributed to the success of our associates’ efforts to make CVS the easiest pharmacy for customers to use. Our research shows that customers are noticing the difference. Our pharmacy business, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of overall sales, turned in a tremendous year. Pharmacy same-store sales jumped 8.1 percent, with CVS filling more than one in every 10 U.S. retail drug prescriptions. Front-end same-store sales increased 1.2 percent. We also saw improvements in gross margins, due largely to increased generic drug sales, a significant reduction in inventory losses, and a more profitable product mix in the front of the store. These are just some of the strong underlying fundamentals that helped CVS’ share price increase 45 percent in 2003 versus a 23 percent increase for the S&P 500. Our balance sheet remained among the best in our industry, with low leverage and excellent working capital ratios. We generated a significant amount of cash and continued to put this money to use on a number of fronts—opening stores, investing in technology, and increasing our dividend payout. In fact, the 15 percent dividend hike we announced in October was the largest since we went public in 1996, reflecting our strong results and confidence in our future. Our return on invested capital increased to 9.9 percent, with the spread above our weighted average cost of capital once again demonstrating economic value creation.
We continued our successful expansion, opening 275 convenient new stores in 2003. After factoring in relocations and closings, we achieved a 3.5 percent expansion in square footage and net unit growth of 92 stores. Of these, more than 80 are located in fast-growing new CVS markets such as Florida, Texas, Chicago, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. We also broke ground for a distribution center in Ennis, Texas, scheduled to open in late 2004. The first facility of its kind in North America, it will utilize state-of-the-art storage and retrieval systems that are 30 percent more productive and require half the space of traditional distribution centers. 
Through our “CVS easy” initiatives, we’ve worked hard to make ours the easiest stores to shop among all drug retailers. Take our Pharmacy Service Initiative, which we rolled out during the year. Based on tracking studies, we have seen substantial improvements in service levels and have received overwhelmingly positive customer feedback. Our ExtraCare® program, with more than 44 million cardholders, is the largest and most successful U.S. retail loyalty program. Three years after ExtraCare’s rollout, cardholders account for a remarkable 55 percent of all transactions and are enjoying the program’s many benefits. Assisted Inventory Management (AIM), the computerized inventory tracking system we introduced in 2002, has dramatically improved our in-stock position in the front of the store. AIM helped us exceed our inventoryturn goal in 2003, making us the leader among national drugstore chains in this important productivity measure. We achieved inventory turns of 5.0 times for the year, up from 4.6 times in 2002. Furthermore, we rolled out AIM for the pharmacy in 2003 and anticipate substantial benefits as 2004 progresses. In July 2003, CVS also became the first national drug retailer to offer self-service digital photo printing. Customers have noted their approval of our easy-to-use kiosks by printing more than 25 million images through year-end. This has reversed the downward trend in the overall photo category caused by the drop in traditional overnight processing. Our “CVS easy” mission even drives the way we design our stores, with a focus on enabling customers to get what they want as conveniently as possible. They appreciate our more than 1,700 drive-thru pharmacies, carpeted floors, good lighting, and five-foot shelf heights that make it easy to find and reach every product. We’ve expanded store hours as well, with 1,600 stores—double last year’s level—now offering 24- or extended-hour service. This strategy is paying off. CVS boasts the highest sales per retail square foot of any national drugstore chain, hitting more than $800 in 2003. More than 50 percent of our stores were freestanding at the end of 2003, and we expect that figure to reach 70–80 percent over the long term. On the pages that follow this letter, I invite you to witness “CVS easy” in action.
We’ve distinguished ourselves in other ways as well. For example, CVS offers a unique front-end focus on 
cosmetics, health, and beauty. We carry France’s Avène® and Vichy® beauty care lines and are currently the exclusive U.S. distributor of Finland’s Lumene® brand. It’s worth noting that 40 percent of our Lumene customers are new to the skin care category at CVS, a clear indicator that such offerings help drive front-ofstore sales growth. In addition, customers value the way we tailor our stores with merchandise targeted to ethnic preferences and the other needs of distinct neighborhoods. Our web site, CVS.com, offers the ability to order unique products online. With our PharmaCare® subsidiary, which celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2004, we’ve built one of the most comprehensive U.S. pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and specialty pharmacy companies. The fourth-largest PBM overall with 15 million members, PharmaCare is recognized as the leader in offering a fullservice solution for small and mid-sized clients. Its 17 percent jump in revenue in 2003 pushed PharmaCare’s annual sales past $1.3 billion. I’m happy to note that PharmaCare also continues to benefit from enhanced sales and marketing efforts following the integration of ProCare, our specialty pharmacy division. CVS also tries to make it easy for doctors to maximize their time spent with patients. We are a charter member of SureScripts, an organization formed to provide an electronic link between doctors and pharmacies. This should help make the prescription-filling process faster and more efficient, and a highly promising beta test is currently underway in Rhode Island. We expect the necessary connections to be deployed nationwide by year-end 2004, with acceptance by prescribers occurring over time.
We are committed to steady, long-term, profitable growth. As we enter 2004, I have reason to feel very 
optimistic about CVS’ prospects. For starters, we’ve built a top-notch management team that is focused on 
transforming a good retailer into a great one. Our team includes a number of individuals who have spent close
to two decades with CVS, as well as professionals who have joined us from other industries. The resulting breadth of our executive talent has made us a stronger organization, ready to seize new opportunities. Moreover, we have clarity of mission among the 110,000 associates who are putting our “CVS easy” initiatives into action every day and helping us unlock our enormous potential. It’s worth noting that length of service averages 10 years for our 4,000-plus store managers and nine years for our more than 12,000 pharmacists. Extensive experience and our Emerging Leaders development program help prepare our top talent for broader field management roles.
We fully expect sales to pass $28 billion in 2004. Some 225–250 new or relocated stores are slated to
open during the year, and total square footage should grow by approximately 4 percent again. Nearly all of the net store growth will come from increased penetration in our newer markets. After only three years, these newer markets will contribute more than $1 billion in revenue in 2004. We also plan to enter other high-growth areas such as Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Orange County, California. The retail pharmacy industry is expected to more than double to about $450 billion in annual sales by 2012. Our pharmacies stand to benefit from a strong drug discovery pipeline as well as the FDA’s accelerated approval of generic drugs. Some $50 billion in pharmaceuticals will be coming off patent over the next four years. Demographics also continue to work in our favor. The population is aging, and prescription drug therapy remains a cost-effective approach to meeting health care needs. People aged 65 and over use almost four times as many prescriptions as other individuals. According to government estimates, this portion of the population will spend $1.8 trillion on prescriptions over the next decade. The competitive threat of mail order pharmacy has been a much debated issue, with consumer resistance growing against benefit plans that force patients to order maintenance medications through the mail. We are encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive response to benefit plans that allow customers to fill their 90-day prescriptions in retail stores. Let me stress that CVS does not oppose dispensing medication through mail order. However, we are opposed to a small number of PBMs implementing plan designs that not only force patients to use mail, but also dictate that patients use their captive mail order services. At best, this practice is harmful to patients because it eliminates choice and deprives them of the opportunity to obtain personal counseling from a community pharmacist. At worst, it is unfair and anti-competitive.
In November, we watched Congress pass a long-awaited prescription drug law that goes into effect in 2006. Many of its details have yet to be worked out, and we will monitor them closely. However, we believe that this kind of legislation will ultimately be good for senior citizens, good for this country’s uninsured, and good for CVS. IMS Health predicts that a Medicare prescription benefit would add 75–100 million incremental prescriptions to the market annually
Another piece of federal legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has garnered a great deal of attention of late. Enacted to improve corporate governance standards, you may be wondering what impact it will have on
CVS. Thanks to a strong corporate governance tradition, built over our 40 years in business, CVS has had to make very few changes. In fact, we are largely formalizing and documenting already existing practices. As for our Board of Directors, it has always included talented leaders from corporate America, academia, and the non-profit world. Among them, I want to extend a special thanks to Ivan Seidenberg and Eugene Applebaum. Both men served faithfully for many years and retired following our last annual meeting. In closing, I want to thank long-standing shareholders for the continued confidence you place in our efforts. If you’re new to CVS, then you’ve become a shareholder during a most exciting period. We are a company with a long history, to be sure, but “CVS easy” and the other initiatives I’ve described above demonstrate that we are not encumbered by old ways or old ideas. The eagerness to challenge ourselves and our passion for extraordinary customer service drive everything we do. I believe that CVS has the talent, the focus, and the financial strength to create new growth opportunities for years to come. 

"
CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2004,"To Our Shareholders: The past year has been a rewarding one at CVS. While continuing to build on our solid core business, we made a significant purchase that positions us for even stronger performance in the years ahead. Our acquisition of 1,268 Eckerd stores gives us a substantial presence in the high-growth Florida and Texas markets. Moreover, the addition of Eckerd Health Services (EHS) to our PharmaCare subsidiary makes us the fourth-largest full-service pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) in the United States, significantly broadening the diversity of our client base and enhancing our competitive position. We knew that executing our organic growth strategy while integrating the Eckerd acquisition would seem to be an ambitious undertaking to many outside CVS. However, as the opening pages of this report reveal, challenges like these are really all in a day’s work for our experienced management team and CVS colleagues across the country. We know what it takes to implement “CVS easy,” improve customer satisfaction, open new stores, and drive productivity, and we aim to excel at doing all of them virtually every hour of every day in every store. Enjoying strong sales and earnings growth Before discussing our activities in more detail, let me review the good news regarding our 2004 results. Driven by the strength of our existing business and the addition of the former Eckerd assets, sales rose 15.1 percent to a record $30.59 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.20, including a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of 14.5 cents as well as a one-time, non-cash negative adjustment of 10 cents relating to a change in accounting practices for leases. The acquisition diluted per-share earnings by 16 cents, and we also had one less week included in our 2004 results compared to 2003. 
Investors have responded enthusiastically to our ongoing success and to our prospects following the acquisition. CVS stock produced a 25.5 percent total return to shareholders in 2004. That number far exceeded the returns of the S&P 500 Index, the S&P Retail Index, and the chain drug industry. Our balance sheet remains among the strongest in the industry, as evidenced by our A– debt rating from Standard & Poor’s and our A3 rating from Moody’s Investor Services. Our continued financial strength allowed us to announce a 9 percent dividend increase in the first quarter of 2005. Same-store sales grew 5.5 percent, excluding the acquired stores, with pharmacy same-store sales up 7.0 percent. Our pharmacy business continues to gain share and now has 13.5 percent of the U.S. retail pharmacy market. Meanwhile, frontend same-store sales climbed 2.3 percent. We gained significant retail share in all our key front-end categories, especially photo, cosmetics, skin care, candy, and healthcare. With CVS proprietary products such as Nuprin healthcare products, the first disposable digital camera with color preview, and other new CVS private label and exclusive brands, we continued to differentiate our offerings. Rapidly integrating our new businesses; expanding in high-growth markets I’m happy to report that the Eckerd integration is proceeding faster than any large-scale integration in our industry’s history. Thanks to the talents of our management team, their experience with prior acquisitions, and our state-of-theart technology, we’ve already put the greatest risks associated with the integration behind us. We completed the migration of all financial and store systems by Thanksgiving, less than four months after closing the deal and ahead of our end-of-year target.
We had to close only 160 former Eckerd stores in 2004, fewer than anticipated, and our infrastructure is now supporting the remaining 1,100-plus stores. We have re-merchandised every location to the CVS product mix and planogram and have significantly lowered everyday prices on over 5,000 items. More than 300 locations now look like CVS stores inside and out. We have ramped up our remodeling effort and expect to complete the entire conversion by July 2005. As we complete remodeling by market, we will hold special events to re-introduce the stores to customers. Once completed, we should be well positioned to reap the benefits of a sales turnaround. Furthermore, we see tremendous opportunities for margin improvement as we bring our operating capabilities and technology to bear. In fact, we expect the acquisition to add 15–20 cents to earnings per share in 2005 based largely on productivity gains. The addition of EHS was also a key factor in the acquisition. It gives us the unmatched combination of a PBM covering 30 million lives, the industry’s leading retail presence, and a specialty pharmacy offering. As a result, we are strategically positioned to provide all payors—patients, insurers, managed care companies, and employers alike—with a complete and flexible pharmacy solution. Our core PharmaCare business is growing, with the EHS integration progressing well as we focus on retaining clients and gaining new ones. (Read more about our PharmaCare opportunity on page 6.) Even as we were busy integrating Eckerd assets, CVS maintained a brisk pace of new store openings in 2004. We opened 225, with net unit growth of 88 stores factoring in relocations and closings. As a result, square footage grew 3.4 percent. With the acquired stores, retail square footage increased 33 percent. Virtually all our net growth took place in newer CVS markets such as Texas, Florida, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Chicago. We opened our first stores in Los Angeles and Orange County, California, as well as Minneapolis. All these markets boast faster-than-average growth among the 55 and over population, a demographic that uses three times as many prescription drugs as people under 55. Leveraging our “CVS easy” efforts As with any CVS location, the success of the converted Eckerd stores will be driven in part by our ability to make the customer shopping experience “CVS easy.” Former Eckerd customers are providing us with very positive feedback on this front. They appreciate the ease with which they get into and out of our stores, the extended hours we’ve added at 80 percent of the acquired stores, and the addition of 180 24-hour locations. As for location, the overwhelming majority of the acquired Eckerd properties were already well situated. We’ve completed our ExtraCare® rollout at the acquired stores. With more than 50 million cardholders, ExtraCare is the largest and most successful retail loyalty
program in the U.S. Now former Eckerd customers in the South are enjoying advertised discounts without the hassle of clipping coupons. They are also reaping the benefits of the ExtraBucks™ cash rewards that come with their sales receipts each quarter. These are just a few examples of “CVS easy” in action, and we continue to look for ways to further improve our customer experience. Robust pipeline and new generics to help drive future growth We are seeing a temporary slowdown in industry prescription growth, which is due to a number of factors. They include the slow pace of new drug approvals, higher co-pays and growing co-insurance arrangements, Rx to over-the-counter switches, and the growth in mandatory mail order plans. However, ours is still a growth industry. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are hard at work discovering new drugs, and $40–$50 billion worth of branded drug sales will come off patent by 2008. Generic equivalents will make these medications less expensive and more accessible to a larger population. Furthermore, prescription drugs often remain the most cost-effective form of healthcare delivery, reducing the need for hospitalization and surgery and getting people back to work sooner. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 will go into effect in January 2006, and we expect to be significant participants in delivering this new benefit through our retail stores as well as our PBM. Although we expect it to put some pressure on margins, this program should prove to be a net positive for CVS. By making prescription drugs more affordable to millions of senior citizens, this new benefit should increase their utilization. Before signing off, I want to thank the more than 145,000 colleagues who focus on our “CVS easy” mission every day they come to work. Some have been with CVS for many years. Others—like the experienced and valued former Eckerd employees—are relatively new to our company. Together their efforts made this company stronger in 2004. I also want to acknowledge the work of our talented and engaged board of directors, in particular the late Terry Lautenbach. Everyone at CVS held Terry in high regard for his keen intellect. I valued the wise counsel he gave our company and me personally during his tenure on our board, and his sudden death has been a great loss. On a happier note, Hasbro President and CEO Alfred Verrecchia joined our board in September, and we’ve quickly put the financial and operational skills of this seasoned executive to work on your behalf. With 2005 well underway, we have good reason to feel confident. Our core business is thriving and the integration of the acquired Eckerd businesses is proceeding smoothly. Our focus on new markets provides a valuable engine for growth. In unlocking the value of the former Eckerd stores, we have a great opportunity to improve their profitability and gain market share. Our retail and PBM strengths also leave us uniquely positioned in our industry. Although we
don’t have a silver bullet to address all of today’s healthcare challenges, our ability to offer flexible solutions for payors can help lead the way to improving pharmaceutical healthcare in this country. Moreover, I believe that we can help payors control costs without compromising patient care. On behalf of the entire management team, you can trust that we will continue to work hard around the clock, putting your capital to its best possible use. Thank you for investing in CVS. 
"
CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2005,"The past year will certainly be remembered as one of considerable accomplishment for our company. We swiftly and successfully completed the integration of nearly 1,100 former Eckerd stores, along with the former Eckerd Health Services, acquired in 2004. At the same time, we opened approximately 300 new or relocated stores in both existing and new markets. Throughout this activity, we never lost focus on our core business, as evidenced by our same store sales growth and market share gains. Our PharmaCare pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) also hit new heights, recording total revenue of just under $3 billion. Our company’s total sales rose 21 percent to a record $37 billion, while diluted earnings per share climbed 32 percent, to $1.45. Same store sales, which now include the 2004 acquired stores, increased 6.5 percent, with front-end same store sales up a stellar 5.5 percent and pharmacy same store sales up 7.0 percent. I’m also pleased to report that we generated more than $650 million in free cash flow, reflecting the quality of our growth. Our shares produced a 17.9 percent total return, far outdistancing the 4.9 percent return posted by the S&P 500 Index. All signs point to growth in 2006 and beyond The nation’s largest pharmacy chain by store count, we were operating 5,420 CVS/pharmacy® locations by year-end plus 51 PharmaCare specialty pharmacies. We opened many of our new stores in important growth markets such as Chicago, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Orange County, and Phoenix. All of those are newer markets entered by CVS during the past five years.
I’m happy to report that we surpassed our sales and profitability targets in all of them. We expect to open 250 to 275 new or relocated stores in 2006, adding 100 to 125 net new locations. Meanwhile, we’re delighted with the performance of the former Eckerd stores acquired in 2004. Concentrated largely in Florida and Texas, they have met or exceeded expectations on every front. All operations have been fully integrated, from marketing, distribution, and human resources to information systems and the successful combination of the acquired PBM operations under the PharmaCare banner. Yet, as far and as fast as we’ve come, it’s important to note that we believe much of the acquisition’s benefits still lie ahead of us. By employing our operational expertise and technology, we are taking advantage of a multi-year opportunity to drive top-line growth, improve margins, and reduce inventory shrinkage. Furthermore, a new distribution center similar to our Ennis, Texas, facility is set to open in Florida during the second half of 2006. Highly cost-effective, its storage and retrieval systems will be capable of servicing the same volume and number of stores as a facility twice its size. Our planned acquisition of 700 standalone Sav-on® and Osco® drugstores from Albertson’s, Inc., announced in January 2006, will further strengthen our position as America’s No. 1 retail pharmacy. Upon completion of the transaction, which is expected to occur mid-2006, we will operate approximately 6,100 stores across 42 states. Almost half the stores we are acquiring are located in Southern California, which will make us the No. 1 drugstore in that fast-growing region. Most of the rest are high-volume stores in states where we already have a presence, providing many No. 1 or No. 2 market positions. We will also acquire a distribution center in La Habra, California. The transaction is expected to be accretive to both earnings and cash flow in its first full year. Leveraging new opportunities in pharmacy CVS now fills 14 percent of all U.S. retail drug prescriptions. Generics account for well over half of all the prescriptions we fill. With several blockbuster drugs poised to lose patent protection over the next several years, the demand for generics should continue to climb. While depressing top-line growth, the increasing adoption of generic pharmaceuticals is helping drive margin gains. The Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan, launched in January 2006, should increase usage of pharmaceuticals over time by making them more affordable for seniors. Some 42 million Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for the new plan, and we’ve worked
hard to position ourselves as a key information source. More than 15,000 CVS pharmacists have undergone extensive training to help seniors navigate the variety of options available to them. We’ve formed marketing alliances with three of the nation’s leading managed care organizations: UnitedHealth Group, through its Ovations business unit, Aetna, and Humana. We’ve also hosted free educational seminars and set up Medicare Information Centers in stores across the country. As a result, we are already seeing new customers in our stores. With the industry’s leading retail presence and our PBM, we are in an excellent position to benefit from Medicare Part D. Our PharmaCare subsidiary has grown into the nation’s fourth-largest, full-service PBM since its launch in 1994. An attractive business, it has low capital requirements and high return characteristics. PharmaCare has focused from the outset on providing clients with high-quality, low-cost solutions. It has also been at the leading edge of providing an integrated PBM/specialty pharmacy offering. In addition to its significant mail order pharmacy business, PharmaCare operates specialty stores across the country as well as a state-of-the-art specialty mail order facility. During 2005, PharmaCare announced a strategic alliance with Universal American Financial Corp., a leading health insurance company, under which PharmaCare will provide a full array of PBM services to Universal American-sponsored Medicare prescription plans. Gaining share in all key, front-store categories CVS gained share in the front of the store in all key categories, including health, beauty, vitamins, greeting cards, and general merchandise, while also increasing sales of private label products. Our ExtraCare® loyalty card has become a powerful tool, and customers tell us that they love the benefits. Impressively, they use the card for approximately 60 percent of front-store transactions. A laser focus on customer service is at the heart of our front-store strategy. Along with our loyalty program, new proprietary and exclusive products, and smarter promotions, our focus on making things “CVS easy®” for customers is driving our growth. Our customer research tells us that our service profile has strengthened. We are earning high marks for shopability, value, hours of operation, being in-stock, and overall customer service. Among our latest “CVS easy” initiatives, we’ve teamed up with MinuteClinic to offer in-store treatment for common family ailments through certified nurse practitioners and physician’s assistants. As of February 2006, approximately 50 CVS/pharmacy stores included these independently operated clinics, and we expect that number to rise as the year progresses. Early reports indicate that customers enjoy the convenience.
On the pages that follow, you can read about our growth opportunities in more detail. Before signing off, though, I want to thank our 148,000 CVS colleagues and our board of directors for their invaluable contributions. We could not have accomplished all we did without their tremendous dedication. They waged an impressive group effort around the integration of our 2004 acquisition while never losing focus on our existing business. Above and beyond their official responsibilities, CVS colleagues also took their civic responsibilities seriously. Their response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina was quick, effective, and passionate, as they tried to make life easier for the many victims. I couldn’t be more proud of the many contributions made by our team. I also want to pay tribute to my friend and mentor Stanley Goldstein, who is stepping down from our board in May 2006. Stanley, along with his late brother Sid and Ralph Hoagland, had the vision to open the first CVS store in Lowell, Massachusetts, back in 1963. During his tenure as President of CVS/pharmacy and then President of Melville Corporation, Stanley helped transform the retail landscape. After stepping down as Chairman of CVS Corporation in 1999 and right up to the present, he has continued to provide valuable perspective and sage counsel. It has been my pleasure and privilege to know Stanley and work alongside him for nearly three decades. He has left a legacy that will help guide our company well into the future. In closing, the bright opportunities before us mean that all signs point to growth for CVS. We expect to reap multi-year benefits from the turnaround of our acquired properties. Our retail pharmacies will leverage our leadership in the industry as well as the broader healthcare trends working in our favor. Furthermore, the combination of our stores and our PharmaCare PBM business offers payors a pharmacy solution unmatched by any competitor. Finally, our strong cash flow means that more CVS/pharmacy stores in more markets are on the way. Thank you for your confidence.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2006,"I’m delighted to report on another year of significant accomplishments for CVS Corporation, highlighted by record revenues and earnings, substantial free cash flow generation, and continued organic growth. In June, we acquired 700 standalone Sav-on and Osco drugstores from Albertson’s, Inc., providing immediate leadership in southern California, and we have made great progress in rapidly integrating and converting the stores to the CVS/pharmacy® brand. We also acquired MinuteClinic®, the pioneer and largest provider of retail healthcare in the United States, and have already nearly doubled the number of clinics as we execute our aggressive rollout across the nation. At year end, CVS operated 6,202 retail and specialty pharmacy stores, more than any other U.S. pharmacy retailer. Total sales for 2006 rose 18.4 percent to a record $43.8 billion. Meanwhile, net earnings per share climbed 10.3 percent to $1.4 billion, or $1.60 per diluted share. Same store sales increased 8.2 percent, rising 9.1 percent in the pharmacy and 6.2 percent in the front end. Gross margins also increased, largely due to significant generic drug introductions, increased private label penetration in the front of the store, and the use of our ExtraCare® loyalty program to focus promotional spending. CVS generated approximately $570 million in free cash flow. That has allowed us, among other things, to announce a 26 percent dividend increase for 2007. Our 176,000 CVS colleagues across the country helped us achieve these excel¬lent results. I want to thank them all for their hard work in making things “CVS easy” for our customers. Turning to our stock’s performance, the 17.6 percent total return on CVS shares in 2006 outpaced that of both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Over the past three years, our shares returned 74 percent, significantly outperforming the 28 percent and 19 percent returns of the S&P 500 and the DJIA, respectively. Successfully integrating our latest acquired stores Even with all the positive news outlined above, more good things are on the way in 2007 and beyond. We moved swiftly to integrate the Sav-on and Osco stores, completing the systems conversions in September 2006. The remodeling of the stores will be complete in March 2007. We’ve made these stores “CVS easy” by reducing shelf heights, resetting merchandise layouts, installing our hallmark CVS carpet, enhancing the lighting, and improving the signage.
Sales trends have moved in line with expectations. We expect the numbers to climb with the introduction of the CVS brand to these markets and the disruption of the store conversions behind us. As noted at the time of purchase, the Sav-on and Osco stores were operationally in better shape than the Eckerd stores we acquired from J.C. Penney in 2004. Still, we are executing against a significant opportunity to produce higher-quality sales through improvements in mer¬chandise assortment and category focus. We will also leverage the CVS ExtraCare card to encourage customer loyalty and increase sales and margins. Looking at the former Eckerd stores acquired in 2004, same store sales increased 14 percent in 2006. The front end rose 13 percent, with the pharmacy up 15 percent. This impressive performance comes on top of the strong gains we posted in 2005. Although same store sales growth for these stores will moderate going forward, they are still expected to outpace our overall results for the foreseeable future. Even as CVS completed two major acquisitions in as many years, organic square footage increased by 3.2 percent in 2006. We opened 265 stores, including 147 new locations and 118 relocations. Factoring in closings, we experienced net unit growth of 103 stores. We continued to expand in our newer, high-growth markets, including those in Florida and Texas as well as Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Phoenix. All our new stores in these markets are running at or above plan, with both the front end and pharmacy performing well. Benefiting from new opportunities in the pharmacy CVS/pharmacy stores now fill 16 percent of all U.S. retail drug prescriptions. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit and generic drug launches are among the positive industry factors contributing to our growth. Medicare Part D, rolled out in January 2006, has led to increased utilization of prescription drugs. Since enrolled seniors make the same co-payment regardless of the pharmacy they choose, many are opting for the convenience of the CVS/pharmacy located right in their neighborhoods. Despite a competitor’s rollout of a $4 program for selected generic drugs, we actually experienced a rise in net prescription transfers in from leading mass merchant retailers and continued to gain pharmacy share. Use of generic drugs continues to climb, and they now account for more than 60 percent of prescriptions filled. Although their lower prices depress revenue growth, generics are more profitable and help fuel our margin gains. They also help reduce overall healthcare costs for patients and payors. Our PharmaCare pharmacy benefits management (PBM) and specialty pharmacy business turned in an excellent performance in 2006. Revenue rose 24.6 percent to $3.7 billion while oper¬ating profit increased by 43 percent. Prescription Pathways®, PharmaCare’s Medicare Part D joint venture with Universal American Financial Corp., now administers prescription drug benefits for 460,000 seniors and Medicare-eligible individuals. That number places it among the nation’s top 10 prescription drug plans for Medicare Part D beneficiaries.
Gaining share in the front end and broadening our healthcare offerings In the front of the store, our continued focus on the health, personal care, and beauty categories drove industry-leading same store sales growth. The average front-end transaction grew to approximately $11 in 2006. Moreover, the ExtraCare loyalty program continued to increase in popularity with card use exceeding 63 percent of front-end sales. Our acquisition of MinuteClinic, completed in September, allows CVS to provide customers with convenient, cost-effective, and high-quality care for common family ailments right in our stores. The high level of patient satisfaction received to date has solidified our belief that this is the right concept for consumers, payors, and providers. We made the decision to buy MinuteClinic, already a strategic partner, because we wanted control of its brand as well as personnel decisions, hours of operation, and expansion rate. Most importantly, we saw an opportunity to benefit from additional revenues and profits. Since the acquisition, we have almost doubled the number of MinuteClinics from 83 to 155 across 19 states. Furthermore, we plan to open approximately 300 MinuteClinics in 2007 with well over 2,500 CVS/pharmacy stores slated to have MinuteClinics over the long term. Creating a company that serves payors and consumers more efficiently As this report goes to press, we are also close to a shareholder vote on our proposed merger of equals with Caremark Rx, Inc. If successful, the resulting entity, CVS/Caremark Corporation, will combine our unmatched retail footprint and PharmaCare subsidiary with Caremark’s leading PBM business. Together, we will create the nation’s premier pharmacy services provider, broadening our respective healthcare missions and positioning ourselves to drive many of the changes that will reshape our industry in the coming years. Shareholders of both companies have yet to vote on the merger, but we are optimistic about the outcome. Regardless, CVS/pharmacy and PharmaCare have proven how powerful a combined retail/PBM model can be. We will aggressively leverage these twin strengths in the future, because they will allow us to pursue new opportunities and help improve the delivery of healthcare in the United States. Consumers want convenience, choice, and to get more for their healthcare dollar. Employers and health plans want to give plan members access to a full range of integrated pharmacy services, promote better health outcomes, and control costs at the same time. Managing the significant costs of specialty pharmacy care remains a critical area of concern for employers and other plan sponsors. We are well-positioned to address this issue through end-to-end participation – from plan design to deliv¬ery of value-added pharmacy services via face-to-face interaction with customers. We can accomplish this on a broader platform through our proposed merger with Caremark or through accelerated organic growth of our retail/PBM model. We will carefully evaluate all our opportunities to ensure that we help drive the changes necessary to improve our industry.
Supporting our next phase of growth with key promotions With the retail and healthcare environments changing rapidly, we’ve made some organizational changes to help ensure continued success. Most significantly, we promoted Larry Merlo and Chris Bodine to the roles of President of CVS/pharmacy – Retail, and President of CVS Health Services, respectively. Larry is a seasoned retail pharmacy executive with more than 28 years of experience. He has spent 16 of them with CVS. Larry has consistently delivered results in every position he has held within our company while never losing sight of our most important assets – our customers and our colleagues. Chris’ retail and healthcare experience spans more than 20 years at CVS. He’s a leader who has combined the ability to drive strategy and innovation with a focus on execution and results. Larry and Chris have the values, the vision, and the passion for customer service to help lead CVS in the years ahead. At the board level, David Dorman and Richard Swift joined us as directors in 2006. David is the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Corporation, and his knowledge and experience should serve us well. Dick is the former Chairman, President and CEO of Foster Wheeler, and he has also served as Chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council. As a new member of the Audit Committee, Dick only enhances the rigorous approach to financial reporting that our board has long made a priority. After more than 12 years of dedicated service, Don Cornwell retired from the board. On behalf of CVS, I thank him for his valued contributions over the years. Don served with distinction on the board’s Management Planning and Development Committee as well as the Audit Committee. In closing, we have begun 2007 with a great deal of momentum and enthusiasm for the opportunities before us. Our core business is performing well as we work our way through the first quarter. Recent retail acquisitions have given us leading shares in high-growth markets, and we will leverage the CVS/pharmacy brand and our operational strength to drive growth. In MinuteClinic, we took an important step in broadening our healthcare offerings. Finally, our pending merger with Caremark would position us to be the low-cost provider and to offer payors, insurers, and consumers greater choice in prescription delivery and new, value-added services. We look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress, and thank you for your continued confidence.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2007,"The past year set the stage for a new chapter in our company’s history as we completed the transformational merger of CVS Corporation and Caremark Rx, Inc. We are now the largest integrated provider of prescriptions and related health services in the United States, filling or managing more than a quarter of all prescriptions in the nation. Beyond the sheer scale of our operations, CVS Caremark is positioned to improve access for patients, promote better health outcomes, and control payor costs in a way that no pharmacy retailer or PBM could do separately. Our unique model provides us with a significant opportunity to gain share and create new sources of growth going forward. It was a very successful year on a number of other fronts as well. Here are some highlights of our key accomplishments: • CVS Caremark posted record revenue and earnings, driven by solid performance in both the retail and pharmacy services segments. • We opened 275 new or relocated CVS/pharmacy stores and saw continued improvement in sales and profits in the stores we acquired from Albertson’s, Inc., in 2006, and from J.C. Penney in 2004. • Caremark Pharmacy Services signed up $2.1 billion in new business, a clear sign that payors understand the potential benefits of our combination. • We opened 316 MinuteClinics, increasing our total at yearend to 462 clinics in 25 states. That’s about four times the number operated by our nearest competitor. • We attained our goal of generating $2 billion in free cash flow, and we launched a $5 billion share repurchase program that we completed in the first quarter of 2008. • Even in the midst of all this activity, we remained keenly focused on service, execution, and expense control across the company. Total revenues rose 74.2 percent to a record $76.3 billion. In our CVS/pharmacy segment, same store sales rose 5.3 percent. Gross margins increased in both our retail and PBM businesses, due largely to significant generic drug introductions and purchasing synergies resulting from the merger. Net earnings climbed 92.6 percent to $2.6 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share. Turning to CVS Caremark’s stock performance, the 29.3 percent total return on our shares far surpassed the modest numbers posted by the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 2007. Our three-year performance is just as impressive. While the S&P 500 and the DJIA returned 21.2 percent and 23.0 percent, respectively, CVS shares returned 78.4 percent. We’re going to offer services that no other competitor can match. In the short time since completing our merger, we’ve made substantial progress in integrating our two companies. We brought PharmaCare, CVS’ legacy PBM business, under the Caremark umbrella, connected all our back-end systems, and are set to achieve more than $700 million in cost-saving synergies in 2008. That’s over 50 percent higher than our original target at the time we first announced the merger. We’ve also made important progress in developing differentiated offerings that we believe will lead to enhanced growth for our company over time. Obviously, we’re offering payors and patients all the services they would expect from a world-class PBM; however, we plan to take those services a step further. For example, let’s take the area of compliance. One of the simplest ways for a PBM to control payor costs and improve outcomes is by encouraging patients to take the medicine prescribed to them and to renew their prescriptions promptly. Any PBM has the capability to do this by contacting these patients over the telephone or by mail. However, face-to-face interaction is far more effective, and our CVS/pharmacy stores give us the unique capability to get closer to the consumer. We’re developing programs that tap into the combined 23,000 pharmacists and MinuteClinic practitioners in our locations across the country. We also intend to build upon our No. 1 position in the high-growth specialty pharmacy market, leverage our ExtraCare card and all its unique benefits among our millions of covered lives, enhance our health management programs, and increase use of MinuteClinic by our PBM clients. We’ll implement some of our initiatives relatively quickly; others will happen over time. We’re leveraging opportunities for greater profitability in the pharmacy. In both our retail and mail order pharmacies, we are benefiting from the aging population, greater utilization among seniors due to Medicare Part D, and the increasing use of generic drugs. Although their lower prices depress revenue growth and we continue to see pressure on pharmacy reimbursement rates, generics are more profitable than brand name drugs and help drive margin expansion. Moreover, CVS Caremark is now the largest purchaser of generic drugs in the United States, which enables us to drive down costs. In 2007, the company had a 63 percent generic dispensing rate at retail. With approximately $70 billion in branded drug sales coming off patent in the next five years, we expect that figure to rise to 75 percent by 2012. We should see similar gains for Caremark’s PBM business, whose generic dispensing rate is currently at 60 percent. 
Generic versions of bioengineered drugs represent another opportunity. Currently, the United States has no procedure for approving generic versions of bioengineered drugs when they come off patent. However, we expect to see Congress enact legislation at some point in the future to create a biogeneric approval process at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We will be well positioned if or when this occurs. We continue to open new stores and make the most of recent acquisitions. Despite the past year’s merger activity, we continued to execute our organic growth strategy at retail. CVS/pharmacy square footage grew by 3 percent, in line with our annual target. Of the 275 stores we opened, 139 were new locations and 136 were relocations. Factoring in closings, we enjoyed net unit growth of 95 stores. We continued to expand in our newer, high-growth areas such as Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Minneapolis. The former Eckerd® locations that we acquired in 2004 still enjoyed same store sales growth that outpaced our overall numbers. These stores are benefiting from their locations in high-growth markets – mainly Florida and Texas – and they continue to gain share from competitors as well. We’re also very pleased with the performance of the standalone Sav-on® and Osco® stores we purchased from Albertsons. This acquisition strengthened our presence in the Midwest and provided us with an immediate leadership position in Southern California, the country’s secondlargest drugstore market. In fact, our Southern California CVS/ pharmacy stores now lead the entire chain in sales. These new CVS/pharmacy stores are benefiting from an improved merchandise assortment and category focus. The introduction of the ExtraCare card is encouraging customer loyalty and helping drive an increase in sales and margins. In the front of the store, we’re seeing sales growth across our core categories, especially in beauty, personal care, general merchandise, and digital photo. CVS store brands and proprietary brands have been important drivers of gross margins. As solid as our front-end business is, it’s worth noting that it accounts for 30 percent of our retail sales compared with 70 percent for the pharmacy. The front-end percentage becomes even smaller in the context of CVS Caremark’s overall revenues. That’s why we expect any impact on CVS/pharmacy from a softer economy to be limited and manageable. After all, our average front-end purchase is a little under $12, and we don’t anticipate that consumers will buy less cough medicine, analgesics, or any of the other non-discretionary
items that make up the majority of our front-end sales. We even stand to benefit if consumers turn to our high-quality, lower-cost CVS store brand products to save money. We’re expanding MinuteClinic as part of our broader health care offerings. For many CVS/pharmacy customers, 2007 presented them with their first chance to visit one of our in-store MinuteClinics. Focused on treating a limited number of common ailments at a competitive price, it is helping us lower costs for health plans and self-insured employers. MinuteClinic has seen more than 1.5 million patients since inception, and customer response has been extremely positive. It is the only retail clinic to meet the rigorous guidelines of The Joint Commission, the nation’s chief standards-setting and accrediting body in health care. At least 25 percent of MinuteClinic patients have not previously been CVS/pharmacy customers. That represents a significant opportunity to introduce them to the “CVS easy” shopping experience and reap incremental sales gains in the pharmacy and the front end. As I mentioned earlier, we’re also working to incorporate MinuteClinic into our PBM offerings when Caremark sits down at the table with current and potential clients. Before closing, I want to take this opportunity to thank the outstanding management team we have across our retail and PBM businesses and the more than 190,000 people in our company who helped make the past year’s accomplishments possible. I’ve often said we have the best people in the industry, and they proved me right again. I deeply appreciate their dedication. I also want to acknowledge the considerable contributions Mac Crawford made at the helm of Caremark for nine years and in his subsequent role as the first chairman of the board of our combined company. Mac chose to step down in November, and I wish him a happy and healthy retirement. We shared the same vision for the future of this industry, and the core team he assembled remains the guiding force at Caremark Pharmacy Services. Former director Roger Headrick provided invaluable guidance during his 11 years on the Caremark board, and I want to thank him for his contributions as well. We really are at a pivotal moment in our history, with CVS Caremark poised to transform the delivery of pharmacy services in this country. We’ve done so much more than just combine two very successful businesses. We’ve literally created a first-of-its-kind company – one with the ability to grow faster than either of its components would have on its own. For us, that’s the real “power of one.” Thank you for your confidence.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2008,"CVS Caremark Corporation posted strong results over the past year, and we moved swiftly to capitalize on the competitive advantage created through the landmark 2007 merger of CVS and Caremark.
Today, we are the nation’s largest pharmacy health care company. With U.S. health care costs expected to reach more than $4 trillion annually over the next decade, we are beginning to deliver healthy outcomes for patients and driving down costs in ways that no other company in our industry can. Here are just a few of the year’s many accomplishments: • CVS Caremark generated record revenue and earnings, achieved industry-leading same-store sales growth, and continued to gain share across our businesses. • We introduced our Proactive Pharmacy Care offerings, which are designed to make pharmacy care more accessible and lower overall health care costs for patients and payors. • Our PBM added more than 90 new clients during our latest selling season, which will generate approximately $7 billion in revenue for us in 2009. • We completed the acquisition of Longs Drug Stores and its PBM, RxAmerica®, in October 2008 and also opened 317 new or relocated CVS/pharmacy stores. Although we are not immune to the recession, we continued to enjoy strong growth in 2008. Total revenues rose 14.6 percent to $87.5 billion. Driven in part by record operating margins, net earnings increased 21.8 percent. A number of factors fueled our margin gains, with continued growth in generic drugs leading the way. Along with our strong free cash fl ow generation, I’m happy to report that we faced virtually none of the liquidity issues that sent shockwaves across so much of the business landscape in 2008. CVS Caremark has a solid balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating, and we maintain a commercial paper program currently backed by $4 billion in committed bank facilities. As noted, the U.S. economy is defi - nitely in a recession and it will likely last throughout 2009. We’ll feel its effect to some degree, with growth in script utilization slowing industry-wide. Lower utilization, layoffs, and job loss will affect our PBM business; however, in a landscape where control of health care spending is urgently needed, our proven cost-reducing services and the cost-effective care offered through MinuteClinic should prove more valuable than ever. Our share price certainly wasn’t immune to the turmoil in the fi nancial markets during the past year, but we still outperformed the broad market averages. Our shares fell 27.7 percent in 2008, compared with the 38.5 percent decline of the S&P 500 Index and the 33.8 percent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Over the past fi ve years, on average CVS Caremark shares returned 10.4 percent annually. The S&P 500 and DJIA had negative returns of 2.2 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, over the same period. Our Proactive Pharmacy Care Offerings Are Gaining Traction with PBM Clients Looking at our PBM business, we’re very pleased with the broad-based enthusiasm among customers for the groundbreaking new products and services we have brought to market. This was refl ected in the number of sizable new contracts we won in the latest selling season. CVS Caremark is adding clients across the PBM spectrum – from large- and small-cap companies to government entities and private insurers. We’re achieving this by offering payors and patients everything they have come to expect from a top-rated PBM; however, we’re also offering plan design options and services that no standalone PBM can match. Through the Proactive Pharmacy Care offerings we began rolling out in 2008, we’re giving consumers easier access to their medications and to the counseling they need, whether it is through one of our mail pharmacies or at one of our more than 6,900 stores. By helping patients adhere to their drug therapies, we’re lowering overall health care costs and improving outcomes. You can read about specifi c Proactive Pharmacy Care offerings, such as Maintenance Choice and integrated specialty, elsewhere in this report. Let me note, though, how pleased we are that over 200 clients have already committed to offering Maintenance Choice to their more than 2 million covered lives. Specialty pharmacy and our Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) business are also part of our PBM segment. The past year marked our 30th anniversary in specialty pharmacy, our industry’s fastest-growing sector. In fact, specialty pharmacy accounts for approximately 20 percent of the money spent on prescription drugs in the United States even though these medications are used by only a small fraction of the population. Payors need help managing these costs and CVS Caremark is the clear category leader. Based on prescriptions we fi ll or manage, we have a 27 percent share of the $38 billion specialty market addressable by PBMs and drug retailers. Still, we currently provide specialty services to only 60 percent of our PBM customers. The ability to cross sell to the remaining 40 percent represents an important opportunity for growth. Medicare Part D continues to play a key role in ensuring that seniors can afford the prescriptions they need. We’re a major factor in this arena through our SilverScript® and RxAmerica proprietary PDP plan offerings and as a provider of PBM services to these plans and to PDPs sponsored by others. Through our PDPs and related PBM activities, we expect to cover approximately 1.5 million lives in 2009.
We’re Moving Quickly to Integrate Longs Drug Stores and Improve Their Performance In our retail business, I’m delighted to welcome over 20,000 Longs’ colleagues to our company. The Longs acquisition has given us a high-quality network of more than 500 drugstores – primarily in Central and Northern California and Hawaii – as well as Longs’ RxAmerica PBM. Commercial real estate values in California and Hawaii are among the highest in the country, and it would have taken at least a decade to assemble the prime locations we acquired had we instead opted exclusively for organic growth in these markets. We had only a modest presence in Central and Northern California and none in Hawaii. By acquiring Longs, we have become the leader in both markets virtually overnight. In fact, we now have over 800 stores in California, more than any other drugstore chain. We’ve also begun to integrate RxAmerica – and its 8 million plan participants – with our PBM business. More importantly, our greater presence on the West Coast and in Hawaii plays an important strategic role for our PBM as it pursues new contracts. We can extend our Proactive Pharmacy Care offerings to plan sponsors with active or retired employees living in these markets. I’ve often said that we don’t acquire stores for growth. Rather, we acquire stores that we can grow. The Longs deal is no exception. Our existing stores outperform the Longs locations signifi cantly in sales per square foot, gross margins, and other important measures. We intend to leverage our systems, our focus on private label and exclusive brands, our category mix, and the ExtraCare loyalty card to turn good stores into great ones. We recognize that the recession is impacting the California economy, and it may take us a while to accomplish this. When the economy rebounds, though, we will have outstanding, well-run assets in place. We’ve had a lot of experience in making the most of the opportunities inherent in our acquisitions. Just take a look at the stores we acquired from JCPenney in 2004 and from Albertsons in 2006. We’ve been able to increase their sales per square foot considerably and have realized healthy margin gains as well. Moreover, we still see signifi cant opportunities to improve the profi tability of both acquisitions. We Led the Industry in Same-Store Sales Growth In Both the Pharmacy and Front of the Store Even as we completed the Longs acquisition, we continued to execute our organic growth strategy at retail. Retail square footage increased by 3.6 percent, in line with our annual target. We opened a total of 317 new or relocated stores. Factoring in closings, organic net unit growth increased by 150 stores. Our CVS/pharmacy-Retail business had an outstanding year, with samestore sales rising an industry-leading 4.5 percent. Pharmacy same-store sales increased by 4.8 percent, even with the adoption of new generics. We’re gratifi ed by early consumer response to the Health Savings Pass for prescription drugs we introduced in November for the uninsured and underinsured. Given the current state of the economy, this is one of the ways in which we can help make health care more affordable for the general public. We are also in the process of rolling out our new pharmacy system, RxConnect™, which will reengineer the way pharmacists communicate and fi ll prescriptions.
Same-store sales in the front of the store increased by 3.6 percent, and we gained share in 85 percent of our front-store categories. Since nondiscretionary items account for the majority of front-end sales, that part of our business should prove relatively recession-resistant. And given the state of the economy, customers have been more willing to try our private-label and proprietary products. Sales of privatelabel and CVS-exclusive brands rose faster than in prior years to more than 16 percent of our front-end total at year-end. Much like generics in the pharmacy, these offerings also yield greater margins. MinuteClinic’s Expanded Offerings Bolster Our Health Care Strategy As part of our broader health care strategy, we’ve continued to open MinuteClinic locations and expand their range of services. They now include wellness and prevention screenings, and a larger selection of vaccinations. We also launched pilot programs to incorporate MinuteClinic into our PBM offerings. For example, some of our PBM plan participants can now stop in for health assessments at convenient locations. We’ve noted since MinuteClinic’s acquisition that its competitive price can help us lower costs for health plans and self-insured employers. They have begun to embrace this model, and we’ve been able to contract with more payors as a result. In fact, visits paid for by third parties amounted to more than 70 percent of our total in 2008. Our expanded health care focus can also be seen in the appointment of Troyen Brennan, M.D., in November 2008 to the newly created role of chief medical offi cer. Dr. Brennan, a practicing physician, former hospital administrator and, most recently, chief medical offi cer at Aetna, has assumed responsibility for MinuteClinic, Accordant Health Care, clinical and medical affairs, and our health care strategy. Broad Industry Trends Will Contribute to Our Long-Term Performance With strong execution across our businesses, we have good reason to feel optimistic about the future. We expect a number of long-term industry trends to work in our favor as well, including rising use of generic drugs and the aging of the U.S. population. Well over 60 percent of all drugs dispensed in 2008 across our industry were generics. That fi gure is likely to rise to 75 percent by 2012 as several blockbuster drugs lose patent protection. Looking at the U.S. population, approximately 38 million people are 65 or older today. That number is projected to climb to 47 million by 2015, and prescription drug use is expected to rise substantially within this demographic. With leading market positions in California, Florida, and other sun-belt states, we stand to benefi t from this trend to a greater extent than most other pharmacy players. Other changes are likely to unfold in the coming years that should benefi t CVS Caremark, patients, and payors alike. Among them, the Obama administration has already begun exploring ways in which health insurance can be broadened to cover a larger portion of the population. The resulting increase in access to prescription drugs would be good for CVS Caremark and good for the country. Legislation paving the way for a biogeneric approval process as well as growth in e-prescribing is also on the horizon. We look forward to working with the new administration on health care reform. On behalf of the board of directors and CVS Caremark’s 215,000 colleagues across the country, thank you for your confi dence in our company and our vision. We are just beginning to realize the benefi ts of our broader pharmacy health care mission.

"
CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2009,"Health care delivery in the United States is slowly evolving to a new model, and we believe that companies best positioned to promote better outcomes and lower costs will be among the winners. That thinking guided the 2007 merger of CVS and Caremark. Today we’re the largest pharmacy health care company in the United States, and our strengths across the spectrum of pharmacy care are helping us deliver savings and improve the plan member experience for PBM clients. I’ll have more to say about the success of our differentiated approach as well as the core strengths of our PBM and retail businesses. First, let me provide a quick review of our solid financial performance in 2009. In the midst of a challenging economic environment, CVS Caremark reported record revenue and earnings. Total revenue rose 13 percent to $98.7 billion, with income from continuing operations up 11 percent to $3.7 billion. We generated approximately $3 billion in free cash flow, deploying part of it to complete a $2 billion share repurchase program. Furthermore, the board of directors authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase program, which we began in 2009 and intend to complete in the first half of 2010. Our strong free cash flow also allowed us to raise the dividend by 15 percent for 2010. This marks our seventh consecutive annual dividend increase. Over this period, our dividend has risen at an 18 percent compound annual growth rate. CVS Caremark shares produced a total return of 13 percent for 2009, although we trailed the broad market averages due largely to some concerns over our PBM’s near-term growth outlook. However, over the past five years, CVS Caremark delivered a total return to shareholders of 48 percent, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 2 percent and 10 percent, respectively, over the same period. OUR INTEGRATED MODEL BUILDS ON EXISTING PBM STRENGTHS Building on Caremark’s long-standing reputation for customer service, clinical excellence, and an ability to control payor costs, our integrated approach to pharmacy care is yielding substantial benefits. Our more than 26,000 pharmacists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants drive our efforts every day. Based on internal surveys, colleague engagement stands at an all-time high. Their commitment is clearly reflected in our outstanding performance across a number of measures. I’m pleased to report that we have done an outstanding job of controlling costs for our PBM clients. We’ve done this by driving generic utilization through unique plan designs, by controlling specialty pharmacy trend through our specialty guideline management programs, and by improving adherence to prescribed medications through our multiple points of contact with plan members. For many people, a face-to-face interaction with their pharmacist results in a significantly higher adherence rate. We have a broad research effort underway to learn more about why patients do not take prescriptions that are prescribed or drop medications in the middle of therapy. The research includes continuing internal analysis of CVS Caremark client utilization and an external partnership with Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Separately, a recent study by the New England Healthcare 
Institute found that not taking medications as prescribed leads to poorer health, more frequent hospitalization, a higher risk of death, and as much as $290 billion annually in increased medical costs across the U.S. health care system. As the health care debate continues, one thing is clear: We all have to find ways to make health care more affordable. CVS Caremark is focusing on adherence to impact the health of our customers and help take costs out of the health care system. In 2010, we expect adherence rates to be further enhanced when our Consumer Engagement Engine (CEE) goes live across our major channels during the second half of the year. Powered by clinical rules, the CEE will identify opportunities to promote better health outcomes and to achieve costs savings across our unparalleled points of contact. The marketplace has enthusiastically embraced our innovative Maintenance Choice® offering, which gives eligible plan members access to 90-day mail pricing whether they receive their prescriptions through the mail or choose to pick them up at one of our approximately 7,000 conveniently located retail locations. This offering eliminates the plan member disruption that many payors face when they consider mandatory mail programs for cost savings. Furthermore, clients that switched from a voluntary mail program to Maintenance Choice saw their generic dispensing rates (GDR) improve and achieved savings of up to 6 percent of their pharmacy costs. We currently serve 2,200 PBM clients, and more than 480 have signed up for Maintenance Choice to date. That leaves significant upside as more existing and prospective clients begin to appreciate its benefits. WE ANTICIPATE HIGHER RETENTION LEVELS AND MORE NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR 2011 Obviously, we’ve faced some headwinds as well in our PBM business. We won $11 billion dollars in new PBM revenues over the past two years, but we also lost a similar amount of existing business over this same time-frame as a result of some unique circumstances affecting a handful of accounts. Client renewals for 2011 are looking strong, though, and I’m confident that retention will return to Caremark’s historically high levels. On the new business front, we took steps to reposition our sales message to focus first on our industry-leading PBM capabilities. We’re talking to clients about how we are able to lower their costs and improve the plan member experience. That is resonating well during the 2011 selling season, and there are a significant number of large prospects out to bid. With Howard McLure’s retirement, I’m delighted that we were able to hire Per Lofberg as our new PBM president. Per, who joined us in January 2010, brings more than 30 years of experience in the health care and PBM industries. Formerly chairman of Merck-Medco Managed Care LLC, which later became Medco Health Solutions, he
most recently served as president and CEO of our strategic partner, Generation Health, Inc. Per is widely respected in the industry, and his expertise, along with his demonstrated ability to execute growth strategies, makes him the perfect person to guide our PBM in this evolving health care environment. OUR SAME-STORE SALES GROWTH LEADS ALL PHARMACY RETAILERS Despite the recession, our retail stores put up outstanding numbers. Same-store sales rose 5.0 percent, while pharmacy same-store sales increased 6.9 percent. These results led our industry throughout 2009, and we gained significant market share. Organic growth continued apace as we opened 287 new or relocated stores. Factoring in closings, net unit growth was 102 stores. Today, approximately 75 percent of the U.S. population lives within three miles of a CVS store. Our stores fill nearly one in five prescriptions nationwide, and we have the #1 or #2 market share in 14 of the top 15 U.S. drugstore markets. Our industry-leading customer service and the use of advanced technology, combined with the increasing adoption of Maintenance Choice by PBM clients, all contributed to our pharmacy growth. In the front of the store, we gained share in 82 percent of our core categories. Moreover, sales of private-label and CVS-exclusive brands rose faster than they have historically to account for nearly 17 percent of our front-end total. These lower-cost products offer excellent value, which clearly appealed to cost-conscious consumers in the midst of a recession. We, in turn, benefited from the higher margins these products provide compared with national brands. Our private-label program is ambitious, and we added more than 900 offerings to our shelves during the year. The Longs Drugs® stores we acquired in October 2008 were integrated on schedule and are on track to be accretive to earnings in 2010. Profitability is already on the rise as we’ve begun to leverage our systems, our focus on private label, our category mix, and the ExtraCare® card. We have a solid track record at making the most of our acquisitions, roughly doubling the profitability of the drugstores we acquired from JCPenney in 2004 and from Albertsons in 2006. EXTRACARE AND OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS HAVE HELPED DRIVE PROFITABILITY We can trace our industry-leading performance in no small part to the many investments we have made over the past decade in technology, in enhancing the layout and “shopability” of our stores, and in driving customer loyalty. The ExtraCare loyalty program, which we rolled out in 2001, is today the most popular among all retailers. More than 64 million active cardholders take advantage of sales in the store and at CVS.com, and they received $1.9 billion in ExtraCare savings and Extra Bucks rewards throughout 2009. ExtraCare represents a significant competitive advantage for us, and CVS Caremark has a huge head start over any drug retailer contemplating its own loyalty program. More recent investments position CVS Caremark for greater profitability in the coming years. For example, our proprietary RxConnect™ computer system, whose rollout will be completed during 2010, should improve both efficiency and customer service in our pharmacies. We’ve also opened call centers that allow us to redirect much of the telephone call volume from our busiest stores. That frees up retail pharmacists to spend more time counseling patients face-to-face. WE’VE EXPANDED MINUTECLINIC’S OFFERINGS AND FORGED NEW ALLIANCES At MinuteClinic, our retail-based health clinics, we expanded the services offered, further integrated MinuteClinic into our PBM offerings, and forged a number of strategic alliances with highly regarded health care providers such as Humana, Inc., and the Cleveland Clinic. Today we have approximately 570 clinics in 56 markets across the country.
In 2010, a key focus will be adding protocol-driven monitoring services for common chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. That will be done in coordination with a patient’s treating physician and is designed to improve adherence and outcomes. We also expect to offer additional acute care services and improved point of service lab tests. Under its new president, Andrew Sussman, M.D., this business is moving in the right direction. CVS CAREMARK WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM NEW PRODUCTS AND BROAD INDUSTRY TRENDS Looking ahead, we will continue to offer new and innovative services that help attract and retain PBM and retail customers. For example, we plan to expand pharmacogenomic clinical and testing services for CVS Caremark PBM clients through our ownership stake in Generation Health. We want to improve care for patients who are either non-responsive to their medications or who experience adverse reactions as a result of their genomic makeup. We expect to begin offering these services during 2010. We are currently in the process of transitioning our iScribe® clients to Allscripts, the largest provider of e-prescribing and electronic health record solutions. E-prescribing can significantly reduce medication errors. With this partnership, we hope to accelerate the adoption of e-perscribing across our client base. Broad industry trends will work in our favor as well, from potential health care reform and an aging population to new blockbuster and generic drug introductions. CVS Caremark has been participating in the national debate over legislation to reform the U.S. health care system. We believe the right combination of reform and expansion will be good for the nation. As the largest provider of cost-effective pharmacy care in this country, we stand ready to support this effort. Looking at demographics, the number of people in the United States who are 65 or older will jump to roughly 47 million by 2015 and to 55 million by 2020. This age group fills an average of more than 25 prescriptions per person annually – 30 percent more than people between the ages of 55 and 64. That will increase utilization dramatically for years to come and will help drive the growth of both our PBM and retail businesses. Of course, the opportunity in generics is enormous. Nearly $100 billion in branded drug sales will lose patent protection over the next six years. As a result, our GDR could eventually approach 80 percent. That is expected to further reduce costs for health plans, plan sponsors, and their members while expanding our pharmacy margins. We are also hopeful that Congress will pass legislation that finally paves the way for a biogeneric approval process. As you can see, we’re very optimistic about our prospects, both in the short-term and long-term. Pharmacy health care in this country has a bright future, and we believe our combined assets will lead to a bright future for our company for years to come. On behalf of our board of directors and our 211,000 colleagues across the country, thank you for investing in CVS Caremark.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2010,"U.S. health care costs are expected to rise 6 percent annually over the next decade, pushing the total spent in the United States to around $5 trillion in 2020. The alarming growth of chronic disease in an aging U.S. population will drive much of this increase, and companies that can find a way to help employers, insurers, and plan members rein in the related costs are poised to benefit.
At CVS Caremark, we see a significant opportunity to reduce the nearly $300 billion that is spent annually as a result of non-adherence to prescribed medications and other forms of sub-optimal pharmacy care. As the nation’s largest pharmacy health care provider, we can accomplish this through our differentiated PBM offerings, our leadership in clinical programs and specialty pharmacy, our unmatched retail footprint, and our growing base of MinuteClinic locations. Our strategy is to utilize these elements of our integrated pharmacy services model to lower health care costs while improving the health of those we serve. It’s important to remember that pharmacy care remains one of the most cost-effective ways of treating disease, so we are well-positioned to slow the rise in health care costs even as we encourage appropriate utilization of prescription drugs. We’ll have more to say on this topic and the state of our business in general. Let’s start, though, with a quick overview of the past year’s performance. Our 2010 Financial Performance and Commitment to Enhancing Shareholder Value 2010 marked a year of substantial progress for our company despite continued challenges in the broader economy. We successfully navigated through a challenging retail and consumer environment, delivering industry-leading same-store sales growth, solid expense control, and significantly 
improved retail operating margins. However, we faced some well-documented challenges in our PBM business, and we are disappointed with our performance. Total revenue decreased 2.3 percent to $96.4 billion, with income from continuing operations down 7.2 percent to $3.4 billion. We will talk more about the steps we are taking to turn around PBM performance. CVS Caremark shares returned 7.9 percent in 2010, trailing the 12.8 percent return of the S&P 500 Index. Our below-market share performance is unacceptable, and enhancing shareholder returns remains a top priority for us. Accordingly, we returned more than $1.9 billion to our shareholders last year through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We were able to accomplish this as a result of the $3.3 billion in free cash flow we generated in 2010, a 7.6 percent increase over 2009. We expect our cash-generation capabilities to increase substantially in the coming years due to anticipated earnings growth and a sweeping initiative to reduce working capital. We will take a disciplined approach to deploying the substantial cash we generate to achieve the highest possible return for our shareholders. We will invest in high-return projects and expect to continue returning value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. To that end, we recently raised our dividend by 43 percent, making this our eighth consecutive year with a dividend increase. We also expect to complete our $2 billion authorized share repurchase during 2011. Long-Term Agreement with Aetna Highlights Strong 2011 PBM Selling Season As we said, we have begun to take steps to turn around the performance of our PBM. After experiencing contract losses in the 2010 PBM selling season, we undertook a series of steps to stabilize and grow our PBM, and position the business for long-term success. We re-established momentum in the 2011 selling season and are very pleased with our progress to date. Our client satisfaction rate remained high and we saw a 97 percent retention rate during the season. We also added a significant amount of net new business, with revenues totaling approximately $9.4 billion. The 2012 selling season is off to a good start as well. Clients are enthusiastic about our differentiated offerings, which enjoyed positive momentum in the 2011 selling season. Maintenance Choice®, which gives plan participants the option of filling their 90-day maintenance prescriptions by mail or at one of our convenient retail locations, has been adopted by approximately 600 clients representing 7.4 million lives. Our generic step therapy programs have been adopted by 170 clients representing 5.5 million lives. Our newest addition, the Pharmacy AdvisorTM program, has already been adopted by PBM clients representing more than 10 million lives, or approximately 20 percent of our PBM book of business. The 12-year agreement we landed in July to provide Aetna with a broad range of PBM services marked a watershed for our company. The result of an extensive competitive bidding process, it provides significant validation of our core PBM capabilities as well as the benefits we bring to the table through our integrated model. Once fully implemented, CVS Caremark® will serve approximately 9 million Aetna PBM members and administer approximately $9 billion in annual drug spending. In addition to taking over management of Aetna’s retail pharmacy network as well as pharmacy customer and member service functions, CVS Caremark will also handle purchasing, inventory management, and prescription fulfillment for Aetna’s mail-order and specialty pharmacy operations. We see significant upside opportunity from this relationship over time, as we work together to offer our unique products that will help lower overall health care costs and improve health outcomes for members.
We Are Streamlining Operations and Are Strategically Positioned in High-Growth Businesses While we expect to see a decline in PBM operating profit in 2011, we are optimistic about our PBM’s long-term prospects and believe we are well-positioned to navigate the challenges and opportunities facing the industry in the coming years. Among our priorities, we have begun implementing a PBM streamlining initiative to improve our workflow and align our cost structure more closely with peers. The PBM, much like CVS on the retail side, went through significant acquisition activity over the past decade, and there are still many opportunities to build a more cohesive, efficient, and streamlined organization. This PBM initiative is expected to deliver more than $1 billion in savings between 2011 and 2015. We also have all the capabilities in place to increase our revenues and expand our market share. For example, let’s take a look at specialty pharmacy. We currently generate more than $11 billion in specialty pharmacy revenue annually, making us the largest specialty pharmacy provider in the U.S. Through our industry-leading Specialty Guideline Management program, we facilitate appropriate utilization across disease states and help clients control their specialty spending. Specialty is also the fastest-growing pharmacy sector, with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 12 percent expected over the next five years. CVS Caremark is also a very significant player in the Medicare Part D business, one of the fastest-growing areas of the PBM space. While our 2010 results reflect the negative impact from a disappointing Medicare Part D competitive bidding process for the 2010 plan year and regulatory changes that reduced our profitability, we view Medicare Part D as an integral part of our long-term strategy. A growing portion of the population will receive its prescription drug coverage under Medicare plans, driven by age demographics and the anticipated shift of retirees from employer-based coverage to Medicare. In fact, we expect the Medicare Part D market to grow 8.5 percent annually, on average, from 2010 through 2020. Our size and capabilities position us to capitalize on this opportunity, and we have a dedicated group with new leadership to focus our efforts. In anticipation of this continued growth, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Universal American’s Medicare Part D business for approximately $1.25 billion. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval, as well as approval by Universal American shareholders. Upon closing, it would more than double the size of our prescription drug plan (PDP) business to more than three million members and make us a strong #2 player in Medicare Part D. The deal is expected to close at the end of the second quarter of 2011. We expect to benefit from the addition of Universal American’s Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plan (MA-PD) insurance business beginning in 2011 and to begin servicing the PBM contracts for both the PDP and Universal American’s MA-PD business beginning in January 2012. Pharmacy Advisor Utilizes Our Retail Footprint to Improve Care and Control Costs We are very excited about the rollout of our Pharmacy Advisor program early in 2011. It will help us add value for our PBM clients and improve the health of plan members. Leveraging our retail presence—unique among major PBMs—we can offer chronically ill patients the benefit of face-to-face counseling in our pharmacies to improve their medication adherence rates and close gaps in care. Based on our research and the pilot program for diabetes patients that we completed in 2010, in-store counseling helps close gaps in care at nearly twice the rate of phone counseling alone. Using Pharmacy Advisor, a PBM client with 50,000 employees whose population has an average prevalence of diabetes could save approximately $3.3 million a year in medical expenditures.
We’ve spent the past three years developing and implementing the technology that makes Pharmacy Advisor possible. Utilizing clinical rules, our Consumer Engagement Engine identifies cost savings or health improvement opportunities for PBM plan members whether they interact with us at our retail and specialty pharmacies, through our mail order pharmacies, or using our Web sites. We’ve made diabetes intervention our initial priority. In the future, Pharmacy Advisor will also address issues related to coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other chronic illnesses. Our MinuteClinic Offerings and Footprint Will Expand to Meet Growing Demand Our 560 MinuteClinic locations represent another important aspect of our unique value proposition. Non-flu vaccination visits to MinuteClinic increased by 22 percent in 2010. We have really focused our efforts over the past year at bringing new products and services to market that help manage chronic conditions. We expect to incorporate these new capabilities into our PBM plan offerings. As we move into the care of patients with chronic disease, we have also established formal affiliations with some of the country’s leading health systems to collaborate on patient care. We expect health care reform to bring some form of coverage to 32 million people who are currently uninsured. MinuteClinic will help meet the growing demand for care and mitigate the growing shortage of primary care physicians. We will begin adding approximately 100 new clinics annually over the next five years. We will start by filling in existing markets as well as adding new markets in existing states, with plans to enter new states beginning in 2012.
Industry-Leading Performance Across Several Measures Characterizes the Year in Retail Our retail stores continued to outperform competitors and gain share in 2010, and we expect a similar outcome in 2011. We led the industry with 2.1 percent same-store sales growth; 2.9 percent in the pharmacy and 0.5 percent in the front of the store. We also outperformed all drugstore chains in sales per square foot and profitability measures. We opened 285 new or relocated stores in 2010. Factoring in closings, net units increased by 152 stores, which equates to 2.9 percent retail square footage growth. Over the next three years, we expect to add approximately 150 net new stores annually. That would increase our retail square footage growth each year by 2 to 3 percent. CVS/pharmacy® entered nine new markets over the past two years, and results have exceeded our expectations. In 2010 alone, we opened our first stores in Memphis, Omaha, St. Louis, and Puerto Rico. As we accomplished with earlier acquisitions, we have improved the performance of the Longs Drugs® stores we purchased in 2008 across several key financial metrics. By leveraging our systems, our focus on store brands, our category mix, and our ExtraCare® loyalty card, profitability in the Longs stores has improved significantly. In addition, average store prescription volumes have increased by more than 5 percent. Given the much larger retail footprint and sales mix of the acquired stores, we do not expect them to match the sales productivity of our core CVS/pharmacy locations. That said, we see significant upside and expect to close the gap further over the next several years. In the front of the store, our ambitious store brand program generated more than $3 billion in sales in 2010. Store brands now account for 17 percent of our front-end total, and we believe that penetration can reach more than 20 percent in the next two to three years. From over-the-counter drugs to grocery items, we offer more 
than 5,000 store brand items that are less expensive for shoppers and help create loyalty. They provide us with higher margins as well. Their excellent value has certainly appealed to consumers in this challenging economic environment. Moreover, many of our store brand offerings are far more than just “me too” versions of national brands. We’ve actually introduced products that either have no national-brand equivalent or offer innovative packaging that appeals to more than the just the price-sensitive shopper. We expect to add around 900 new store brand offerings in 2011. The ExtraCare loyalty program remains one of the main drivers of our industry-leading performance in the front of the store. The largest loyalty program among all U.S. retailers, it now boasts more than 67 million active cardholders. In 2010, they received $3.2 billion in ExtraCare savings and Extra Bucks® rewards. Our 10 years of experience working with ExtraCare enables us to fine tune our promotional programs and spend our advertising dollars most efficiently and effectively. It also helps us tailor our merchandise mix to best suit customers’ needs and improve productivity. We are currently developing some new customized store layouts based on our research and have already reconfigured several locations. In our “urban cluster” stores, where the front end can exceed 40 percent of sales, we have added assisted self-checkouts to improve checkout speed and expanded certain categories such as baby and grocery. We have converted more than 200 such stores to date. The early results are promising, with trips, sales, and margins all up significantly. We are in testing phase with two additional clusters and look forward to sharing more information on our results as we delve further into this opportunity for future growth. In closing, we operate in a dynamic and growing industry. Over the past few years, we have set up an infrastructure that will position the company to be very productive for years to come. We want to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their dedication and hard work. We have a sense of urgency, an engaged workforce, the right assets, and the right technology. We are extremely well-positioned to play an important role in the evolving U.S. health care market, and we are committed to driving strong growth and returns to shareholders. On behalf of our Board of Directors and our 201,000 devoted associates across the nation, thank you for your continued support
"
CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2011,"2011 was a year of great accomplishment for our company. We set challenging – yet achievable – goals and delivered on our promises. We executed successfully on a number of initiatives across the enterprise, reporting solid results in a difficult environment.
Our retail business continued to experience solid top- and bottom-line growth, and we achieved steady share gains. Our pharmacy benefit management, or PBM, business enjoyed strong revenue growth, another very successful selling season for 2012, and significant progress on a number of key initiatives. MinuteClinic® continued expansion of its footprint and services and reached breakeven profitability at the end of the year, as we expected. And our unique integrated offerings are evolving and gaining significant traction in the marketplace. As we close the chapter on 2011 and look forward to what lies ahead, we are optimistic that we can deliver even better results in 2012. The current health care landscape presents a number of challenges that we see as opportunities. Among them, overall health care costs will continue to increase, a scenario that will be intensified by an aging population. Exacerbating this problem is an insufficient focus on lower-cost solutions such as preventive care and prescription drug adherence. Consumers also are taking on greater accountability for their health care, as direct-to-consumer markets grow and employers shift more and more costs onto their employees. Moreover, the current shortage of primary care doctors, combined with a growing demand, will result in a major physician shortage. Our suite of assets is very well aligned to address and bring solutions to these issues. We’ve integrated our industry-leading PBM business, retail pharmacies, and retail health clinics with the following goals in mind: • To provide greater access, convenience, and choice to pharmacy care;
• To deliver solutions that improve the health of those we serve; and • To lower the overall cost of health care. By capitalizing on CVS Caremark’s best-in-class businesses as well as the power of our combined entity – what we call our “integration sweet spots” – we are well-positioned to deliver on our goal of reinventing pharmacy for better health ... and better shareholder value. As our strategies have advanced and taken hold in the marketplace, we are very excited about the results of our efforts. Before getting into more detail on that, I want to provide a quick overview of the past year’s performance. 2011 Saw Strong Revenue and Earnings Gains Coupled with Record Free Cash Flow Net revenues increased 11.8 percent to a record $107.1 billion in 2011, with Adjusted EPS rising 5.9 percent excluding the three-cent per share tax benefit in the prior year. CVS Caremark shares returned 18.9 percent, significantly outpacing our retail pharmacy and PBM peers as well as the broader S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average. We are extremely pleased with our performance and highly focused on further enhancing shareholder value. Our roadmap for accomplishing that consists of three main pillars: • Driving productive, long-term growth; • Generating significant levels of free cash; and • Adhering to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow in 2011, a 39 percent increase over 2010’s level. In total, we returned $3.7 billion to our shareholders last year – nearly double 2010’s total – through $3 billion in share repurchases and a 43 percent dividend increase. With our steady state earnings targets, we expect free cash flow to increase substantially over the next several years. We plan to use our available cash to invest in opportunities that will enhance our returns, to repurchase shares, and to continue to increase our dividend with a targeted payout ratio of 25 to 30 percent by 2015. Our PBM Enjoyed High Client Retention Rates with Significant New Contracts Awarded In our PBM business, our deep clinical expertise allows us to deliver a wide spectrum of best-inclass services and innovative plan designs for our clients and their members. Our specialty pharmacy is an industry leader, and our Medicare Part D prescription drug plans make us a strong No. 2 player in this fast-growing space. Our PBM business made tremendous strides over the past year. Our client retention rate for 2012 is approximately 98 percent while our book of business grew significantly. Our 2012 selling season yielded more than $7 billion in net new sales along with another $5.5 billion related to PBM contracts that came with our 2011 purchase of Universal American’s Medicare Part D business. In fact, when we combine the 2011 and 2012 selling seasons with the Universal American acquisition, we have increased our book of business by 50 percent compared with 2010. At the same time, we have been successfully executing the PBM streamlining initiative we announced last year, 
which is expected to save us more than $1 billion cumulatively through 2015. Our specialty pharmacy revenue has risen by more than 17 percent annually over the past two years and is expected to account for $15 billion in sales in 2012. We stand to benefit from this sector’s robust R&D pipeline and have numerous offerings that help PBM clients manage their specialty spending more effectively. The government is rapidly emerging as the major payor for prescription drugs in the United States. Forecasts vary, but Medicare and Medicaid could be paying for as much as two-thirds of all U.S. prescriptions by 2020, up from approximately one-third today. Our integrated business model is very well-positioned to serve these populations. We are focused on building a leadership position in the Part D business and investing in state-ofthe-art systems to handle its challenging regulatory requirements and complex benefit designs. We’re Reinventing the Role of Our Retail Pharmacists, Leading in Adherence, and Gaining Share Our focus on superior customer service, increased access, and patient care improvements continued to drive share gains in our retail pharmacies. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 3.1 percent in 2011. That pushed CVS/pharmacy’s share of the total U.S. retail prescription market to 19.5 percent, up nearly six percentage points since 2004. Much of the credit goes to the evolving role of our pharmacists, who have seen their traditional role as dispensers of medications expand greatly to focus on providing broader health care services. Today, CVS pharmacists are trained to administer vaccinations and to consult with patients on opportunities to improve adherence, close gaps in care, and lower their costs. Based on our data, CVS/pharmacy now has the highest adherence rate among top U.S. pharmacy retailers. This is critical because non-adherence – that is, not refilling prescriptions or not refilling them on time – costs the U.S. health care system an estimated $300 billion annually in avoidable health care costs. Our pharmacies also have the highest generic dispensing rate, or GDR, in our industry, which is helping PBM clients and patients save money. Although the lower prices of generic drugs can exert a drag on revenue growth, their greater margins help drive profitability. We see significant opportunities on the horizon to further increase our GDR. In 2012 alone, approximately $35 billion of branded drug sales will lose patent protection. Our ExtraCare® Loyalty Program, Clustering Initiatives, and Store Brands Remain Key Drivers of Front-Store Profitability Our front-store business also turned in another year of solid performance in a weak economy, with front-store same-store sales increasing 0.8 percent. Introduced back in 2001, our ExtraCare loyalty program provides us with a powerful competitive advantage. The largest and most successful retail loyalty program, it has more than 67 million active households and currently accounts for approximately 85 percent of our front-store sales. ExtraCare enables us to execute a targeted front-store promotional strategy and drive more profitable sales.
We also leveraged the deep customer insights gained through ExtraCare to launch our store clustering initiative in 2009. To date, we have remodeled more than 4,000 stores to tailor our merchandise mix based on the way our stores are shopped in certain locations. We have rolled out two different clusters thus far – food convenience and urban – and are seeing revenue and profitability increases in each. In 2012, we will expand our store segmentation approach by rolling out additional cluster prototypes that will enable us to customize our store fleet and meet the unique needs of each store’s customer base. The store brand category, which now accounts for approximately 17.5 percent of front-store sales, represents another growth driver in the front of our stores. These products are less expensive for shoppers, help create loyalty, and provide us with higher margins. We believe that store brands can reach 20 percent of front-store sales over the next few years, and we are adding hundreds of new products every year. Our real estate program continued on pace as we opened 247 new or relocated stores. Factoring in closings, net units increased by 145 stores. That equates to 2.6 percent retail square footage growth, consistent with the level of the past several years. MinuteClinic Has Broadened Its Scope and Forged Key Strategic Alliances We now operate approximately 600 MinuteClinics, most of which are in CVS/pharmacy stores across 25 states, with that number expected to rise to 1,000 by 2016. We believe MinuteClinic will play an important role in addressing some of the cost challenges related to health care in this country, as well as access issues resulting from the national shortage of primary care physicians. This situation will only be exacerbated when 32 million Americans obtain health insurance beginning in 2014 through health care reform. MinuteClinic has been expanding its scope of services to focus more on preventive care and monitoring for chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. We are also partnering on patient education and disease management initiatives through the formal affiliations we’ve established with some of the nation’s leading health systems. Taken together, these health systems represent more than 125 hospitals and 35,000 physicians. As part of our clinical collaboration, some of these doctors now serve as medical directors for their local MinuteClinics. We are integrating our electronic medical records with those affiliated health systems and, in the future, we expect to play a collaborative role with the Accountable Care Organizations that are an outgrowth of health care reform. The collaboration of MinuteClinic with our PBM represents just one of our integration “sweet spots,” allowing us to create programs for PBM members that are difficult for any of our competitors to match. For example, clients have the opportunity to change their benefit structure to substantially reduce or eliminate co-pays at MinuteClinic, which will encourage cost-effective member behaviors and expand access to highquality care. MinuteClinic also offers our PBM clients flu vaccination and biometric screening
programs, injection training and on-site, employerbased clinics. Clients Are Embracing Our Unique Integrated Offerings While We Continue to Expand Them Our integrated offerings leverage the clinical expertise and insights from our PBM business along with the broad reach and face-to-face engagement in our retail business to deliver innovative solutions that are unmatched in the marketplace today. These solutions enhance access, lower health care costs, and improve health outcomes, and we have compelling data proving the efficacy of our unique programs. Among our integrated offerings, we have seen an enthusiastic response to our Pharmacy Advisor® program, which had more than 12 million lives enrolled at the end of 2011 after just one year of being broadly available. That represents approximately 20 percent of our PBM book of business. Capitalizing on our retail presence – unique among major PBMs – we can offer chronically ill patients the benefit of face-to-face counseling in our pharmacies to improve their medication adherence rates and close gaps in care. We are particularly encouraged that many new customers have opted to implement Maintenance Choice®. This program gives qualifying plan participants the option of filling their 90-day maintenance prescriptions by mail or at one of our convenient retail locations at the same co-pay and payor pricing as mail order, something that is very difficult for a standalone PBM or retailer to offer. Clients representing more than 10 million members adopted Maintenance Choice as of January 2012. Our new enhancements to this offering, which we have dubbed Maintenance Choice 2.0, have the potential to more than triple the number of members participating in Maintenance Choice by making it more broadly available to the PBM book of business and also making it easier for consumers to use. You can read about Pharmacy Advisor and Maintenance Choice in more detail on pages 10-13. In closing, I must extend my thanks to our 200,000 colleagues who are the collective face of CVS Caremark. Their dedication and commitment to our clients, customers, and communities continues to play an integral role in the success of our company.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2012,"Health care delivery in the United States is going through a period of rapid change. This is being driven primarily by the ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, along with an aging population, a growing shortage of primary care physicians, rising prevalence of chronic disease, and shifts in consumer and patient behavior. Some 30 million Americans are expected to gain health care coverage in the coming years as a result of the new legislation and demographic shifts. Despite health reform legislation, health care costs are projected to continue to rise at an unsustainable pace, putting the nation’s long-term fiscal health at risk. We are well-positioned to thrive in this changing environment and to achieve our purpose of helping people on their path to better health. We are a pharmacy innovation company, and with our unmatched breadth of assets we are bringing innovative solutions to the marketplace. These solutions enhance access to care, lower costs, and improve health outcomes – and they are sought after by providers, payors, and patients alike. Our PBM is a leader in clinical and specialty pharmacy programs and has strong positions in the growing Medicare Part D and Managed Medicaid markets. Our retail presence – 7,400 stores and counting – allows us to engage directly with five million customers daily. In addition, MinuteClinic®, the nation’s largest retail medical clinic system, continues to enter new markets, expand services, and increase its growing number of affiliations with leading health care systems. Our unmatched business model enables us to offer products and services that are difficult for our standalone competitors to replicate. For example, we have developed solutions such as Pharmacy Advisor® to address gaps in care and medication non-adherence that no other pharmacy company presently offers. Our capabilities in this area are critical because patients who do not adhere to their prescription drug regimens cost the U.S. health care system an estimated $300 billion annually in avoidable health care costs. Before I expand on these and other topics, I want to provide a brief overview of our 2012 results. By virtually any measure, the past year was an outstanding one for CVS Caremark. Solid growth and significant free cash flow are driving shareholder value Net revenues increased 15 percent to a record $123 billion in 2012. Excluding the loss on early extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 22.8 percent to $3.43. We achieved solid growth in our core pharmacy services and retail businesses, and our stores captured a significant share of Express Scripts members during its impasse with Walgreens. We also controlled expenses and increased productivity across the enterprise. Our shares performed well, returning 20.3 percent for the year. That surpassed the total returns of both the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average over the same period. In fact, we outperformed these broader indices on a three- and five-year basis as well. We remain focused on enhancing shareholder value by driving productive, long-term growth, generating significant cash flow, and optimizing capital deployment. In 2012, free cash flow totaled $5.2 billion and we returned more than $5.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend by 30 percent in 2012, and we recently announced another 38 percent increase for 2013. This most recent increase allows us to meet the low end of our 25 to 30 percent dividend payout ratio target two years early and marks our 10th consecutive year of dividend increases. With our strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, we also were able to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment to refinance a portion of our long-term debt. Our enhanced debt structure will help improve earnings and further enhance our free cash flow in future years. Our PBM won business across customer segments and is well-positioned in major growth areas Our integrated model has been embraced by the marketplace and now represents a sustainable competitive advantage in the industry. Clients recognize that our differentiated PBM offerings such as Pharmacy Advisor and Maintenance Choice® can make a real difference in enhancing access, lowering health care costs, and improving health outcomes.
We’ve grown our PBM book of business by approximately 50 percent since 2010, delivering $24 billion of net new business over this period. In the 2013 selling season, we retained 96 percent of our book of business. We also won well over $4 billion in gross new business and approximately $400 million in net new business. It’s worth noting that these gains came across customer segments, including employers, commercial health plans, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid. Medicare has quickly emerged as a major payor for prescription drugs in the United States, and our PBM is currently a strong number three player in the Part D market with roughly 6.5 million lives. This includes the lives we serve through our SilverScript prescription drug plans, as well as other lives where we serve as the PBM for health plan clients. With baby boomers turning 65 at the rate of 10,000 people per day, along with their growing utilization of prescription medications, we see the Medicare market as an attractive growth area. Managed Medicaid represents another critical growth segment for us, as health care reform could add up to 15 million new lives to Medicaid rolls in the coming years. We are currently the clear leader in the Managed Medicaid PBM market with an estimated 31 percent share. We have continued to win new clients and have also seen existing clients expand membership as states move from a fee-for-service model. Our success is due in part to our ability to tailor our programs and operations to support the unique needs of this segment. Our specialty pharmacy business continues to grow rapidly, with enterprise-wide specialty revenues of more than $18 billion in 2012. The specialty market is expected to grow to approximately $120 billion in 2016, roughly double the size of the market in 2010. That means that by late 2016, it could account for roughly one-third of total pharmacy spend in the United States. This rapid increase in specialty drug costs presents challenges for our clients, so we have expanded our capabilities to manage specialty trend across the entire continuum of pharmacy and medical benefits. When implementing our programs, which include Specialty Guideline Management, exclusive pharmacy networks, and site of care management, clients can save up to 12 to 16 percent on their specialty spend. There is plenty of other good news coming out of our PBM, from our collaboration with Aetna to our streamlining initiative. The latter, which involves rationalizing our mail order pharmacies, streamlining operations, and consolidating our claims adjudication systems, is on track to deliver $1 billion in cumulative cost savings over the five-year period ending in 2015. CVS/pharmacy® gained share and outperformed competitors on key metrics Our retail business continued to fire on all cylinders in 2012, and we gained market share in both the pharmacy and the front of the store. In fact, our retail share of the prescription drug market has grown two percentage points in the past two years to reach more than 21 percent. We also far outpaced our peer group with 9.1 percent growth in prescriptions dispensed. Even factoring out the prescriptions gained during the Express ScriptsWalgreens impasse, our underlying pharmacy growth led the industry. Our focus on excellence in patient care is a key driver of our strong performance in the pharmacy. As part of our patient care initiatives, our pharmacy teams performed 72 million customer interventions in 2012. Interventions like these keep our adherence rates well above all other pharmacy retailers, helping our patients stay healthy and driving savings for payors. Another way in which we can control health care costs is by moving patients to lower-cost, generic drug alternatives when available and clinically appropriate. Given that generics produce greater profits for us than branded drugs, we can improve profitability even as we lower costs for patients and payors. The opportunity for us in this area remains significant for the next few years.
The ExtraCare® loyalty program and our store brands continued to drive front store gains In the front of the store, our 3.4 percent rise in same store sales led the industry in 2012. We continue to use our ExtraCare loyalty program to help deliver a more personalized experience to each customer. We have been building, refining, and perfecting this industry-leading program for 15 years. Today, we have 70 million active cardholders who accounted for 84 percent of front-store sales during the past year. We leverage the insights gained from card use to support each of these customers with promotions targeted to their specific tastes and needs. We’ll be taking our efforts to the next level in the coming year by, among other things, personalizing the digital circular customers see when logging onto the ExtraCare page at CVS.com® and by offering incentives that encourage customers to shop categories that are new to them. The insights gleaned from ExtraCare also helped provide a foundation for the myCVS clustering initiative currently underway. In brief, we’ve begun to tailor our merchandise mix and remodel store layouts to match the needs of customers within certain trade areas. For example, we began rolling out what we call our “urban cluster” in 2011. Designed as a general store for dense trade areas, this concept increases our consumable offerings and also features faster checkouts. We had 450 of these stores in place at the end of 2012, and they saw notable sales and margin gains. In 2013, we expect to convert another 85 stores to the urban format. Building upon the success we’ve experienced with these urban cluster stores, we’re currently experimenting with other clusters to better tailor our stores to match our customer base. Our store brands represent another opportunity to enhance customer value while increasing profitability. These products are sold under a variety of proprietary labels such as Gold EmblemTM and Just the BasicsTM. They represent more than 17 percent of our front store sales, and they accounted for 26 percent of our front store sales growth over the past four years. We have an aggressive plan in place to improve both the quality and packaging of our store brands, and we believe that they can reach at least 20 percent of front store sales in the next few years. As we work to drive growth in existing stores, we have also continued to open locations and to enter new markets. In 2012, we opened 150 new or relocated stores in the United States. Factoring in closings, net units increased by 131 stores. That equates to 2.1 percent retail square footage growth for the year, in line with our annual goal. Moreover, our acquisition of privately held Drogaria Onofre in January 2013 marked our first foray into drugstore operations outside the United States. This transaction includes 44 retail locations in and around Sao Paulo, Brazil, which we view as a highly attractive growth market. I’ve said many times that our approach to international expansion would be measured and that we will continue to exercise strong financial discipline. Onofre, with its strong reputation, represents an excellent opportunity to grow the business over time. MinuteClinic’s expansion included increased focus on non-acute care, new locations, and health system affiliations A year from now, millions of Americans will begin to gain access to coverage as part of U.S. health care reform. This coming growth in demand will further exacerbate the current shortage of primary care physicians. Our expanding network of MinuteClinic locations will help address both the access issues related to this shortage as well as the rising cost of delivering care. The largest and fastest-growing retail medical clinic provider in the country, MinuteClinic has approximately 640 locations within CVS/pharmacy stores in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Each offers convenient, cost-effective care seven days a week without appointment. Insurers understand MinuteClinic’s value proposition, which is why visits are covered by more than 250 different commercial and government health plans.
MinuteClinic’s 2,000 nurse practitioners and physician assistants have cared for nearly 15 million patients, more than eight million of them in the past three years alone. Although acute care accounts for the majority of visits, non-acute services such as immunizations, physicals, and chronic disease monitoring have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 41 percent over the past three years. In 2012, these services accounted for about 17 percent of total volume, a figure that should continue to rise in the coming years. We expect to open 150 new clinics in 2013, with a long-term goal of operating 1,500 clinics in more than 35 states by 2017. MinuteClinic’s expanding footprint supports our growth strategy on a number of fronts. Collaborating with our PBM on service offerings strengthens our appeal and value proposition to regional and national accounts. It also increases MinuteClinic’s value as a partner to some of the nation’s leading health systems and positions us to play an important role in new health care delivery systems, such as accountable care organizations. We are keenly focused on future growth opportunities Given all the change that is underway in health care, it is critically important that we are able to pivot to serve the changing needs of our clients and customers. We believe that our business model is well aligned with the longer-term trends in the industry and uniquely positions us to drive value for our clients and customers in this rapidly changing environment. Given this, we’ve done a substantial amount of work to more clearly define our long-term strategic growth framework to ensure that we capitalize on these significant opportunities. Our enterprise growth strategy represents not a change, but an evolution of our thinking. We’ve defined a threepronged strategy to capitalize on market opportunities we foresee with our unique suite of assets: • First, we will create greater health care value by increasing the convenience and quality of care; we are expanding and differentiating our services for better health at lower costs. • Second, we will serve new and existing customers in new ways; our teams from across the enterprise are focused on identifying and targeting opportunities to better serve the fastest-growing customer segments. • And third, we will optimize our enterprise assets by delivering innovative solutions that leverage our unmatched breadth of capabilities. As we look ahead, our strategic growth framework will provide the lens through which we will make strategic investments and prioritize initiatives. We plan to grow share organically in our core businesses, and we will make investments and use bolt-on acquisitions to advance faster in areas with higher market momentum. We expect that this strategy will lead to continued healthy earnings growth and substantial free cash flow, which we will deploy to enhance shareholder value. In closing, I want to thank our board of directors for their valued support throughout the year. I also want to thank all the other stakeholders that contribute to CVS Caremark’s success – from our shareholders and customers to our more than 200,000 colleagues. Our people are helping us change the definition of pharmacy care, and they are positioning us to play a major role in the evolving delivery of health care in the United States.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2013,"The U.S. health care landscape is currently undergoing its most transformative change in decades, due in large part to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). More than 30 million Americans are expected to gain health care coverage by 2018, with enrollment expansion occurring primarily through Medicare, Medicaid, and the public exchanges. Health care consumers are taking on greater responsibility for choosing their own plans and controlling costs – what we’re calling the “retailization” of health care. In this environment, payors and physicians are increasingly looking for new ways to improve the health care value equation. As a pharmacy innovation company, CVS Caremark has the unique combination of ability and agility needed to capitalize on these changing market dynamics. Our PBM business serves more than 63 million plan members and has strong positions in the rapidly growing Medicare, Medicaid, and specialty pharmacy markets. Through our 7,600 retail pharmacies, we engage directly with more than five million customers daily. We also operate the nation’s largest retail medical care clinic, with 800 MinuteClinic® locations. The combination of these assets allows us to offer innovative and cost-effective solutions that enhance access to care and deliver better health outcomes to our clients and customers – all while we gain a greater share of their pharmacy and health care spend. Integrated pharmacy health care model is driving significant shareholder value This letter will expand on these and other topics shortly. First, I want to share some highlights of our outstanding results in 2013. They reflect our ongoing focus on the three pillars that we consider keys to enhancing value for CVS Caremark shareholders: • Driving productive, long-term growth; • Generating significant free cash flow; and • Optimizing capital allocation. Net revenues for the year increased 3 percent to a record $127 billion, while adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 23 percent to $4.00. We achieved solid growth enterprise-wide, gaining share in claims dispensed and managed. CVS Caremark dispensed more than 80 percent of prescriptions with generic drugs in 2013, thereby lowering costs for patients and payors while driving greater profitability. Despite an unprecedented level of brand-to-generic conversions in 2012 and 2013, we still anticipate significant new generic introductions over the next few years. We recently announced an exciting 10-year agreement with Cardinal Health to form the largest generic-sourcing entity in the United States. We will collaborate with generic manufacturers to develop innovative purchasing methodologies, improve supply chain efficiencies, and use our compelling scale to create attractive offerings for these suppliers. The power of our integrated model has created a sustainable competitive advantage for us. This is highlighted by the growth of CVS/pharmacy’s share of our own PBM’s retail network claims. That figure has jumped from 19 percent in 2008 – just following our merger – to 30 percent in 2013. This is a clear indicator that our channel-agnostic approach is better positioned to capture share over the long-term, regardless of changes in payor mix, plan design strategies, or patient preferences. We generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow in 2013, and we returned more than $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend by 38 percent in 2013 and recently announced another 22 percent increase for 2014, which marks our 11th consecutive year of increases. This recent dividend increase should allow us to achieve a 25 percent payout ratio sometime this year, up from 14 percent in 2010. Looking forward, we recently set a target payout ratio of 35 percent by 2018 as we continue to focus on returning value to our shareholders. Furthermore, after spending approximately $11 billion on share repurchases from 2011 through 2013, our board of directors recently authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. Our current plans call for the repurchase of approximately $4 billion of our shares in 2014, consistent with last year. Our 2013 acquisitions of Drogaria Onofre and NovoLogix, and of Coram, which closed in January 2014, offer good examples of how we apply disciplined capital allocation practices to supplement existing assets and bolster our offerings. Drogaria Onofre, a 46-store retail drugstore chain in Brazil, represents our first retail foray into the international markets, while NovoLogix and Coram have broadened our already compelling specialty solutions. Our focus on enhancing shareholder value paid off handsomely in 2013, with our shares producing a total return to shareholders of 50.4 percent for the year. That far surpassed the total returns of both the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average over the same period. We have outperformed these broader indices on a three-, five-, and 10-year basis as well. Our differentiated PBM offerings continue to gain momentum Our PBM business posted another strong year in 2013 with nice momentum heading into 2014. For the 2014 selling season, gross new business wins totaled $5.3 billion. Factoring in a 96 percent retention rate, we gained approximately $2.4 billion in client net new business for 2014. Not reflected in that number is $1.3 billion in lost revenue in 2014 resulting from last year’s Medicare Part D sanction. I’m pleased to report that the sanction was lifted on January 1, 2014, and that we have once again started enrolling new members into our SilverScript prescription drug plans (PDPs) as they age into the Medicare program. Although price is still a very important part of their decision process, clients are telling us that we’re also being selected because of the unique capabilities we deliver. Among them, our Pharmacy Advisor® program helps participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications, and better manage their health conditions. We have also expanded this program to Medicare beneficiaries, which is helping health plan clients achieve better clinical star ratings. Maintenance Choice® remains a unique offering in the market that no competitor has been able to replicate. It allows plan members to receive their 90-day maintenance prescriptions by mail or at one of our convenient retail stores for the same price. Client adoption has risen significantly over the past two years, with 17 million members currently enrolled, up 55 percent in that time frame. Moreover, significant opportunity for growth remains, with potential adoption among current clients representing up to a total of 34 million members. Regarding our long-term partnership with Aetna, we have successfully completed the migration of Aetna’s commercial membership to our destination platform. Aetna’s Medicare Part D business will transition in 
January 2015. With the Aetna commercial business now on our platform, Aetna has the ability to market CVS Caremark’s integrated offerings as well. Back in 2010, we undertook an extensive PBM streamlining initiative that included consolidating our facilities, redesigning our pharmacy front-end processes, opening two new automated mail order pharmacies, and consolidating our claims adjudication systems. These programs are on track to deliver cumulative savings of more than $1 billion by the end of 2015. Our comprehensive specialty offering helps improve outcomes and lower costs Specialty pharmacy continues to grow at a much faster rate than the pharmacy industry overall, with industry projections for this market to grow from $92 billion in 2012 to $235 billion by 2018. By that time, specialty pharmaceuticals are expected to account for 50 percent of the total spent on drugs in the United States. CVS Caremark’s specialty business is growing faster than the overall market, with specialty revenues expected to reach $26 billion in 2014. Many believe that specialty medications represent the pinnacle of achievement in biologic science and have revolutionized the treatment of a host of debilitating and life-threatening illnesses. At the same time, managing these expensive agents and the specialty patient population brings its own share of complexities, and our clients are clamoring for help in controlling the rapidly rising costs. CVS Caremark has assembled what we believe to be the most complete and coordinated solution in our industry to address the needs of specialty patients and payors. Our solutions include comprehensive trend management in which CVS Caremark aggressively manages all drugs irrespective of route of administration or site of service, or whether a drug is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit. Our acquisition of the NovoLogix technology gives us automated medical claims management capabilities that no other large PBM offers. Our differentiated clinical care model integrates our Accordant® rare disease care management services to enhance care and reduce costs. Our clinical model can reduce total health care spending for specialty patients by as much as 11 percent. Through our Specialty Connect™ integrated delivery option, patients also have the flexibility to receive their drugs by mail or at one of our stores. This program is analogous to Maintenance Choice. Our pilot launch of Specialty Connect has revealed that half of specialty patients prefer to pick up their drugs at a CVS/pharmacy location and that this program is helping to drive improved adherence rates. Finally, our acquisition of Coram has significantly expanded our capabilities in the infusion market. Coram serves 165,000 patients annually through its 85 branch locations and 600 home infusion nurses around the country. Coram also complements our existing specialty competencies, creating cross-selling opportunities and making us a compelling option for narrow networks that are trying to improve outcomes while driving down costs. CVS/pharmacy® stores are in the right growth markets and outperforming competitors on medication adherence Our retail business posted solid results in 2013, especially given the continued evidence of a cautious consumer. Same-store sales grew by 1.7 percent overall, with the pharmacy up 2.6 percent and the front of the store down 0.5 percent. Our stores now command a 21.3 percent share of the U.S. retail prescription drug market, and we are poised to capitalize on health care reform over the next few years. With 30 million Americans expected to gain health care coverage through the public exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid, we believe that we are well-positioned with the power and reach of our brand, as well as the trusting relationships that exist between our 23,000 pharmacists and millions of patients. Turning to our real estate program, we opened 247 new or relocated stores in 2013. Factoring in closings, net units increased by 156 stores. That equates to 2.4 percent retail square footage growth for the year, in line with our annual goal. We expect to continue to expand our retail square footage at roughly the same pace going forward. Looking at just the top 10 states that are expected to see the largest increases in their insurance rolls – California, Texas, and Florida topping the list – we already have strong market positions with plans to expand in counties where the greatest opportunities exist.
Our pharmacists executed close to 80 million live clinical interventions during the year. That helped CVS/pharmacy deliver best-in-class adherence results compared to our top three retail competitors in areas that include diabetes therapy, cholesterol therapy, and blood pressure therapy. Among patients that take medication for high blood pressure, our adherence rate translates into the prevention of 20,000 heart attacks, 5,000 strokes, and 3,000 deaths each year. These outcomes are obviously meaningful to our patients and their families. They also broadly benefit a health care system that incurs $300 billion in avoidable medical costs each year due to medication non-adherence. ExtraCare® and store-brand initiatives continue to drive profitable sales in the front of the store Our ExtraCare loyalty program has been a key driver of our profitable front store sales, and it is helping us deliver a more personalized experience to each customer. The industry’s longest-running loyalty program, ExtraCare has 70 million active cardholders who accounted for 70 percent of front store transactions during the past year. These cardholders get two percent back every day and received $3.6 billion in ExtraBucks savings and rewards in 2013. It’s important to note that we have spent 16 years gathering insights and perfecting ExtraCare, which means that no competitor can match the depth of our customer analytics. We’ve leveraged our ExtraCare insights to convert customers to categories they shop elsewhere, to launch personalized digital circulars, and to tailor our merchandise mix to better meet customer needs. Our store and proprietary brands represent another key driver of profitable front store sales growth. These products are sold under a variety of proprietary labels such as Gold Emblem™ and Essence of Beauty® and accounted for 17.8 percent of front store sales in 2013. Importantly, they also provide significantly higher margins than national brands while saving our customers money. We have an aggressive strategy in place to move their penetration to well over 20 percent in the next few years. MinuteClinic® provides unmatched offerings to our PBM clients and aligns with leading health systems MinuteClinic today represents a small percentage of our revenues, but it is significant to our overall health care strategy and is expected to play an important role in the rapidly evolving health care system. Our 2,200 nurse practitioners and physician assistants provide high-quality, affordable walk-in medical care services seven days a week without appointments. With more than 800 clinics currently in 28 states and the District of Columbia, MinuteClinic is expected to grow to 1,500 locations in over 35 states by 2017. Through this expanding network of locations, MinuteClinic will play an important role in helping alleviate the growing shortage of primary care physicians in the United States, especially as more people obtain health insurance. MinuteClinic now has more than 30 major health system affiliations, adding seven in 2013 alone. We are working with the nation’s leading health care systems to ensure that patients receive high-quality, cost-effective care at the appropriate site of service. MinuteClinic is becoming an integral part of the services these organizations offer as they develop accountable care organizations, patient-centered medical homes, and other new models of care. In addition to providing care for common acute illnesses, injuries, and skin conditions, MinuteClinic offers chronic disease and wellness services while integrating medical records with primary care providers. As we look for new ways of improving care while lowering costs, we will offer innovative new services such as TeleHealth™ at MinuteClinic, which is currently being piloted in certain markets. The new health care environment presents growth opportunities across our enterprise With health care reform and major demographic shifts underway in the United States, our industry landscape is poised to change significantly in the coming years. There are a number of moving parts related to coverage expansion, and the initial rollout of the ACA has come with its challenges. That said, we continue to expect that coverage expansion will provide a long-term tailwind for the industry. The importance of government payors and health plans is clearly rising, and we believe that CVS Caremark is very well-positioned for this trend. We have strong positions in the Medicare and Medicaid markets across both our retail and PBM businesses. Let’s look at Managed Medicaid, where 30 million people are currently enrolled. This number is expected 
to increase to 43 million people by 2016. Growth will come from the continuing transition of fee-for-service Medicaid members to Managed Medicaid as well as from new enrollees resulting from the ACA’s expanded eligibility. CVS Caremark is the clear market leader among Managed Medicaid PBMs with a 28 percent share of covered lives, and our capabilities will help us maintain this position. We also have a 20 percent share of Medicaid prescription volumes through our retail stores. Our retail footprint and capabilities give us an opportunity to gain even greater share as Managed Medicaid providers show an interest in narrowing their retail pharmacy networks to save costs. The Medicare Part D market remains a very important part of our growth strategy as well. With 15 million people aging into Medicare by 2020, drug spending in the Medicare space is expected to grow at an 8.6 percent compounded annual growth rate. We remain the number three player in the PBM market, covering 6.8 million lives through our SilverScript product or through our health plan clients where we serve as the PBM. We will also participate in coverage expansion through both public and private health insurance exchanges. Looking at the private exchanges, we can reach active employees not only through our commercial health plan partners, but also through direct relationships on key exchanges. We connect with Medicare-eligible retirees through our MA-PD and PDP health plan partners and our CVS Caremark SilverScript PDP. Looking at public exchanges, our PBM covers 70 percent of the eligible exchange population through our health plan customer relationships. Access to the exchange population rises further if you factor in states where we have CVS/pharmacy preferred-network relationships. With the growth in exchanges and government lines of business, our ability to serve health plans whether or not they are PBM clients is increasingly important. Leveraging our retail footprint, we can support health plan marketing initiatives ranging from limited pilot marketing programs to full-scale educational programs. Some of our health plan partnerships also include participation in preferred or restricted pharmacy networks. Many plans are taking advantage of MinuteClinic’s convenient and affordable services as well as cost-saving PBM services and programs to better manage rising specialty pharmacy costs. Our recently announced decision to remove cigarettes and all tobacco products from our store shelves by October 2014 has generated an overwhelmingly positive response from customers, health plan and employer clients, legislators, and public health and Medicaid officials. They all see the health benefit of this move and the role that pharmacy can play in smoking cessation. Some 16 million people in this country already have at least one disease from smoking, and it still accounts for approximately 480,000 deaths each year. Simply put, the sale of tobacco is inconsistent with our corporate purpose of helping people on their path to better health. As the delivery of health care evolves with an emphasis on better health outcomes, reducing chronic disease, and controlling costs, we’re playing an expanded role in providing care through our pharmacists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This significant action further distinguishes us in how we are serving our patients, clients, and health care providers, and better positions us for continued growth in the evolving health care marketplace. Although this decision will have some impact on revenues and profits, we believe that it is the right thing to do given our expanding role as a health care company. Clearly, we are in the midst of an exciting and pivotal moment for our company and our industry. In closing, I want to thank our board of directors, our shareholders, and the more than 200,000 colleagues who have played such an important role in CVS Caremark’s achievements. They have worked hard to develop our sustainable competitive advantage and to meet the needs of the health care system of the future.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2014,"The past year has been a milestone year for our company as we continued to broaden our role as a pharmacy innovation company. The evidence can be seen everywhere—from the outstanding selling season of our pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) and formation of new health care alliances to the ongoing expansion of our retail pharmacies and the elimination of tobacco products from our stores. Importantly, we have changed our corporate name to CVS Health. Our company is at the forefront of an evolving health care landscape, and our new name underscores our commitment to helping people on their path to better health. We are delivering breakthrough products and services to increase access to care, improve health outcomes, and lower overall health care costs. We foresaw many of the changes occurring in health care, and we began assembling an unmatched suite of integrated assets back in 2007 that have positioned us to capitalize on the opportunities created, both now and in the future. CVS Health remains a one-of-a-kind company. Ours is the only integrated pharmacy model with a deep understanding of the diverse needs of consumers, payors, and providers, and these insights inform our innovative, channel-agnostic solutions. We met our 2014 financial targets while creating significant shareholder value Before expanding on these and other topics, I want to provide a brief overview of our strong financial performance in 2014. Once again, we met or exceeded all our key financial targets through our ongoing focus on the three pillars that we consider essential to maximizing shareholder value: driving productive, long-term growth; generating significant free cash flow; and optimizing capital allocation. Net revenues for the year increased nearly 10 percent to a record $139 billion, while adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $4.49—up 13.5 percent (excluding the loss
on early extinguishment of debt in 2014 and the gain from a legal settlement in 2013). And we achieved this strong growth even after forgoing approximately 8 cents in earnings per share from exiting the tobacco category. We’ve benefited from a number of growth drivers, especially our ability to increase enterprise share of prescriptions dispensed through our many channels. We also filled more than 80 percent of prescriptions using generic equivalents, which are more cost effective for patients and payors and are more profitable for us than branded drugs. Looking ahead, more than $40 billion of branded drugs are expected to lose patent protection and effectively be replaced by generic equivalents between 2015 and 2017. Furthermore, we completed the formation of our Red Oak Sourcing venture with Cardinal Health to create the largest generic sourcing entity in the United States. Our combined scale, along with our knowledge and expertise, should lead to even greater savings for our clients, their members, and CVS Health. We generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow in 2014 and once again returned more than $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by 22 percent last year and recently approved a 27 percent increase for 2015. That marks our 12th consecutive year of increases and keeps us solidly on track toward our dividend payout ratio target of 35 percent by 2018. With our December 2014 announcement of a new $10 billion share repurchase program, we began 2015 with approximately $12.7 billion available to repurchase CVS Health shares when we identify favorable opportunities. More than $7 billion is expected to be returned to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2015. CVS Health shares produced a total return of 36.6 percent in 2014. Over the same period, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 13.7 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively. We have outperformed these indices on a three-, five-, and 10-year basis as well. Our 2014 stock performance also outpaced the 25.3 percent return of the S&P 500 Health Care Index. Our core strengths and integrated offerings drove another successful PBM selling season Our CVS/caremark PBM offers competitive pricing, high levels of service and execution, and unmatched services that continue to resonate with payors. As a result, 2014 revenues increased by 16 percent to $88 billion in our Pharmacy Services segment. After a successful selling season, we started 2015 with $7.0 billion in gross new business spread among health plans, government payors, and employers. With a 96 percent retention rate, net new business for 2015 totaled $3.6 billion. Clients value the strength of CVS/caremark’s adherence programs, specialty services, and advanced formulary strategies. Pharmacy Advisor, Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect, and our other integrated offerings have played an increasingly important role in our ability to win and retain business. At present, no other PBM can offer these differentiated services and capabilities. Pharmacy Advisor, our industry-leading clinical program for plan members with chronic diseases, currently addresses diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and eight other disease states. Now available to our Medicare and Medicaid plans as well, it is helping them improve the clinical star measures that impact their reimbursement rates. With more than 20 million plan members enrolled in Maintenance Choice in 2015, growth in participation has exceeded 85 percent in just three years. We are also seeing growing interest in our new Specialty Connect delivery option. Similar to Maintenance Choice, it offers specialty patients the flexibility to receive their prescriptions by mail or at one of our stores. CVS/caremark’s retail network claims have risen significantly over the past six years, from about 575 million to 930 million prescriptions. Over the same period, CVS/pharmacy’s share of the CVS/caremark book of business has grown from 19 percent to approximately 31 percent. We are gaining a growing share of a growing business, highlighting the success of our channel-agnostic approach and the power of our integrated business model. PBM clients are also increasingly incorporating CVS/minuteclinic services into their plans, improving member access to health care while lowering overall costs. For example, our pilot plan to reduce or eliminate co-payments for plan members now covers 1.2 million lives. That’s up from 88,000 in 2012. We are reinventing specialty with a unique suite of assets to address rising costs Our specialty pharmacy business continues to grow rapidly, with revenues from the specialty drugs we dispensed and managed across the enterprise totaling $31 billion in 2014. The overall specialty market is projected to reach $235 billion and 50 percent of total drug spend by 2018—compared with just 38 percent this past year—as utilization of costly new therapies 
ncreases. Hepatitis C drugs such as Sovaldi® and Harvoni™ as well as PCSK9 inhibitors, an anticipated new class of drugs for lowering cholesterol, are notable examples of high-cost therapies expected to drive the rapid growth in specialty pharmacy. This trend imposes a substantial burden on both patients and payors as they seek ways to control costs. Our clients count on us to manage these expensive specialty medications to ensure appropriate utilization through a combination of prior authorization, formulary management, and other innovative clinical programs. That’s why we’ve been working hard to reinvent specialty pharmacy.
In specialty, we led the market in 2013 with formulary strategies using clinically appropriate and cost-effective solutions and we continued to lead in 2014. We also have unparalleled capabilities to manage specialty patients holistically, not just their drug costs, and our clinical support and site-of-care management helps drive superior outcomes. We’ve integrated our Accordant rare disease care management services to enhance care and reduce costs, rolled out Specialty Connect, and made key acquisitions such as Coram and NovoLogix to broaden our portfolio. CVS/pharmacy posted solid results despite exit from tobacco category and continued to gain share CVS/pharmacy continued to gain market share in both the pharmacy and the front of the store in 2014 even as consumers remained cost conscious. Our core pharmacy business has grown three times faster than that of other drug chains over the same period, and we hold a 21 percent share of the U.S. retail prescription drug market. For the year, same-store sales rose 2.1 percent, with the pharmacy up 4.8 percent and the front of the store down 4.0 percent. Our underlying front store growth was obscured by the negative impact on revenue from exiting the tobacco category. It has now been five months since we became the first national pharmacy chain to eliminate cigarettes and other tobacco products from our shelves, a move that reflects our corporate purpose and is expected to help drive long-term growth. As expected, exiting the tobacco category will cost us approximately $2 billion in revenues on an annualized basis—$1.5 billion from tobacco sales specifically and approximately another $500 million from the rest of those shoppers’ baskets. That amounted to about 8 cents in earnings per share in 2014, and it is expected to cost an incremental 8 to 9 cents per share in 2015 for a total annual impact of approximately 17 cents per share. Yet our decision better aligns us with payors and providers as they search for ways to improve health outcomes and control costs. That should make us a more attractive partner for dispensing and other services, ultimately helping us recapture this lost revenue elsewhere across the enterprise. Health and beauty remained key drivers of front store sales in 2014, with market shares rising to 36 and 40 percent, respectively. Our store brands continued to generate profitable sales growth, accounting for 19 percent of front store sales. Given our success, we’ve set a new goal of increasing store brand penetration to 25 percent of front store sales. Like generic drugs in the pharmacy, store brands provide significantly higher margins than national brands while also saving our customers money. The past year saw our successful launch of the Makeup Academy™ and radiance® PLATINUM lines as well as more than 40 items under the new Gold Emblem Abound™ healthy snack brand. As we look to the future, we will continue to provide our customers with additional healthy options. Our goal is to make CVS/pharmacy the convenience destination for more, better, and healthier choices. In research we have conducted since the tobacco announcement, customers have made healthy food their number one choice among offerings they would like to see added. Moreover, these products are less sensitive to promotion, which aligns with our strategy to drive profitable growth. Our adherence programs and partnerships are providing value to our PBM and non-PBM patients alike Our channel-agnostic pharmacy care model has played a key role in enhancing member services and driving share gains. Plan members are embracing our unique offerings, and we’ve also endeavored to improve our value to our retail customers who are covered by other PBMs. They are benefiting from our best-in-class clinical 
programs to help treat chronic conditions as well as from the innovative partnerships we have forged with providers and payors. Adherence to prescription drug regimens is critical to improving patient health and reducing costs, and CVS/pharmacy’s adherence rates lead the industry. For example, our medication possession ratios for customers undergoing therapy for diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure are eight percentage points higher than those of our top three retail competitors. That translates into lower mortality rates, fewer heart attacks and strokes, better quality of life, and a reduction in overall health care costs. Among our partnerships, we’re working with hospital providers to ensure that patients have the proper outpatient medications in hand before discharge. We follow up after patients return home to answer questions and confirm medication adherence. With the rise of consumerism driven in large part by the increasing numbers of individuals in consumer-driven health plans, what we’re calling the retailization of health care, CVS/pharmacy has also partnered with a number of health plan clients on a variety of initiatives that help them reach out to consumers directly. For example, we host in-store events to drive member acquisition and have launched a solution that enables health plan members to pay their insurance premiums at their local CVS/pharmacy. We’ve also introduced HeathTag®, which allows us to deliver messages from our health plan partners to patients, such as a reminder to get an A1C blood sugar screening when picking up a prescription. Importantly, these relationships position us to be anchors in their limited or preferred networks. We continue to enter new markets and use ExtraCare to drive profitable growth The vast majority of the U.S. population lives within a few miles of a CVS/pharmacy, and we’ve continued to expand our footprint in existing markets as well as by entering new markets such as Seattle. Overall, we opened or acquired 184 new stores in 2014. Factoring in closings, net units increased by 162 stores. That equates to two percent retail square footage growth for the year, in line with our annual goal. Our September 2014 acquisition of Miami-based Navarro Discount Pharmacy® has strengthened our position in the Hispanic marketplace, the fastest growing demographic in the United States. Over the next decade, the U.S. Hispanic population is expected to increase by 25 percent to 71 million lives. Navarro has been serving Hispanic consumers for more than 50 years and now has 33 retail drugstore locations. We are leveraging its expertise to help make CVS/pharmacy stores in Hispanic neighborhoods across the country even more relevant to the customers we serve every day. In all our locations, the ExtraCare loyalty program continues to play an indispensable role in driving profitable front store sales. The industry’s longest-running loyalty program is now in its 17th year and was used in more than 80 percent of front store sales in 2014. It has allowed us to gather critical consumer insights that we use every day to enhance the CVS/pharmacy shopping experience and to invest in those customers who provide the most value. For example, we’re now leveraging the knowledge we’ve gained through ExtraCare to deliver personalized offers to our 70 million active cardholders. This includes 25 million e-mails a week and 90 million mail pieces annually. In 2014, cardholders redeemed a total of 38 million personalized coupons. The ongoing decline in newspaper circulation will only increase our advantage over competitors who rely more heavily on circulars to drive trips to their stores. As always, cardholders also get 2 percent back on purchases every day and received $4 billion in ExtraBucks® savings and rewards in 2014. CVS Health’s robust digital strategy empowers consumers to navigate their pharmacy experiences and manage their conditions through our online and mobile tools. This includes the ability to get next-in-line text alerts at CVS/minuteclinic and, in the future, the ability to schedule appointments. Our mobile app has received critical acclaim for ease of use, while our text message program has experienced significant growth. CVS/minuteclinic excels at customer satisfaction while broadening its preventative and chronic care offerings CVS/minuteclinic continued its rapid growth, ending the year with more than 970 clinics in 31 states and the District of Columbia, up from 800 clinics in the prior year. Since its inception, CVS/minuteclinic’s 2,700 nurse practitioners and physician assistants have provided care for more than 23 million patient visits. We will continue to add more locations and enter new markets in 2015 and remain on track to reach 1,500 locations by the end of 2017. Along with our rapid growth, we have continued to deliver the high levels of satisfaction and quality for which CVS/minuteclinic is known. Our net promoter score, a third-party measure of how likely it is that 
our services would be recommended to friends or colleagues, has grown over the past two years. Among health care organizations, our scores are unmatched. Our own research published in the October 2014 edition of The American Journal of Managed Care shows that CVS/minuteclinic’s quality performance matches or exceeds that of other ambulatory care settings for three common health conditions.
Although CVS/minuteclinic is largely known for treating sore throats, ear infections, and other acute conditions, we are focused on expanding its scope of services. That includes adding chronic disease monitoring and treatment for conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. We have expanded our biometric monitoring, tobacco cessation, and weight loss programs. We undertake chronic care only when working with primary care doctors to complement the services they offer. Our affiliations with major health systems throughout the United States—and two-way integration of our electronic medical records—heighten our ability to provide collaborative care. We added 19 health systems in 2014, ending the year with 49 such affiliations. Growth of government programs and exchanges presents significant opportunities across our enterprise Government programs represent a tremendous growth opportunity for us, and we have strong positions in both the Medicare and Medicaid markets. The United States is in the midst of what we are calling a “silver tsunami,” with some 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day. This means that more than 17 million new people will be eligible for Medicare by 2019. CVS Health serves this market through our SilverScript Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, as the PBM for our health plan Medicare clients, and through Employer Group Waiver Plans. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, we have seen significant growth in Medicaid over the past year with states expanding eligibility. This growth will likely continue as more states evaluate their Medicaid expansion decisions. At the same time, the growth of managed Medicaid over traditional fee-for-service models has been fueled by states seeking cost savings opportunities. CVS/caremark participates in managed Medicaid through health plan clients, and our 19 percent share makes us an industry leader. Medicaid also currently accounts for 14 percent of prescriptions dispensed at CVS/pharmacy locations. Our retail footprint and capabilities give us an opportunity to gain even greater share as managed Medicaid providers narrow their retail pharmacy networks to save costs. The next several years are expected to bring continued growth in the number of people seeking insurance through the public exchanges. Additionally, we believe some employers will explore private exchanges as a viable option to reduce health care spending for their retirees. CVS/caremark participates on the public and private exchanges on a carve-in basis with health plan clients. On the private exchanges, we also participate on a carve-out basis as a standalone PBM where we offer prescription benefits directly. We expect the growth in exchange lives to provide an incremental lift to our retail pharmacy as utilization increases. Clearly, we are seeing tremendous opportunities for growth throughout the enterprise, and I believe that our integrated model will allow us to take full advantage of them. In closing, I want to thank our board of directors and the 217,000 colleagues who work so diligently across CVS Health. They have committed themselves to our unique model of pharmacy care and have given us a compelling advantage in today’s marketplace. To my fellow shareholders, thank you for your continued confidence in our strategy.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2015,"CVS Health enjoyed a successful 2015 that was highlighted by excellent performance across our enterprise and two key acquisitions that support our strategy for growth in an evolving health care market. That strategy is focused on creating superior value for patients, payors, and providers through an unmatched suite of integrated assets. From our nationwide retail footprint to our leading pharmacy benefits management (PBM) and specialty businesses, and now our leading presence in long-term pharmacy care, we have forged a competitive advantage that is helping us benefit from a broad range of market trends. They include the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the aging U.S. population, and increased prescription utilization. Of the roughly 710 million prescriptions added to the market over the past five years, CVS Health has captured 39 percent through one of our dispensing channels. In other words, we are growing our share of an expanding market. CVS Health is truly a one-of-a-kind company that helps patients get the care they need through the channel that works best for them. Products such as Maintenance Choice®, Specialty ConnectTM, and Pharmacy Advisor® remain unmatched in the marketplace. In specialty, we have unparalleled capabilities to holistically manage patients, provide clinical support, and drive superior outcomes. As clients look to drive down overall health care costs, our growing volumes—along with our Red Oak generic sourcing venture with Cardinal Health—create unparalleled scale and purchasing expertise that help them best accomplish this. And we certainly aren’t standing still. We broadened our reach in 2015 with the acquisition of Omnicare, the nation’s leading provider of pharmacy services to the long-term care market. Omnicare dispenses 100 million scripts annually to approximately 2 million patients. We also grew our core pharmacy business with the purchase of more than 1,670 pharmacies and nearly 80 retail clinics from Target Corporation. This transaction, which closed in December, expanded our pharmacy count by 20 percent and our number of clinics by 8 percent. I’ll have more to say about both of these acquisitions, but let me first offer a brief overview of CVS Health’s financial performance.
Record revenue and earnings helped us return more than $6 billion to shareholders Once again, we met or exceeded all of our key financial targets through our ongoing focus on three pillars that we consider essential to maximizing shareholder value: • Productive, long-term growth; • Generating significant free cash flow; and • Optimizing capital allocation. Net revenues for the year increased 10 percent to a record $153 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose nearly 15 percent to $5.16 on a comparable basis. That excludes amortization, acquisition-related costs, and a charge related to a disputed 1999 legal settlement in 2015; it excludes amortization and the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2014. Looking back at the steady state targets we introduced in 2010 for the subsequent five-year period, I am happy to report that the company’s growth hit the higher end of each target range. Operating profit has risen at a 10 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), while adjusted EPS has grown at a 14 percent CAGR. CVS Health generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow during 2015 and returned more than $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by 27 percent and approved an additional 21 percent increase for 2016. That marks our 13th consecutive year of increases and keeps us on track to reach a 35 percent dividend payout ratio target by 2018. We expect to return more than $5 billion to shareholders in 2016 through dividends and share repurchases. The Omnicare and Target deals represent efficient strategic uses of our capital that will help drive long-term growth. Even after financing both acquisitions through debt, we still have a strong balance sheet with well-laddered debt maturities. We maintain a high triple-B credit rating that allows CVS Health to continue to effectively finance the working capital needs of the company. While the stock market has been tumultuous, CVS Health shares produced a total return of 2.9 percent in 2015 to outperform the major indices. Over the same period, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 1.4 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. We have notably outperformed these indices on a three-, five-, and 10-year basis as well. High retention rates and new business wins reflect the value of the CVS Caremark® PBM model The capabilities of CVS Caremark remain unmatched in the PBM marketplace, fueling strong top- and bottom-line growth in 2015. Another highly successful selling season resulted in $14.8 billion in gross new client business to start 2016. While health plans accounted for roughly 80 percent of our wins, we were also very successful in the employer segment with more than 90 new clients totaling $1.8 billion in revenue. With a 98 percent client retention rate, net new client business for 2016 totaled $12.7 billion. 
We are winning with our strong record of service and execution, our competitive pricing, and by bringing unique solutions to the market to meet a broad range of client concerns. Surveys have shown that cost control is our clients’ top priority. This is followed by a variety of additional factors, with each of our client channels having different priorities. Our flexibility and expertise in addressing them has certainly been key to our success. We led the market with the first formulary exclusions in 2012, ensuring patient access to high-quality medications at the lowest possible cost to clients. Since that time, we’ve identified additional exclusions on an annual basis. Most recently, we took bold steps in 2015 with Hepatitis C medications and PCSK9 inhibitors. These expensive therapies are key potential drivers of rising costs—or “trend”—for clients. Through our strategies, we expect to have saved clients $6.4 billion for the five-year period through 2016. Oversight and strategic pharmacy management cut our clients’ trend by more than half in 2015, despite record levels of drug price increases. This past year we also launched a valuable surveillance and reporting tool—Interactive Rx Insights—that allows our sales team to simulate the impact of plan designs and show clients how specific solutions reduce the impact of trend drivers. Our Medicare Part D (Med D) business had another successful Annual Enrollment Period for 2016. The SilverScript® Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) added 500,000 lives, raising total enrollment to 5 million captive PDP lives, including Employee Group Waiver Plans. When 
adding the Med D lives we manage for our health plan clients, the total rises to more than 11 million Med D lives under management, up 41 percent from the prior year, and making us the clear leader in the Med D space. Through our enterprise clinical capabilities, we have an unmatched ability to drive Med D Star ratings—for SilverScript as well as our health plan clients’ offerings. In fact, SilverScript was the largest PDP to achieve a four-star rating, and 73 percent of our clients’ lives were enrolled in a high performing plan for the 2016 plan year. Our specialty business, with its breadth of offerings, has been a key driver of revenue gains Throughout 2015, we continued to capture an outsized share of the specialty market, the industry’s fastest-growing sector. Our CVS SpecialtyTM business is the nation’s largest, and our growth has outpaced both the industry overall and that of our nearest competitor. In 2015, revenues from the specialty drugs we dispensed and managed across the enterprise totaled nearly $40 billion, increasing 32 percent over the prior year. CVS Specialty offers all the traditional capabilities that payors expect from a specialty pharmacy. We’ve raised the bar as well by offering a unique range of differentiated solutions through our integrated model. Take our highly popular Specialty ConnectTM offering, which gives specialty patients the option of picking up their medications at any CVS Pharmacy® location or having the medication delivered by mail. More than 54 percent of our specialty patients prefer in-store pickup—along with the opportunity to consult with a pharmacist faceto-face—and we’ve served more than 100,000 of them in this way since we rolled out the program in 2014. Among specialty patients that opt for in-store pickup, we’ve seen adherence improve by 11.4 percent. Our differentiated offerings also include Accordant® rare disease case management and Coram® infusion services, both of which make CVS Specialty particularly attractive to manufacturers who want to launch new drugs through limited distribution networks. Only CVS Specialty has the NovoLogix® technology platform, enabling us to help our clients manage all specialty medications including those paid under the medical benefit. Retail pharmacy growth has outpaced our competitors while the Target deal further broadens our reach At CVS Pharmacy, same store sales increased 1.7 percent in 2015. Pharmacy same store sales rose 4.5 percent, while front store same store sales decreased 5 percent, driven primarily by our exit from tobacco sales in 2014. CVS Pharmacy filled 21.6 percent of all retail prescriptions in 2015 to lead the U.S. retail drugstore market. In fact, our retail prescription business has grown at twice the rate of the overall market since 2010. 
Although our integrated model has certainly played a key role in these results, nearly 44 percent of our prescription growth since 2013 has been driven by share gains from non-CVS Caremark payors. This is due in part to the many programs we have put in place to provide all customers with excellent service and value. Our growth has also led to valuable economies of scale. For example, our labor cost to fill prescriptions has fallen by approximately 13 percent (excluding wage inflation) over the past five years. Our stores are also playing an important role in what we call the retailization of health care. With the rise in consumer-directed health plans, it is imperative that patients stay on their medications. We encourage appropriate patient behavior through our industry-leading adherence programs. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has led increasing numbers of individuals to choose their own health plans on public exchanges. We can effectively support health plan partners with in-store displays and service centers that support their outreach efforts. I’ve already touched on the Target deal, which has expanded our presence to regions such as Seattle, Denver, Portland, and Salt Lake City. Across the enterprise, you can now find a CVS Health location in every U.S. state. We are currently in the process of rebranding these assets as CVS Pharmacy® and MinuteClinic® locations. CVS Pharmacy stores have typically filled twice the number of prescriptions as Target pharmacies, so these new locations represent a significant opportunity to drive script growth and profitability. In addition to the acquired Target locations, we opened 161 new stores in 2015. Factoring in closings, net units increased by 130 stores. For our PBM business, members now have approximately 9,600 CVS Pharmacy locations to choose from. That’s up from about 7,800 in 2014. This enhances the relevance of Pharmacy Advisor, Maintenance Choice, and our other integrated offerings since more members will benefit from easier access to them. Health and Beauty and ExtraCare® are driving front store gains; CVS MinuteClinic™ expands its scope of services In the front of the store, our average basket size in 2015 (after excluding the impact of our exit from tobacco) increased 2 percent—and 4 percent in our core health and beauty businesses. These results are gratifying given the lackluster trend in overall shopping visits across the retail landscape. Health and beauty offer higher margins and growth opportunities than other front store categories, and we are expanding our emphasis on both through a combination of store remodelings, merchandising enhancements, and improved product mix. Among other front store initiatives, shoppers have responded enthusiastically to our expanded healthy food options. We’ve also continued to strengthen our position with Hispanic customers, the fastest-growing demographic in the United States, by launching CVS Pharmacy y más™ in 12 locations in Miami. These stores offer hundreds of Hispanic products and services not found in traditional drugstores, and we saw sales in the test stores increase by an average of 10 percent. We expect to expand on this concept in 2016.
The ExtraCare loyalty program, now in its 18th year, continues to play an indispensable role in driving profitable front store sales across all our stores. It helps identify our higher-value shoppers so we can build on our relationship with them through personalized promotions. Such shoppers represent 30 percent of our retail customer base, but they are responsible for driving more than 80 percent of sales in the front of the store. It has been more than a year since we stopped selling tobacco in our stores, a move that better aligned our business practices with our goals as a health care company. At the time, we also reasoned that removing a convenient location to buy cigarettes could decrease overall tobacco use. A new study conducted by our CVS Health Research Institute has shown that approximately 95 million fewer packs were sold in states where CVS Pharmacy has a 15 percent or greater share of the retail pharmacy market compared to states without a large CVS Pharmacy presence. We continue to promote smoking cessation in a variety of other ways, with our 30,000 pharmacists and 3,100 nurse practitioners taking the lead. The expansion of CVS MinuteClinic continued in 2015, with the number of locations at year end totaling 1,135 in 33 states and Washington, D.C. That includes the 79 clinics we acquired from Target. More than 50 percent of the U.S. population now lives within 10 miles of a 
MinuteClinic, and we operate more retail clinics than all our competitors combined. CVS MinuteClinic plays an important, complementary role with traditional medical practices. Through our 2015 implementation of the Epic electronic health record platform, we are now sharing information with approximately 275 health systems and provider organizations. The Epic platform has also allowed us to expand the CVS MinuteClinic scope of services to cover 28 of the 50 most common primary care diagnoses. CVS MinuteClinic has been exploring a number of transformative digital offerings, such as telehealth, to improve access and convenience. This is just one of the many ways in which we have been working to enhance our digital capabilities across the enterprise to strengthen engagement with patients and providers. For example, we’ve added several features to the CVS Pharmacy app that have improved the customer experience in the pharmacy as well as the front of the store. Benefits include improved adherence as well as savings of both time and money. The aging population has created new growth opportunities and was a key driver of our Omnicare acquisition The nation’s aging population will play a major role in the evolving health care market, and it will create new opportunities for CVS Health. The number of people 65 or older is expected to grow 18 percent in just the next five years—and 38 percent through 2025. This demographic utilizes more than double the number of prescriptions of the under-65 population, creating a long-term tailwind for the industry. Increased utilization, combined with growth in specialty medications, is expected to fuel a 6 percent rise in prescription expenditures annually over the next decade. With this projected growth in prescription expenditures, it’s important to keep in mind that pharmacy care remains the most cost-effective way of reducing overall health care costs. Getting and keeping patients on the necessary medications to manage chronic diseases can drive billions of dollars in costs out of the system. Compared with our peers, we have more ways in which we can touch patients to help drive adherence and improve outcomes—from our retail, mail, and specialty pharmacies to our MinuteClinic locations and now through Omnicare. Approximately 70 percent of people over age 65 are likely to require some form of long-term care service and support. The Omnicare acquisition bolsters our ability to serve this population across the continuum of senior care. Omnicare’s nationwide footprint includes a significant presence in both the assisted living and skilled nursing facility settings, giving us broad reach and an ability to leverage clinical insights to improve care. Through our combined enterprise assets, we will also bridge some of the historic gaps in Omnicare’s offerings to better address the unmet needs of these high-risk populations. For example, Omnicare’s robust offering for the skilled nursing facility market did not include a complete solution to address care coordination issues during a patient’s admittance or discharge. With roughly 9,600 retail locations, we can ensure the timeliness of medication adherence through first-fill and emergency prescriptions, reducing the potential for costly hospital readmissions. In addition, we’ve launched an integrated discharge solution that will coordinate care and offer the CVS Health suite of services to patients returning home. We are developing integrated solutions for the assisted living, independent living, and home care markets as well. Before signing off, I must note with pride the more than $80 million we contributed to our communities in 2015 through the CVS Health Foundation, CVS Health Charity Classic, corporate grants, gifts in-kind, and employee giving. That total also includes the more than $7.5 million raised for the American Lung Association’s LUNG FORCE as well as Stand Up to Cancer through our two in-store campaigns. Moreover, our remarkable colleagues volunteered their time to a broad range of community outreach programs and donated nearly $1 million to the causes they care most about. They also supported the CVS Health Employee Relief Fund that helps colleagues who have suffered significant hardship as a result of a natural disaster, family death, medical emergency, or other unforeseen events. In closing, I am confident that our leadership across the pharmacy spectrum will help us continue to drive superior value for our health care partners and shareholders. As we expand our core pharmacy business, we will also broaden our reach into new health care channels and make investments to drive sustainable enterprise growth. On behalf of our board of directors and our more than 240,000 colleagues who work hard each and every day to help people on their path to better health, thank you for investing in CVS Health.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2016,"Health care continues to evolve rapidly in the United States. Despite the ongoing changes as well as uncertainty surrounding health care reform, CVS Health believes that the winners in our industry will be those who drive more affordable, accessible, and effective care. We are uniquely positioned to meet any challenges head on and pivot as needed to address any policy changes. We continue to have the most extensive suite of enterprise assets, each of which would be a market leader on a standalone basis. Yet what really sets them apart is our ability, largely through technology, to integrate pharmacy care from the payor to the provider to the patient. Our success at integrating our assets enables us to offer innovative services and to deliver additional value to stakeholders. Products such as Maintenance Choice ® and Specialty Connect ® are unmatched in the marketplace. They remain the gold standard in giving patients choice while also delivering substantial savings to payors. Moreover, with our truly integrated assets, we have a full view of each patient and a single patient record for prescriptions and care regardless of the CVS Health channel used. We think of our CVS Pharmacy ® locations as the “front door of health care.” They give us a significant advantage in the marketplace as the retailization of health care continues, with consumer-directed health plans putting more incentive into the hands of patients to make cost-effective decisions regarding their health. Our research has found that face-to-face interactions are two to three times more effective than other interactions at increasing adherence and improving health outcomes. Importantly, CVS Health also owns the last mile in the delivery of care. Our unmatched touch points—from retail and mail to specialty, medical clinics, long-term care, and infusion—put us in direct contact with health care consumers every day. This letter will provide additional insight into these topics as well as update you on our results across the enterprise. We have many accomplishments to look back on, including a successful PBM selling season, superior specialty growth, and the progress we made at integrating the 2015 acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target. We also excelled at managing rising drug costs—or “trend.” As always, I’ll start with a brief overview of CVS Health’s financial performance and outlook.
Robust cash flow provides a strong platform for future growth In 2016, we benefited from our ongoing focus on the three key financial pillars that we consider essential to maximizing shareholder value: • Driving productive, long-term growth; • Generating significant levels of free cash flow; and • Optimizing capital allocation. Net revenues for the year increased nearly 16 percent to a record $177 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 13 percent to $5.84. The compound annual growth rate in operating profit and adjusted EPS puts us at the high end of the steady state growth targets we introduced in 2013. We experienced strong organic prescription growth across the enterprise in 2016, augmented by the Omnicare and Target acquisitions. Moreover, the successful CVS Caremark ® PBM selling season of 2015 led to growth in our membership base and claims in 2016. That said, we do expect to experience some headwinds in the near term that will slow earnings growth in 2017, driven primarily by pharmacy network changes announced late in 2016 that are causing some retail prescriptions to migrate out of our pharmacies. Additionally, our entire industry is facing uncertainty surrounding health care reform. All of these factors contributed to a 19 percent decline in CVS Health’s stock price in 2016, although we have still outperformed both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a five- and 10-year basis. We have already developed a four-point plan that will help us generate more robust levels of earnings growth in the years ahead. First, we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy’s compelling retail value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. Our recent announcement that OptumRx members now have the option to fill their 90-day prescriptions at a CVS Pharmacy is just one example. Second, we will continue to innovate to bring new, integrated PBM products to market that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our integrated model. Take Maintenance Choice, which gives plan members the option of receiving their 90-day prescriptions in the mail or through in-store pickup. Its latest iteration, now in the pilot phase, brings convenience to the next level by offering same-day delivery within two to three hours to a member’s home or workplace. Third, we have launched an enterprise streamlining initiative that we expect to result in nearly $3 billion in cumulative savings by 2021. It includes enhancing the efficiency of our shared services functions, optimizing our pharmacy delivery platform, and rationalizing our store footprint. As part of the latter, we expect to close approximately 70 stores in 2017. Many are located close to our CVS Pharmacy locations within Target stores. Finally, we have significant cash generation capabilities that provide us with a variety of ways to grow and return value to shareholders. Free cash flow totaled $8.1 billion in 2016, and we returned $6.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the year. After increasing our quarterly dividend by 21 percent for 2016, our board of directors has approved an additional 18 percent increase for 2017. That marks our 14th consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will also continue to repurchase shares, taking advantage of the recent decline in our stock price. Through dividends and share repurchases, we expect to allocate more than $7 billion in 2017 to enhancing total returns for shareholders. As exemplified by Omnicare and Target, we also use our cash flow for strategic acquisitions and other ventures that supplement our existing asset base and provide a platform for long-term growth. We will continue to identify such opportunities in the future, always taking a disciplined approach to deploying capital. With well-laddered debt maturities and a high triple-B credit rating, we have a healthy balance sheet that provides flexibility and allows us to maximize shareholder value for the long term. In fact, we took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment in 2016 to reduce long-term debt levels and the associated interest expense. PBMs are a key part of the solution to reining in rising drug prices Before discussing CVS Caremark’s performance, I want to address the ongoing rhetoric around drug pricing. New launches at elevated price points and increasing prices of older drugs have contributed to a sense that government interventions are necessary. Some market participants have attempted to paint PBMs as “middle men” in the pharmacy supply chain, taking outsized profits at the expense of patients and payors. This is simply not true. PBMs are the solution, not the problem. That’s why both public and private payors continue to count on PBMs as indispensable partners that help to manage their drug trend. Numerous evaluations from the Federal Trade Commission, Congressional Budget Office, and other government agencies have consistently concluded that PBMs operate in a highly efficient market and drive real savings to the health care economy. And CVS Caremark’s array of cost management solutions have helped to reduce client costs, from an unmanaged gross trend of 11 percent to a managed trend of only 3.2 percent in 2016. In addition, a recent industry study showed that every dollar invested in PBM services returned $6 in savings for clients and members. So, the value of PBMs is quantitatively pretty clear. Now, it is a bigger challenge to negotiate lower prices when there is basically a single product in a category. So, we will continue to encourage the need to create competition within therapeutic classes as a solution to reducing the cost of drugs; whether it’s clearing out the FDA backlog of potential drug approvals, many of which are generics, or increasing the speed to market of new biosimilar agents. High satisfaction rates, integrated offerings, and trend management capabilities are driving growth in CVS Caremark’s book of business CVS Caremark’s integrated model continued to resonate in the marketplace, helping us achieve strong top- and bottom-line growth in 2016. In a highly competitive 2017 selling season, gross new business wins totaled $7.9 billion. That represents more than half of all revenue from clients that switched PBMs. Health plans accounted for approximately two-thirds of our wins, with employers, unions, and government entities comprising the rest.
With our 97 percent retention rate, net new business for 2017 totaled $4.4 billion. This new business provides an important platform to grow dispensing across the enterprise. As an example, let’s look at payors that came on board in 2015. While their members filled 8.4 million retail prescriptions in one of our channels before these payors were clients, we expect their members to fill more than 29 million scripts through one of our channels in 2017. That will be an important driver of share gains. Payors have different reasons for choosing CVS Caremark, from our high client and member satisfaction scores to our ability to control trend. We accomplish the latter in a variety of ways. Among them, CVS Health has been the industry leader in formulary innovations. In 2012, we became the first PBM to exclude high-cost drugs from our formulary in favor of less expensive clinical equivalents. In 2017, we will continue to lead the market in formulary strategy with the inclusion of biosimilars as a key component as well as a new indication-based formulary. We are also monitoring hyperinflationary drug pricing on a real-time basis, enabling rapid response to help reduce the impact on our clients.
Complementing our partnership with health plans, we have broad expertise in government programs. SilverScript ® is the nation’s largest Medicare Part D (Med D) Prescription Drug Plan (PDP), and we are proud that it earned four stars on the government’s annual quality measurement system for the second consecutive year. SilverScript began 2017 with 5.5 million captive PDP lives, including Employee Group Waiver Plans, up 10 percent from the previous year. We serve and support a total of 12.3 million lives under management when you include the Med D and MA-PD offerings of more than 40 of our health plan clients. We provide these clients with operational and consultative services that include making formulary and plan design recommendations. That has helped improve their star ratings and enabled them to grow faster than the market. While the Med D market has averaged 4.8 percent annual growth since 2013, our clients have seen their Med D membership rise by 7.6 percent. CVS Specialty’s unique capabilities help us address the increasing complexity in the industry’s fastestgrowing sector Revenue from the specialty prescriptions we dispense and manage grew to $50 billion in 2016. That is a 27 percent increase over 2015. Since 2013, our dispensed specialty revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 26 percent, compared with 22 percent for the industry. Specialty remains the industry’s fastest-growing sector, and our 28 percent share of the market leads our competitors by a wide margin. Many factors have contributed to our strong performance. Payors value our capabilities in price as well as utilization and site of care management. And our NovoLogix ® technology platform allows us to manage all specialty medications, including those paid under the medical benefit. Even our most sophisticated health plan clients who have been managing specialty on their own can realize incremental savings when they take advantage of our full range of management tools. The complexity of the market and the growing impact of specialty pharmacy on overall drug spending make our integrated PBM/specialty model more relevant than ever. Adherence has risen by 11.4 percent among those enrolled in Specialty Connect ®. Like Maintenance Choice, this product offers specialty patients the option of having their medications delivered by mail or to their CVS Pharmacy location for pick-up. Specialty Connect users choose the latter option 54 percent of the time. Access to new drugs has also played an important role in our performance. Some of these drugs have had limited distribution, and manufacturers can be discriminating evaluators when choosing specialty pharmacy partners. We have secured access to 30 of the 35 limited distribution products generally used in our channels and that have launched in the past two years. That success is a testament to the level of service our specialty pharmacy offers. In 2017, we are rolling out an enhanced specialty model that will further streamline the entire prescription process for physicians and patients while lowering costs for payors.
CVS Pharmacy’s industry-leading care programs and high adherence rates make us a valuable strategic partner CVS Pharmacy same store prescription volumes rose by 3.6 percent in 2016, with same store pharmacy sales up 3.2 percent. With front store same store sales declining by 1.5 percent, total same store sales increased by 1.9 percent. CVS Pharmacy locations now fill more than 1 billion prescriptions annually, and we have captured a 23.8 percent share of U.S. retail prescriptions. Size, scale, and expertise matter in health care. We have more than 9,600 locations with 27,000 retail pharmacists and 73,000 pharmacy technicians who help patients get on—and stay on—their medications. Non-adherence costs the U.S. health care system hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Our deep clinical expertise and industry-leading care programs drive best-in-class adherence rates. For example, we have demonstrated better adherence results than our key competitors for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. Innovations such as first-fill counseling, our signature Pharmacy Advisor ® program, and ScriptSync ® are just a few of the programs that are driving these improved health outcomes. The market innovations we are driving through our retail pharmacy’s integration with CVS Caremark have certainly played an important role in our growth. That said, it’s worth noting that 55 percent of retail prescription growth since 2013 has been driven by share gains with other payors. They value the clinical solutions/capabilities that CVS Pharmacy brings to market to keep their members healthy. We are successfully leveraging the Omnicare and Target acquisitions; MinuteClinic continues to enhance our value proposition Now let me bring you up to date on our Omnicare and Target acquisitions. I’ll start with Omnicare, the nation’s leading provider of pharmacy services to the long-term care market. Omnicare dispenses approximately 100 million scripts annually to more than 1 million patients. We are using our retail footprint and extensive operational expertise to help improve efficiency and productivity in Omnicare’s core business of serving skilled nursing facilities. For example, 77 percent of Omnicare’s customers live within three miles of a CVS Pharmacy. That means we can fill prescriptions for them much more quickly in emergency situations. We have several initiatives underway as well to accelerate growth in the assisted living and independent living markets. Moving on to Target, last year’s acquisition of its nearly 1,700 pharmacies expanded our retail footprint by more than 20 percent. It also gave us a presence in new regions such as Seattle, Denver, Portland, and Salt Lake City. We have successfully completed the integration and are now focused on converting more of Target’s 30 million weekly guests into CVS Pharmacy customers. We are making good progress and moving in the right direction, with script performance improving versus prior quarters. This is driven by the strength of our patient care programs as well as Maintenance Choice.
The Target deal included the acquisition of nearly 80 retail clinics that we have since rebranded as MinuteClinic locations. In total, we operate more than 1,100 clinics across 33 states, three times more than our next-largest competitor. And MinuteClinic’s nearly 3,000 nurse practitioners and physician assistants have logged more than 34 million patient visits to date. MinuteClinic enhances the CVS Pharmacy value proposition in a variety of ways. Perhaps most importantly, it is up to 80 percent less expensive than other sites of care, such as the emergency room. In 2017, approximately 4 million CVS Caremark plan members will have an opportunity to benefit from the MinuteClinic Savings Strategy program. This integrated offering provides PBM members with reduced or zero co-pays. MinuteClinic is also partnering with health systems on population health strategies and engaging patients through a convenient and consumerfriendly experience. In fact, MinuteClinic and the Department of Veterans Affairs recently partnered to expand access to high-quality and convenient health care services for veterans in Northern California.
Health and Beauty, ExtraCare®, and digital initiatives drive front store performance In the front of the store, we have focused on ways of enhancing the pharmacy experience and driving profitable margin growth for the enterprise. Our emphasis on health and beauty—categories closely tied to pharmacy—helped us accomplish both. Health and beauty offer profit margins that are higher than the average of other front-store categories, and sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 3.5 percent since 2011. We also continued to have success with store brands, which offer higher margins than national brands and now comprise more than 22 percent of frontstore sales. We believe that their penetration rate can reach 25 percent in the coming years.
Among other front store initiatives, we have continued to shift our promotional dollars from mass circulars to digital and personalized offers. In particular, we have focused on the top 30 percent of customers that account for 75 percent of our margins. The ExtraCare loyalty program, now in its 19th year, helps us identify and engage these highervalue shoppers. Our digital offerings complement and leverage our brickand-mortar locations to make the shopping experience even more convenient. As an example, we launched CVS Curbside in roughly 4,000 stores across 40 markets in late 2016. With this new service, customers can use the CVS smartphone app to have purchases delivered to their car when they pull up to the store. For parents with young children or people with mobility issues, we believe that this is a compelling offering. We expect to add a similar option for pharmacy as well. Our social responsibility initiatives include a major anti-tobacco effort No discussion of CVS Health would be complete without acknowledging the broad and ambitious social responsibility initiatives underway across the enterprise. You can read about them in detail in our comprehensive 2016 corporate social responsibility (CSR) report, which will be available in May. I’ll mention just a couple here. We completed the removal of tobacco products from our stores in 2014. Through the Be the First initiative we launched in 2016, we have made a five-year, $50 million commitment to help people lead tobacco-free lives. We are supporting education, advocacy, tobacco control, and healthy behavior programming in partnership with organizations uniquely positioned to tackle this public health challenge. In addition to our tobacco-related efforts, through Project Health we have provided more than $113 million worth of free health services, such as biometric screenings and health insurance education, at select CVS Pharmacy locations throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. These efforts support our corporate purpose of helping people on their path to better health. In closing, I want to thank our board of directors, our shareholders, and the 250,000 colleagues who have played a significant role in CVS Health’s achievements. Because of them, we are able to deliver a compelling business model that offers benefits in savings, accessibility, and outcomes across the health care spectrum. If you haven’t done so already, I encourage you to read the rest of this report to learn more about our unique capabilities.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2017,"Health care costs in the United States are rising at a remarkable pace, driven in large part by an aging population and the increased prevalence of chronic disease. To address today’s challenges and play a larger role in the evolution of health care, CVS Health has assembled a unique suite of assets that allows us to deliver superior outcomes at a lower cost. Beyond their formidable standalone capabilities, we’ve integrated these assets to fill unmet needs and create opportunities to redefine health care for all our stakeholders. Our planned acquisition of Aetna, one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits companies, represents another leg of this journey. Through our unmatched patient touchpoints, CVS Health already owns the “front door” of our customers’ health care experience. Our combined companies will help to remake this experience, integrating more closely the work of doctors, pharmacists, other health care professionals, and health benefits companies. The deal is still going through regulatory approvals, and we currently anticipate it closing during the second half of 2018. Revenue continued to rise in 2017, with progress made on plan for sustainable earnings growth Before going into more detail on our accomplishments and challenges, I’ll first provide a brief overview of the past year’s financial performance. Net revenue for the year increased by 4.1 percent to a record $184.8 billion, with adjusted earnings per share up slightly at $5.90. I’m happy to report that we have also made meaningful gains in the four-point plan we laid out in 2016 to generate more robust levels of earnings growth in the years ahead. Let me highlight some key steps in the progress we have made. First, CVS Pharmacy® has partnered more broadly with pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and health plans. Our network arrangements with Cigna, OptumRx, and Express Scripts, as well as expanded Medicare Part D preferred network arrangements, should drive meaningful growth in CVS Pharmacy prescription volumes. On the innovation front, we continued to introduce PBM products—such as Transform Diabetes Care™—that lower client costs while improving care for members. We also unveiled a new performance-based pharmacy network that is anchored by CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, and up to 10,000 independent pharmacies. The network is designed not only to deliver unit cost savings, but also to improve clinical outcomes that will help lower overall health care costs. And through real-time benefits, we are putting member-specific formulary information at the prescriber’s fingertips. This allows 
doctors to select clinically appropriate alternatives that may also cost members less. Third, we finished the first year of our enterprise streamlining initiative and are on track to generate cumulative savings of $3 billion by 2021. Among our accomplishments, we have simplified the dispensing process by sharing workload across our mail, retail, and long-term care pharmacy platforms. We are also implementing processes to simplify claims adjudication, enrollment, benefit verification, and related client services. Finally, we used our cash flow to return $6.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2017. Due to the pending Aetna acquisition, we suspended our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2017 and plan to maintain our current annual dividend of $2.00 per share in 2018. Differentiated PBM offerings drive customer satisfaction and new business wins Our PBM, CVS Caremark®, delivered solid growth in 2017, with increases in both revenue and operating profit. Since 2014, we have achieved a 13.9 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for PBM revenue with a 10.6 percent CAGR for operating profit. Turning to 2018, we estimate that PBM net revenues will climb to approximately $134 billion while operating profit for the segment will approach $5 billion. Innovative offerings led to another outstanding selling season, with gross new business wins totaling $6.2 billion for 2018. That figure represents nearly half of all the business that switched PBMs in the latest selling season, with government and union clients accounting for the largest share of new business. Despite the fact that fewer health plans moved to a new PBM, this segment still added nearly $2 billion in revenue. Along with these gains, our PBM recorded a retention rate surpassing 96 percent. That is due in no small part to a continued rise in client satisfaction among the 94 million lives we serve. Moreover, our ability to retain clients has resulted in significant gains in enterprise dispensing. Over time we have developed new plan designs that save our clients money while simultaneously moving share into our channels. For example, the new plan members we enrolled over the past three selling seasons will contribute an additional 40 million prescriptions to the enterprise in 2018. With brand inflation, an aging population, and the rising utilization of specialty drugs, clients depend on us more than ever to slow the rate of drug spending growth—or “trend.” In 2017, we succeeded in reducing trend for commercial clients from 3.2 percent in 2016 to 1.9 percent, the lowest level in five years. We accomplished this through a variety of increasingly sophisticated cost-management strategies, such as our advanced approach to formularies and new or enhanced pharmacy networks. Among other innovations, we are enhancing our flagship Maintenance Choice® product by making it available to a broader range of clients, including fully insured health plans. By giving their members the option of getting 90-day prescriptions at our stores or by mail, we expect to save them money and improve adherence rates. Additionally, we’ve enhanced member benefits with the launch of on-demand home delivery, as well as the rollout of a digital tool that makes it easier to transfer a prescription into our network. Medicare and Medicaid remain important growth drivers, both for CVS Health and our payor clients. Our SilverScript Insurance Company subsidiary, the nation’s largest standalone Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan, continued to perform well in the marketplace. We have built deep expertise in Medicare quality and delivery through our support of 6.1 million members. For the third consecutive year, SilverScript earned four stars (out of a maximum of five) on the government’s annual quality measurement system.
When you include our health plan clients, we support more than 13 million Medicare members. Our differentiated services offer clients a competitive advantage to help their businesses grow. Along with operational and consultative services, we make formulary and plan design recommendations, and also help prepare their annual bids to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The industry’s largest specialty pharmacy leads the way with multiple innovations At CVS Specialty®, revenue from prescriptions we dispense and manage rose 12 percent to $57 billion in 2017. Since 2013, dispensing revenue has increased at a 27 percent CAGR to $35 billion. We remain the largest specialty pharmacy by a considerable margin, resulting in greater scale and stronger purchasing economics. PBM clients value the breadth and depth of our specialty management innovations, which include Accordant nurse case management services, Coram infusion services, and our NovoLogix medical benefit management system. A key differentiator, NovoLogix has helped us win 70 percent of the standalone specialty contracts that have changed hands over the past three years. It currently has 65 million lives under management—spread across 31 health plans—delivering an estimated savings of $2.1 billion to our clients. 
Despite moderating brand drug inflation, the rising significance of specialty generics and biosimilars, and other dynamics that are expected to slow specialty growth, specialty will remain the pharmacy industry’s fastest-growing segment. Specialty’s clinical, administrative, and logistical complexities create opportunities for us to differentiate on price, product, and services. Looking at 2018, we expect to continue outpacing the marketplace by adding another $4 billion in specialty revenue. Innovation will play a key role in our specialty growth, and we have focused on applying it across three areas: driving optimal adherence, streamlining the prescribing process, and managing high-cost disease states. For example, our predictive analytics pilot is helping us understand why any given individual is non-adherent, allowing us to adjust the timing of our interventions and the methodologies we use to close gaps in care. Our Specialty Connect® solution, which allows for pick-up or drop-off of specialty prescriptions at our retail locations, was among our first and most successful efforts at simplifying the specialty patient experience. The ability to integrate with electronic health record systems is now helping us streamline the often-challenging prior authorization process so that physicians get their patients started on specialty therapies more rapidly. CVS Pharmacy remains focused on making pharmacy and everyday health care better for consumers Flat same store prescription volumes, along with reimbursement pressure and generic introductions, led to a 2.6 percent decline in same store sales in 2017. On the plus side, prescriptions grew in our Target pharmacies thanks to the strength of our patient care programs and Maintenance Choice. CVS Pharmacy locations fill 1.1 billion prescriptions annually, and our share of U.S. retail prescriptions exceeds 23 percent. CVS Caremark members have certainly helped us capture market share, but we have also strengthened our relationships with other PBMs and payors. For example, OptumRx has made us the exclusive provider of 90-day in-store prescriptions for one of its networks, and we are also a preferred pharmacy in the Express Scripts diabetes network. In 2018, we expect to see same store prescription volumes rise by at least 6 percent, driven primarily by these broader partnerships with PBMs and health plans, as well as our expanded participation as a preferred pharmacy in a greater number of Medicare Part D networks. We anticipate same store sales growth in the range of 2 percent to 3.5 percent.
We remain focused on making pharmacy and everyday health care better for consumers, and we have the physical and digital assets that customers demand. Our 9,800 retail locations make ours the largest U.S. pharmacy chain, with nearly 70 percent of the population living within three miles of a store. In 2017, our 30,000 retail pharmacists provided more than 140 million face-to-face consultations with customers to discuss dosages, timing, and side effects. We have also expanded delivery options with nationwide next-day delivery and same-day delivery in select cities. Because approximately 50 percent of people do not continue prescriptions as prescribed, we have built the industry’s leading patient care platform. This includes new script pick-up counseling, adherence outreach calls, gaps in care counseling, prescription care counseling, and, where appropriate, helping customers move from 30- to 90-day prescriptions. We’re adding valuable services at retail and investing in the front-store shopping experience Beyond pharmacy, we are adding new services to our stores with the goal of enhancing our position as the front door to consumer health. We already operate more than 1,100 MinuteClinic® locations in 33 states and are expanding its offerings to include monitoring and treatment of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and thyroid disorders. We will also begin rolling out audiology and optical centers in select locations in 2018 following successful pilots. Both offer significantly greater productivity per square foot than comparable areas of our average stores. In the front of the store, we are driving growth by making investments that improve the shopping experience. For example, by the end of 2018 we will have reset nearly 2,000 stores to our popular health and beauty format. Stores that we have already converted are showing an average of 2.5 percent gain in sales as well as improved profitability from their emphasis on these two high-margin categories. Among our other resets and refreshes, we will convert an additional 350 locations to the CVS Pharmacy y más® format to better serve the fast-growing Hispanic market. We are able to identify optimal reset candidates in part through the many insights we have gained from ExtraCare® card users. Launched back in 2001, ExtraCare today has 62 million actively engaged customers. It is supported by a broad range of technologies that help us target and engage high-value shoppers with the right offers—both in the store and digitally—and adjust to changes in consumer behavior. In 2017, cardholders earned $3.6 billion in ExtraCare rewards and savings. CVS Health has made addressing the opioid epidemic a cornerstone of our social responsibility initiatives You can read about some of our social responsibility and sustainability initiatives on pages 6 and 7. I do want to touch on just a couple here, starting with our response to the opioid epidemic. This has become one of the greatest public health threats facing our country, and we owe it to our patients and communities to help provide solutions. CVS Health has been working with policymakers across the country to increase access to naloxone, the medication that rapidly reverses opioid overdose. In early 2018, we also introduced an enhanced opioid utilization management program that limits the supply of opioids dispensed to seven days for certain acute prescriptions for patients who are new to therapy. It also limits the daily dosage of opioids dispensed, based on the strength of the opioid, and requires the use of immediate-release formulations of opioids before extended-release opioids are dispensed. Initial results of this program show that the number of patients new to opioid therapy with an acute condition who received more than a seven-day supply decreased by 70 percent.
I also want to acknowledge here the outstanding work of our colleagues who helped ensure that customers in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico received vital medications both before and after the hurricanes that devastated their communities in 2017. CVS Health colleagues played a critical role in supporting so many of our outreach initiatives. We have proudly supported rebuilding efforts through a $4 million in-store fundraising campaign, along with the donation of more than $7 million worth of critical products and supplies. For a comprehensive review of our efforts, I encourage you to visit CVSHealth.com to download the newly published CVS Health 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report. In closing, I want to thank our board of directors, our shareholders, and the more than 240,000 colleagues who support our vision for the future of health care delivery. If you haven’t already done so, I encourage you to read the pages that preceded this letter to learn more about the unique capabilities that allow CVS Health to improve care, lower costs, and transform the patient experience.

CVS Health,CVS,Healthcare,2018,"Today’s health care system faces a broad range of challenges, from its complexity and lack of support for patients, to a focus on episodic care in a fee-for-service environment. Moreover, fragmentation among various stakeholders all too often leaves patients struggling to manage and coordinate their own care. These factors have led to unnecessary, avoidable spending and inferior outcomes for patients. In fact, research shows that up to 25 percent of the more than $2 trillion the United States spends annually on treating patients with chronic conditions is preventable. I believe that CVS Health is best positioned to tackle these challenges and remake the consumer health care experience. Through our CVS Pharmacy® locations and unique suite of integrated assets, we can open a new front door to health care that is both easier to use and less expensive. What are some of these assets? They include our CVS Caremark® pharmacy benefits business, MinuteClinic®, Coram® infusion services, Accordant® nurse care management, and, of course, our transformative acquisition of Aetna® completed in November 2018. Aetna acquisition creates multiple opportunities for medical cost savings and long-term growth One of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits companies, Aetna broadens CVS Health’s reach and allows us to play a larger role in the health care system. Its focus on the consumer has long mirrored CVS Health’s. Aetna employees have built trusted relationships with 22 million members and created new digital tools and analytical capabilities to proactively engage consumers in their health. At the same time, the company has built solid relationships with high-quality providers. Aetna forms the cornerstone of our new Health Care Benefits segment, which also incorporates our SilverScript® Medicare Part D business in 2019. The nation’s largest standalone Part D Prescription Drug Plan is now part of one of the fastest growing Medicare Advantage providers in the country. Among new options for 2019, we have introduced SilverScript Allure. This enhanced plan offers reduced costs on many brand name drugs through the application of point-of-sale rebates. I’m pleased to report that we have a clear line of sight on more than $750 million of combined company 
synergies by the end of 2020, and we have begun to execute on our plan to achieve that goal. The majority of these synergies will be derived from the reduction of corporate expenses and the integration of our operations. The integration of CVS Health’s and Aetna’s core capabilities represents a much larger, longer-term opportunity. We are already executing on several initiatives we believe will drive above-market growth in this rapidly changing health care environment. Among them, we are expanding our Medicare Advantage business by adding membership in existing markets and through continued geographic expansion. We see opportunities as well within Medicaid, building upon the success we’ve had with recent wins in Kansas and Florida, and are also working to strengthen our commercial offerings. At the community level, we are creating differentiated products and services that will drive meaningful value for both consumers and payors. For example, CVS Health can better manage five common chronic conditions through the tighter integration of pharmacy and medical benefits, a rich clinical data set, and our local assets. We also expect to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions, improve access to lower-cost sites of care, optimize primary care through MinuteClinic, and develop a series of comprehensive programs to better manage complex chronic diseases, such as kidney care and oncology. Importantly, we will make these solutions available to more than just Aetna’s members. An open platform model will serve the needs of all payors, and we expect to have these offerings in the market for the 2021 selling season. The expected medical cost savings will have a tremendous impact on CVS Health’s financial performance as well. Success at slowing the rise in medical costs translates into additional underwriting margin for our health plan customers and for Aetna. We plan to take a portion of those savings and reinvest them back into the business to improve our competitive positioning and, ultimately, increase membership. By introducing new, higher-margin programs and services, we will create a platform that customers want to use and that results in improved retention. We continued to generate significant free cash flow and returned more than $2 billion to shareholders We clearly have reason to be confident in our operating model’s ability to drive profitable, long-term growth and enhance shareholder value. That said, 2018 was not free of challenges as we took $6.1 billion of goodwill impairment charges related to our long-term care business. As a result, GAAP operating income for the year declined by 57.8 percent. Revenues for the year increased by 5.3 percent to a record $194.6 billion, with GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of ($0.57). Adjusted earnings per share* was $7.08, an increase of 19.9 percent versus 2017. These numbers include Aetna’s performance only since the close of the acquisition at the end of November. CVS Health continued to generate significant cash flow in 2018. Cash flow from operations totaled $8.9 billion, with free cash flow reaching $6.8 billion. We used part of our free cash flow to return $2 billion to shareholders based on a dividend of $2.00 per share. We already announced in late 2017 that, due to the Aetna acquisition, we would suspend any dividend increases as well as our share repurchase program. In the near term, we plan to use our free cash flow to fund our dividend and pay down debt to get to our targeted leverage ratio. Multiple drivers spurred PBM revenue gains as clients embraced new cost-saving options CVS Caremark enjoyed a strong 2018, with revenues rising 2.7 percent to $134.1 billion. Specialty pharmacy was also a key driver of PBM revenue in 2018, with rising volumes stemming from net new business. Operating income for the segment rose to $4.7 billion. Gross new business wins from our 2019 selling season totaled $4.2 billion, resulting in $1.7 billion in net new business. Client satisfaction was evident in our 98 percent retention rate. 
Current and new clients have responded enthusiastically to our Guaranteed Net Cost model, a new approach to pricing PBM services that we announced in December. We have also seen rapid adoption of the real-time benefits solution that we introduced in late 2017. Meanwhile, our Maintenance Choice® offerings continue to attract new customers. Maintenance Choice gives plan members the choice of obtaining their 90-day maintenance medications by mail or at any CVS retail pharmacy with no increase in co-pay or payor pricing. At the end of 2018, we had nearly 28 million lives enrolled. In-store prescription volumes continued to rise while we also introduced new concept stores and pilot programs Despite reimbursement pressures, revenues rose by 5.8 percent to $84.0 billion in our Retail/LTC segment. That result was due primarily to a 9.1 percent increase in same store prescription volumes (on a 30-day equivalent basis), the continued adoption of our patient care programs, alliances with PBMs and health plans, our inclusion in a number of additional Part D networks this year, and brand drug price inflation. CVS Pharmacy’s share of U.S. retail prescriptions now exceeds 25 percent. Our retail pharmacies are foundational to our community health strategy and one of the keys in our efforts to simplify the patient journey. To that end, we are opening a series of HealthHUB® concept stores that will be a testing ground for a new retail engagement model that brings health care services to consumers in a more convenient, more accessible, and more customer-focused manner. As we pilot new programs and service offerings, we will identify the solutions that are most effective and roll them out more broadly across our footprint. We have also recently launched multiple pilot programs to improve the management of chronic conditions for many of Aetna’s members. In the front of the store, we successfully executed on our plan for top- and bottom-line growth through improved customer personalization and engagement. We are on a continued journey to understand and anticipate the unique needs of each customer that will help us deliver the most relevant experience to meet their needs. We continue to leverage our ExtraCare® loyalty program and data analytics to identify and elevate the categories and brands our customers love. Based on a customer’s individual preference and propensity to buy in the near future, we can recommend the right brand at the right time in any of our sales channels—bringing personalization to the next level. GHG reductions, anti-smoking initiatives, and efforts at combating opioid addiction highlight our CSR commitments We take a great deal of pride in the depth and breadth of our corporate social responsibility (CSR) commitments—from ambitious efforts at combating opioid addiction to our “Be the First” initiative to deliver the nation’s first tobacco-free generation. You can read more about our CSR activities on page 14. I do want to acknowledge here, though, the nearly $100 million that CVS Health and the CVS Health Foundation contributed in 2018 to a broad range of community health programs and disaster relief efforts through a combination of grants, in-kind product contributions, and volunteer hours. I am also gratified that our greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-reduction targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As part of our goal, CVS Health is committed to reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 36 percent by 2030 from a 2010 base year. We have also committed to have 70 percent of our suppliers by emissions set science-based reduction targets on their scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2023.

In closing, I want to thank our board of directors, our shareholders, and the more than 290,000 colleagues who contribute on a daily basis to our work as health care innovators. If you haven’t already done so, please take a few minutes to read the pages that preceded this letter to learn more about the extraordinary work we are doing to create a better health care experience for the patients and clients that we serve. We are developing a uniquely powerful new platform that will enable us to transform the consumer health care experience.
